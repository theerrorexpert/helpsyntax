RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()    RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores  a DB cluster to an arbitrary point in time. Users can restore
       to any point in time before LatestRestorableTime for up to BackupReten-
       tionPeriod  days.  The  target DB cluster is created from the source DB
       cluster with the same configuration as the original DB cluster,  except
       that  the new DB cluster is created with the default DB security group.

       NOTE:
          This action only restores the DB cluster, not the DB  instances  for
          that  DB  cluster.  You  must invoke the  CreateDBInstance action to
          create DB instances for the  restored  DB  cluster,  specifying  the
          identifier  of  the restored DB cluster in DBClusterIdentifier . You
          can create DB instances only after the RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime
          action has completed and the DB cluster is available.

          (Not supported by Neptune)

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of VPC security groups that the new DB cluster belongs to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be applied to the restored DB cluster.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain  the
                 set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/',
                 '=', '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted  DB
          cluster from an encrypted DB cluster.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption key. If you are restoring a DB cluster with the same Ama-
          zon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new
          DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead  of  the  ARN
          for the KMS encryption key.

          You  can  restore to a new DB cluster and encrypt the new DB cluster
          with a KMS key that is different than the KMS key  used  to  encrypt
          the  source DB cluster. The new DB cluster is encrypted with the KMS
          key identified by the KmsKeyId parameter.

          If you do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter,  then  the
          following will occur:

          o If  the  DB  cluster is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is
            encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source DB
            cluster.

          o If  the  DB cluster is not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster
            is not encrypted.

          If DBClusterIdentifier refers to a DB cluster that is not encrypted,
          then the restore request is rejected.

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          True to enable mapping of  Amazon  Identity  and  Access  Management
          (IAM) accounts to database accounts, and otherwise false.

          Default: false

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The list of logs that the restored DB cluster is to export to Cloud-
          Watch Logs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --db-cluster-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the DB cluster parameter group to associate with the new
          DB cluster.

          Constraints:

          o If  supplied,  must match the name of an existing DBClusterParame-
            terGroup.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has  deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection is disabled.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB cluster.

          This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClus-
          ters action.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              AllocatedStorage  always  returns  1, because Neptune DB cluster
              storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts  as
              needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
              the DB cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains  the  name  of  the initial database of this DB cluster
              that was provided at create time, if one was specified when  the
              DB  cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This  identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster,  including  the  name,  description, and subnets in the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the earliest time to which a database can be  restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint  for
              a  DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read Replicas
              that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new  con-
              nections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connec-
              tion requests among the Read Replicas in the  DB  cluster.  This
              functionality  can help balance your read workload across multi-
              ple Read Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Read Replica  that  you  are  con-
              nected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Read  Replicas  in  the  cluster,  you can then reconnect to the
              reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              Indicates the database engine version.

          LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the latest time to which a database  can  be  restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

              Specifies  the  daily  time range during which automated backups
              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies the status of the DB  cluster  parameter  group
                     for this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A  value that specifies the order in which a Read Replica
                     is promoted to the primary instance after  a  failure  of
                     the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  VPC  security  groups that the DB cluster
              belongs to.

              (structure)
                 This data type is used as a response element for  queries  on

              the encrypted DB cluster.

          DbClusterResourceId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Region-unique, immutable identifier for the DB clus-
              ter. This identifier is found in Amazon CloudTrail  log  entries
              whenever the Amazon KMS key for the DB cluster is accessed.

          DBClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  the Amazon Identity and Access Management
              (IAM) roles that are associated with the DB cluster.  IAM  roles
              that  are  associated with a DB cluster grant permission for the
              DB cluster to access other Amazon services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes an Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role

                 Status -> (string)
                     Describes the state of association between the  IAM  role
                     and  the  DB  cluster. The Status property returns one of
                     the following values:

                     o ACTIVE - the IAM role ARN is  associated  with  the  DB
                       cluster and can be used to access other Amazon services
                       on your behalf.

                       DB cluster.

                     o INVALID  -  the  IAM role ARN is associated with the DB
                       cluster, but the DB cluster is unable to assume the IAM
                       role  in  order to access other Amazon services on your
                       behalf.

          IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
              True if mapping of Amazon Identity and Access  Management  (IAM)
              accounts to database accounts is enabled, and otherwise false.

          CloneGroupId -> (string)
              Identifies  the  clone  group to which the DB cluster is associ-
              ated.

          ClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the time when the DB cluster was created, in Universal
              Coordinated Time (UTC).
