DELETE-DB-CLUSTER()                                        DELETE-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       The DeleteDBCluster action deletes a previously provisioned DB cluster.
       When you delete a DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster
       are  deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the
       specified DB cluster are not deleted.

       Note that the DB Cluster cannot be deleted if  deletion  protection  is
       enabled.  To delete it, you must first set its DeletionProtection field
       to False .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-cluster
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot]
          [--final-db-snapshot-identifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster  to  be  deleted.  This
          parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier.

       --skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot (boolean)
          Determines whether a final DB cluster snapshot is created before the
          DB cluster is deleted. If true is specified, no DB cluster  snapshot
          is  created. If false is specified, a DB cluster snapshot is created
          before the DB cluster is deleted.

          NOTE:
              You must specify a FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier parameter if  Skip-
              FinalSnapshot is false .

          Default: false

       --final-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  snapshot identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot
          created when SkipFinalSnapshot is set to false .

          NOTE:
              Specifying this parameter and also setting the SkipFinalShapshot
              parameter to true results in an error.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB cluster.

          This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClus-
          ters action.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because  Neptune  DB  cluster
              storage  size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as
              needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones  that  instances  in
              the DB cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number  of days for which automatic DB snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains the name of the initial database  of  this  DB  cluster
              that  was provided at create time, if one was specified when the
              DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the  life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the  DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets  in  the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies  the earliest time to which a database can be restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read  Replicas
              that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new con-
              nections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connec-
              tion  requests  among  the Read Replicas in the DB cluster. This
              functionality can help balance your read workload across  multi-
              ple Read Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover  occurs,  and the Read Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Read Replicas in the cluster, you  can  then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  DB  cluster  has  instances in multiple
              Availability Zones.

              Indicates the database engine version.

          LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies  the  latest  time to which a database can be restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

              Specifies the daily time range during  which  automated  backups
              are  created  if automated backups are enabled, as determined by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the weekly time range during which system  maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A value that specifies the order in which a Read  Replica
                     is  promoted  to  the primary instance after a failure of
                     the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides a list of VPC  security  groups  that  the  DB  cluster
              belongs to.

              (structure)
                 This  data  type is used as a response element for queries on
                 VPC security group membership.

              the encrypted DB cluster.

          DbClusterResourceId -> (string)
              The Amazon Region-unique, immutable identifier for the DB  clus-
              ter.  This  identifier is found in Amazon CloudTrail log entries
              whenever the Amazon KMS key for the DB cluster is accessed.

          DBClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides a list of the Amazon  Identity  and  Access  Management
              (IAM)  roles  that are associated with the DB cluster. IAM roles
              that are associated with a DB cluster grant permission  for  the
              DB cluster to access other Amazon services on your behalf.

              (structure)

                     associated with the DB cluster.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Describes  the  state of association between the IAM role
                     and the DB cluster. The Status property  returns  one  of
                     the following values:

                     o ACTIVE  -  the  IAM  role ARN is associated with the DB
                       cluster and can be used to access other Amazon services

                       DB cluster.

                     o INVALID - the IAM role ARN is associated  with  the  DB
                       cluster, but the DB cluster is unable to assume the IAM
                       role in order to access other Amazon services  on  your
