DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to DB instances, DB security groups, DB snap-
       shots, and DB parameter groups for the past 14 days. Events specific to
       a  particular  DB instance, DB security group, database snapshot, or DB
       parameter group can be obtained by providing the name as  a  parameter.
       By default, the past hour of events are returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Events

OPTIONS
       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If
          not specified, then all sources are included in the response.

          Constraints:

          o If SourceIdentifier is supplied, SourceType must also be provided.

          o If the source type is DBInstance  ,  then  a  DBInstanceIdentifier
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is DBSecurityGroup , a DBSecurityGroupName must
            be supplied.

          o If the source type is DBParameterGroup  ,  a  DBParameterGroupName
            must be supplied.

          o If  the source type is DBSnapshot , a DBSnapshotIdentifier must be
            supplied.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --source-type (string)
          The event source to retrieve events for. If no value  is  specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o db-instance

          o db-parameter-group

          o db-security-group

          o db-snapshot

          o db-cluster

          o db-cluster-snapshot

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, go  to  the
          ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2009-07-08T18:00Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, go  to  the
          ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2009-07-08T18:00Z

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes to retrieve events for.

          Default: 60

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of  event categories that trigger notifications for a event
          notification subscription.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional pagination token provided by a previous Events request.

          beyond the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       Events -> (list)
          A list of  Event instances.

          (structure)
              This   data   type   is  used  as  a  response  element  in  the
              DescribeEvents action.

              SourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 Provides the identifier for the source of the event.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies the source type for this event.

              Message -> (string)

              EventCategories -> (list)
