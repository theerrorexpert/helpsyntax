NAME
       describe-db-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about provisioned DB clusters, and supports pagina-
       tion.

       NOTE:
          This operation can also return information for Amazon  RDS  clusters
          and Amazon DocDB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-clusters  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DBClusters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-clusters
          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The user-supplied DB cluster identifier. If this parameter is speci-
          fied,  information  from  only  the specific DB cluster is returned.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB clusters to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon  Resource  Names  (ARNs).  The  results list will only include
            information about the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.

          o engine - Accepts an engine name (such as neptune ), and  restricts
            the results list to DB clusters created by that engine.

          For  example,  to  invoke this API from the Amazon CLI and filter so
          that only Neptune DB clusters are returned, you could use  the  fol-
          lowing command:

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in a subsequent  DescribeDBClus-
          ters request.

          Contains a list of DB clusters for the user.

          (structure)
              Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB cluster.

              This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDB-
              Clusters action.

              AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Neptune DB cluster
                 storage  size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts
                 as needed.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
                 the DB cluster can be created in.

                 (string)

              BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of days for which automatic DB snapshots
                 are retained.

              CharacterSetName -> (string)
                 Not supported by Neptune.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Contains the name of the initial database of this DB  cluster
                 that  was  provided at create time, if one was specified when
                 the DB cluster was created. This same name  is  returned  for
                 the life of the DB cluster.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identi-
                 fier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

              DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for  the
                 DB cluster.

              DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the
                 DB cluster, including the name, description, and  subnets  in
                 the subnet group.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

              PercentProgress -> (string)
                 Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

              EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies  the  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be
                 restored with point-in-time restore.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 Specifies the connection endpoint for the primary instance of
                 the DB cluster.

              ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
                 The  reader  endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint
                 for a DB cluster load-balances connections  across  the  Read
                 Replicas  that  are  available  in  a  DB cluster. As clients
                 request new connections to the reader endpoint, Neptune  dis-
                 tributes  the  connection requests among the Read Replicas in
                 the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read
                 workload across multiple Read Replicas in your DB cluster.

                 If  a failover occurs, and the Read Replica that you are con-
                 nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  con-
                 nection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
                 other Read Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to
                 the reader endpoint.

              MultiAZ -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the  DB cluster has instances in multiple
                 Availability Zones.

              Engine -> (string)
                 Provides the name of the database engine to be used for  this
                 DB cluster.

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 Indicates the database engine version.

              LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the latest time to which a database can be restored
                 with point-in-time restore.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Specifies the port that the database engine is listening  on.

                 Specifies the daily time range during which automated backups
                 are created if automated backups are enabled,  as  determined
                 by the BackupRetentionPeriod .

              PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  weekly time range during which system mainte-
                 nance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

                     DBInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                        Specifies the instance identifier for this  member  of
                        the DB cluster.

                     IsClusterWriter -> (boolean)
                        Value  that  is true if the cluster member is the pri-
                        mary instance for the DB cluster and false  otherwise.

                     DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                        Specifies the status of the DB cluster parameter group
                        for this member of the DB cluster.

                     PromotionTier -> (integer)
                        A value that specifies  the  order  in  which  a  Read

                 Provides a list of VPC security groups that  the  DB  cluster
                 belongs to.

                 (structure)
                     This  data type is used as a response element for queries
                     on VPC security group membership.

                     VpcSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                        The name of the VPC security group.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The status of the VPC security group.

              HostedZoneId -> (string)
                 Specifies the ID that Amazon Route 53 assigns when you create
                 a hosted zone.

              StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the DB cluster is encrypted.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)

                     Status -> (string)
                        Describes  the  state  of  association between the IAM
                        role and the DB cluster. The Status  property  returns
                        one of the following values:

                        o ACTIVE  - the IAM role ARN is associated with the DB
                          cluster and can be used to access other Amazon  ser-
                          vices on your behalf.

                        o PENDING  - the IAM role ARN is being associated with
                          the DB cluster.

                        o INVALID - the IAM role ARN is associated with the DB
                          cluster,  but the DB cluster is unable to assume the
                          IAM role in order to access other Amazon services on
                          your behalf.

                     FeatureName -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  feature associated with the Amazon
                        Identity and Access Management  (IAM)  role.  For  the
                        list     of     supported     feature    names,    see
                        DescribeDBEngineVersions .

              IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 True if mapping of  Amazon  Identity  and  Access  Management
                 (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled, and otherwise
                 false.

              CloneGroupId -> (string)
                 Identifies the clone group to which the DB cluster is associ-

                 Specifies  the  time when the DB cluster was created, in Uni-
                 versal Coordinated Time (UTC).

              CopyTagsToSnapshot -> (boolean)
                 If set to ``true`` , tags are copied to any snapshot  of  the
                 DB cluster that is created.

              EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports -> (list)
                 A  list  of  log  types that this DB cluster is configured to

                 (string)

              DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether or not the DB cluster has deletion  protec-
                 tion  enabled.  The  database  can't be deleted when deletion
                 protection is enabled.

              CrossAccountClone -> (boolean)
                 If set to  true  ,  the  DB  cluster  can  be  cloned  across
                 accounts.
