NAME
       apply-pending-maintenance-action -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a  pending maintenance action to a resource (for example, to a
       DB instance).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            apply-pending-maintenance-action
          --resource-identifier <value>
          --apply-action <value>
          --opt-in-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  resource  that  the  pending
          maintenance  action  applies  to.  For information about creating an
          ARN, see Constructing an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) .

       --apply-action (string)
          The pending maintenance action to apply to this resource.

          Valid values: system-update , db-upgrade

       --opt-in-type (string)
          A value that specifies the type of  opt-in  request,  or  undoes  an
          opt-in request. An opt-in request of type immediate can't be undone.

          Valid values:

          o immediate - Apply the maintenance action immediately.

          o next-maintenance - Apply the maintenance action  during  the  next
            maintenance window for the resource.

          o undo-opt-in   -   Cancel   any  existing  next-maintenance  opt-in
            requests.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourcePendingMaintenanceActions -> (structure)
          Describes the pending maintenance actions for a resource.

          ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource that has pending maintenance actions.

          PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
              A list that  provides  details  about  the  pending  maintenance
              actions for the resource.

              (structure)
                 Provides information about a pending maintenance action for a
                 resource.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The type of pending maintenance action that is  available
                     for the resource.

                 AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  of  the  maintenance window when the action is
                     applied.  The  maintenance  action  is  applied  to   the
                     resource  during  its first maintenance window after this
                     date. If this date  is  specified,  any  next-maintenance
                     opt-in requests are ignored.

                 ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  when  the  maintenance action is automatically
                     applied.  The  maintenance  action  is  applied  to   the
                     resource  on this date regardless of the maintenance win-
                     dow for the resource. If  this  date  is  specified,  any
                     immediate opt-in requests are ignored.

                 OptInStatus -> (string)
                     Indicates  the  type  of  opt-in  request  that  has been
                     received for the resource.

                 CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The effective date when the pending maintenance action is
                     applied  to  the  resource.  This date takes into account
                     opt-in requests received  from  the   ApplyPendingMainte-
                     nanceAction  API,  the  AutoAppliedAfterDate  ,  and  the
                     ForcedApplyDate .  This  value  is  blank  if  an  opt-in
                     request has not been received and nothing has been speci-
                     fied as AutoAppliedAfterDate or ForcedApplyDate .

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description providing more detail about the maintenance
                     action.
