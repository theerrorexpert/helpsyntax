CREATE-DB-CLUSTER()                                        CREATE-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Amazon Neptune DB cluster.

       You  can use the ReplicationSourceIdentifier parameter to create the DB
       cluster as a Read Replica of another DB cluster or  Amazon  Neptune  DB
       instance.

       Note that when you create a new cluster using CreateDBCluster directly,
       deletion protection is disabled by default (when you create a new  pro-
       duction  cluster  in  the  console,  deletion  protection is enabled by
       default). You can only delete a DB cluster  if  its  DeletionProtection
       field is set to false .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to assign to the new DB cluster.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain  the

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB cluster is encrypted.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption  key. If you are creating a DB cluster with the same Ama-
          zon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new
          DB  cluster,  then  you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN
          for the KMS encryption key.

          If an encryption key is not specified in KmsKeyId :

          o If ReplicationSourceIdentifier  identifies  an  encrypted  source,
            then  Amazon  Neptune  will use the encryption key used to encrypt
            the source.  Otherwise,  Amazon  Neptune  will  use  your  default
            encryption key.

          o If  the StorageEncrypted parameter is true and ReplicationSourceI-
            dentifier is not specified, then  Amazon  Neptune  will  use  your
            default encryption key.

          Amazon  KMS  creates  the  default  encryption  key  for your Amazon
          account. Your Amazon account has a different default encryption  key
          for each Amazon Region.

          If  you  create a Read Replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another
          Amazon Region, you must set KmsKeyId to a KMS key ID that  is  valid
          in  the  destination  Amazon Region. This key is used to encrypt the
          Read Replica in that Amazon Region.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          If set to true , enables Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          authentication for the entire DB cluster (this cannot be set  at  an
          instance level).

          Default: false .

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The  list  of  log  types  that  need to be enabled for exporting to
          CloudWatch Logs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has  deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection is enabled.

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the source for the db cluster.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB cluster.

          This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClus-
          ters action.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              AllocatedStorage  always  returns  1, because Neptune DB cluster
              storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts  as
              needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
              the DB cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains  the  name  of  the initial database of this DB cluster
              that was provided at create time, if one was specified when  the
              DB  cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This  identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster,  including  the  name,  description, and subnets in the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the earliest time to which a database can be  restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint  for
              a  DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read Replicas
              that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new  con-
              nections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connec-
              tion requests among the Read Replicas in the  DB  cluster.  This
              functionality  can help balance your read workload across multi-
              ple Read Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Read Replica  that  you  are  con-
              nected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Read  Replicas  in  the  cluster,  you can then reconnect to the
              reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A  value that specifies the order in which a Read Replica
                     is promoted to the primary instance after  a  failure  of
                     the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  VPC  security  groups that the DB cluster
              belongs to.
