MODIFY-DB-SUBNET-GROUP()                              MODIFY-DB-SUBNET-GROUP()



NAME
       modify-db-subnet-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  an existing DB subnet group. DB subnet groups must contain at
       least one subnet in at least two AZs in the Amazon Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-db-subnet-group
          --db-subnet-group-name <value>
          [--db-subnet-group-description <value>]
          --subnet-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The name for the DB subnet group. This value is stored as  a  lower-
          case string. You can't modify the default subnet group.

          Constraints:  Must match the name of an existing DBSubnetGroup. Must
          not be default.

          Example: mySubnetgroup

       --db-subnet-group-description (string)
          The description for the DB subnet group.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The EC2 subnet IDs for the DB subnet group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBSubnetGroup -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB subnet group.

          This data type is used as a response element in the   DescribeDBSub-
          netGroups action.

          DBSubnetGroupName -> (string)
              The name of the DB subnet group.

          DBSubnetGroupDescription -> (string)
              Provides the description of the DB subnet group.

          VpcId -> (string)
              Provides the VpcId of the DB subnet group.

          SubnetGroupStatus -> (string)
              Provides the status of the DB subnet group.

          Subnets -> (list)
              Contains a list of  Subnet elements.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a subnet.

                 This  data  type  is  used  as  a  response  element  in  the
                 DescribeDBSubnetGroups action.

                 SubnetIdentifier -> (string)
                     Specifies the identifier of the subnet.

                 SubnetAvailabilityZone -> (structure)
                     Specifies the EC2 Availability Zone that  the  subnet  is
                     in.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the availability zone.

                 SubnetStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies the status of the subnet.

          DBSubnetGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB subnet group.
