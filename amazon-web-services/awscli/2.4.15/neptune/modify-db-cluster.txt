OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  identifier  for  the  cluster being modified. This
          parameter is not case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.

       --new-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The new DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster when renaming a  DB
          cluster. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens

          o The first character must be a letter

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-cluster2

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          A value that specifies whether the modifications in this request and
          any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as pos-
          sible,  regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the
          DB cluster. If this parameter is set to false , changes  to  the  DB
          cluster are applied during the next maintenance window.

          The  ApplyImmediately  parameter only affects NewDBClusterIdentifier
          values. If you set the ApplyImmediately parameter  value  to  false,
          then changes to NewDBClusterIdentifier values are applied during the
          next maintenance window. All other changes are applied  immediately,
          regardless of the value of the ApplyImmediately parameter.

          Default: false

       --backup-retention-period (integer)
          The  number  of  days  for which automated backups are retained. You
          must specify a minimum value of 1.

       --engine-version (string)
          The version number of the database  engine  to  which  you  want  to
          upgrade. Changing this parameter results in an outage. The change is
          applied during the next maintenance window unless  the  ApplyImmedi-
          ately parameter is set to true.

          For  a list of valid engine versions, see Engine Releases for Amazon
          Neptune , or call DescribeDBEngineVersions .

              nance window but instead are applied immediately.

          Default: The existing name setting

          Constraints:

          o The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter group fam-
            ily as the target DB cluster version.

          o The DBInstanceParameterGroupName parameter is only valid in combi-
            nation with the AllowMajorVersionUpgrade parameter.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether the DB cluster has deletion protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection is disabled.

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          If set to ``true`` , tags are copied to any snapshot of the DB clus-
          ter that is created.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB cluster.

          ters action.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              AllocatedStorage  always  returns  1, because Neptune DB cluster
              storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts  as
              needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
              the DB cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains  the  name  of  the initial database of this DB cluster
              that was provided at create time, if one was specified when  the
              DB  cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This  identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster,  including  the  name,  description, and subnets in the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the earliest time to which a database can be  restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint  for
              a  DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read Replicas
              that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new  con-
              nections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connec-
              tion requests among the Read Replicas in the  DB  cluster.  This
              functionality  can help balance your read workload across multi-
              ple Read Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Read Replica  that  you  are  con-
              nected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Read  Replicas  in  the  cluster,  you can then reconnect to the
              reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              Specifies the latest time to which a database  can  be  restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

              Specifies  the  daily  time range during which automated backups
              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies the status of the DB  cluster  parameter  group
                     for this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A  value that specifies the order in which a Read Replica
                     is promoted to the primary instance after  a  failure  of
                     the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  VPC  security  groups that the DB cluster
              belongs to.

              (structure)
                 This data type is used as a response element for  queries  on

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  the Amazon Identity and Access Management
              (IAM) roles that are associated with the DB cluster.  IAM  roles
              that  are  associated with a DB cluster grant permission for the
              DB cluster to access other Amazon services on your behalf.

              (structure)

                     Describes the state of association between the  IAM  role
                     and  the  DB  cluster. The Status property returns one of
                     the following values:

                     o ACTIVE - the IAM role ARN is  associated  with  the  DB
                       cluster and can be used to access other Amazon services
