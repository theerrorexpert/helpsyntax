CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  event  notification  subscription.  This action requires a
       topic ARN (Amazon Resource Name) created by either the Neptune console,
       the  SNS  console,  or the SNS API. To obtain an ARN with SNS, you must
       create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the  topic.  The  ARN  is
       displayed in the SNS console.

       You can specify the type of source (SourceType) you want to be notified
       of, provide a list of Neptune sources  (SourceIds)  that  triggers  the
       events,  and  provide  a list of event categories (EventCategories) for
       events you want to be notified of. For example, you can specify Source-
       Type = db-instance, SourceIds = mydbinstance1, mydbinstance2 and Event-
       Categories = Availability, Backup.

       If you specify both the SourceType and SourceIds, such as SourceType  =
       db-instance  and  SourceIdentifier = myDBInstance1, you are notified of
       all the db-instance events for the specified source. If you  specify  a
       SourceType but do not specify a SourceIdentifier, you receive notice of
       the events for that source type for all your Neptune sources. If you do
       not  specify  either  the  SourceType nor the SourceIdentifier, you are
       notified of events generated from all Neptune sources belonging to your
       customer account.

SYNOPSIS
            create-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          --sns-topic-arn <value>
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--source-ids <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the subscription.

          Constraints: The name must be less than 255 characters.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the SNS topic created for event
          notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS  when  you  create  a
          topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The  type  of  source that is generating the events. For example, if
          you want to be notified of events generated by a  DB  instance,  you
          would set this parameter to db-instance. if this value is not speci-
          fied, all events are returned.

          Valid  values:  db-instance  |  db-cluster  |  db-parameter-group  |
          db-security-group | db-snapshot | db-cluster-snapshot

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of  event categories for a SourceType that you want to sub-
          scribe to. You can see a list of the categories for a given  Source-
          Type by using the DescribeEventCategories action.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-ids (list)
          The  list  of  identifiers of the event sources for which events are
          returned. If not specified, then all sources  are  included  in  the
          response.  An  identifier  must begin with a letter and must contain
          only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a  hyphen
          or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Constraints:

          o If SourceIds are supplied, SourceType must also be provided.

          o If  the  source type is a DB instance, then a DBInstanceIdentifier
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB security group,  a  DBSecurityGroupName
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB parameter group, a DBParameterGroupName
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB snapshot, a  DBSnapshotIdentifier  must
            be supplied.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value;  set to true to activate the subscription, set to
          false to create the subscription but not active it.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be applied to the new event subscription.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of  a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain the
                 set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',  '.',  '/',
                 '=', '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't
                 be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can  only  contain
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 '/',       '=',       '+',       '-'       (Java       regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
