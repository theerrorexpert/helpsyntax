DESCRIBE-DB-SUBNET-GROUPS()                        DESCRIBE-DB-SUBNET-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-db-subnet-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of DBSubnetGroup descriptions. If a DBSubnetGroupName is
       specified, the list will contain only the descriptions of the specified
       DBSubnetGroup.

       For an overview of CIDR ranges, go to the Wikipedia Tutorial .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-subnet-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: DBSubnetGroups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-subnet-groups
          [--db-subnet-group-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the DB subnet group to return details for.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       DBSubnetGroups -> (list)
          A list of  DBSubnetGroup instances.

          (structure)
              Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB subnet group.

              This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDB-
              SubnetGroups action.

              DBSubnetGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the DB subnet group.

              DBSubnetGroupDescription -> (string)
                 Provides the description of the DB subnet group.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 Provides the VpcId of the DB subnet group.

              SubnetGroupStatus -> (string)
                 Provides the status of the DB subnet group.

              Subnets -> (list)
                 Contains a list of  Subnet elements.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a subnet.

                     This data type is used  as  a  response  element  in  the
                     DescribeDBSubnetGroups action.

                     SubnetIdentifier -> (string)
                        Specifies the identifier of the subnet.

                     SubnetAvailabilityZone -> (structure)
                        Specifies the EC2 Availability Zone that the subnet is
                        in.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the availability zone.

                     SubnetStatus -> (string)
                        Specifies the status of the subnet.

              DBSubnetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB subnet group.
