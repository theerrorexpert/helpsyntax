NAME
       describe-db-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about provisioned instances, and supports pagina-
       tion.

       NOTE:
          This operation can also return information for Amazon RDS  instances
          and Amazon DocDB instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-instances  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DBInstances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-instances
          [--db-instance-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The user-supplied instance identifier. If this parameter  is  speci-
          fied,  information  from  only the specific DB instance is returned.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing  DBInstance.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB instances to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon Resource Names (ARNs). The  results  list  will  only  include
            information about the DB instances associated with the DB clusters
            identified by these ARNs.

          o engine - Accepts an engine name (such as neptune ), and  restricts
            the results list to DB instances created by that engine.

          For  example,  to  invoke this API from the Amazon CLI and filter so
          that only Neptune DB instances are returned, you could use the  fol-
          lowing command:

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
