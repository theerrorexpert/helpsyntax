NAME
       describe-db-cluster-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  DB cluster snapshots. This API action sup-
       ports pagination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-cluster-snapshots is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBClusterSnapshots

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  ID  of  the DB cluster to retrieve the list of DB cluster snap-
          shots for. This parameter can't be  used  in  conjunction  with  the
          DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier   parameter.   This   parameter  is  not
          case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.

       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A specific DB cluster snapshot identifier to describe. This  parame-
          ter can't be used in conjunction with the DBClusterIdentifier param-
          eter. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an  existing  DBCluster-
            Snapshot.

          o If  this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of DB cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one
          of the following values:

          o automated  -  Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been auto-
            matically taken by Amazon Neptune for my Amazon account.

          o manual - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been  taken  by
            my Amazon account.

          o shared  -  Return  all  manual DB cluster snapshots that have been
            shared to my Amazon account.

          o public - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked  as
            public.

          If  you  don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both automated and
          manual DB cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared  DB
          cluster  snapshots  with  these results by setting the IncludeShared
          parameter to true . You can include public DB cluster snapshots with
          these results by setting the IncludePublic parameter to true .

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          True to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from other Amazon
          accounts  that this Amazon account has been given permission to copy
          or restore, and otherwise false. The default is false .

          You can give an Amazon account permission to  restore  a  manual  DB
          cluster  snapshot  from another Amazon account by the  ModifyDBClus-
          terSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          True to include manual DB cluster snapshots that are public and  can
          be  copied  or  restored by any Amazon account, and otherwise false.
          The default is false . The default is false.

          You can share a manual DB cluster snapshot as public  by  using  the
          ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous  DescribeDBClus-
          terSnapshots  request.  If this parameter is specified, the response
          includes only records beyond the marker, up to the  value  specified
          by MaxRecords .

       DBClusterSnapshots -> (list)
          Provides a list of DB cluster snapshots for the user.

          (structure)
              Contains the details for an Amazon Neptune DB cluster snapshot

              This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDB-
              ClusterSnapshots action.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
                 the DB cluster snapshot can be restored in.

                 (string)

              DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  identifier  for  a  DB cluster snapshot. Must
                 match the identifier of an existing snapshot.

                 After you restore a DB cluster using a DBClusterSnapshotIden-
                 tifier  ,  you must specify the same DBClusterSnapshotIdenti-
                 fier for any future updates to the DB cluster. When you spec-
                 ify  this  property  for  an  update,  the  DB cluster is not
                 restored from the snapshot again, and the data in  the  data-
                 base is not changed.

                 However, if you don't specify the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
                 , an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster
                 is  deleted. If you specify a property that is different from
                 the previous snapshot restore property,  the  DB  cluster  is
                 restored  from  the  snapshot specified by the DBClusterSnap-
                 shotIdentifier , and the original DB cluster is deleted.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 Specifies the DB cluster identifier of the  DB  cluster  that
                 this DB cluster snapshot was created from.

                 Specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB).

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies the status of this DB cluster snapshot.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Specifies the port that the DB cluster was  listening  on  at
                 the time of the snapshot.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 Provides  the VPC ID associated with the DB cluster snapshot.

              ClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the time when the DB cluster was created,  in  Uni-
                 versal Coordinated Time (UTC).

                 transferred.

              StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
