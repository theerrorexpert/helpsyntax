LIST-WEBHOOKS()                                                LIST-WEBHOOKS()



NAME
       list-webhooks -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a listing of all the webhooks in this AWS Region for this account.
       The output lists all webhooks and includes the webhook URL and ARN  and
       the configuration for each webhook.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-webhooks  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: webhooks

SYNOPSIS
            list-webhooks
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list webhooks

       The  following  list-webhooks  example  retrieves  a  list  of all tags
       attached to the specified pipeline resource.

          aws codepipeline list-webhooks \
              --endpoint-url "https://codepipeline.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com" \
              --region "eu-central-1"

       Output:

          {
              "webhooks": [
                  {
                      "url": "https://webhooks.domain.com/trigger111111111EXAMPLE11111111111111111": {
                          "authenticationConfiguration": {
                              "SecretToken": "Secret"
                          },
                          "name": "my-webhook",
                          "authentication": "GITHUB_HMAC",
                          "targetPipeline": "my-Pipeline",
                          "targetAction": "Source",
                          "filters": [
                              {
                                  "jsonPath": "$.ref",
                                  "matchEquals": "refs/heads/{Branch}"
                              }
                          ]
                      },
                      "arn": "arn:aws:codepipeline:eu-central-1:123456789012:webhook:my-webhook"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       webhooks -> (list)
          The JSON detail returned for each webhook in the list output for the
          ListWebhooks call.

          (structure)
              The detail returned for each  webhook  after  listing  webhooks,
              such  as the webhook URL, the webhook name, and the webhook ARN.

              definition -> (structure)
                 The detail returned for each webhook,  such  as  the  webhook
                 authentication type and filter rules.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the webhook.

                 targetPipeline -> (string)
                     The  name of the pipeline you want to connect to the web-
                     hook.

                 targetAction -> (string)
                     The name of the action in a pipeline you want to  connect
                     to  the  webhook.  The  action  must  be  from the source
                     (first) stage of the pipeline.

                 filters -> (list)
                     A list of rules applied to the body/payload sent  in  the
                     POST  request  to  a  webhook URL. All defined rules must
                     pass for the request to  be  accepted  and  the  pipeline
                     started.

                     (structure)
                        The event criteria that specify when a webhook notifi-
                        cation is sent to your URL.

                        jsonPath -> (string)
                            A JsonPath  expression  that  is  applied  to  the
                            body/payload of the webhook. The value selected by
                            the JsonPath expression must match the value spec-
                            ified  in  the  MatchEquals  field. Otherwise, the
                            request is ignored. For more information, see Java
                            JsonPath implementation in GitHub.

                        matchEquals -> (string)
                            The value selected by the JsonPath expression must
                            match what is supplied in the  MatchEquals  field.
                            Otherwise, the request is ignored. Properties from
                            the target action configuration can be included as
                            placeholders  in  this  value  by  surrounding the
                            action configuration key with curly brackets.  For
                            example,   if   the   value   supplied   here   is
                            "refs/heads/{Branch}" and the target action has an
                            action configuration property called "Branch" with
                            a value of  "master",  the  MatchEquals  value  is
                            evaluated  as  "refs/heads/master".  For a list of
                            action  configuration  properties   for   built-in
                            action  types,  see  Pipeline  Structure Reference
                            Action Requirements .

                 authentication -> (string)
                     Supported options are GITHUB_HMAC,  IP,  and  UNAUTHENTI-
                     CATED.

                     o For  information about the authentication scheme imple-
                       mented by GITHUB_HMAC, see Securing  your  webhooks  on
                       the GitHub Developer website.

                     o IP rejects webhooks trigger requests unless they origi-
                       nate from an IP address in the IP range whitelisted  in
                       the authentication configuration.

                     o UNAUTHENTICATED  accepts  all  webhook trigger requests
                       regardless of origin.

                 authenticationConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Properties that configure the authentication  applied  to
                     incoming  webhook  trigger requests. The required proper-
                     ties depend on the authentication type. For  GITHUB_HMAC,
                     only  the  SecretToken property must be set. For IP, only
                     the AllowedIPRange property must be set to a  valid  CIDR
                     range. For UNAUTHENTICATED, no properties can be set.

                     AllowedIPRange -> (string)
                        The  property used to configure acceptance of webhooks
                        in  an  IP   address   range.   For   IP,   only   the
                        AllowedIPRange  property  must  be  set. This property
                        must be set to a valid CIDR range.

                     SecretToken -> (string)
                        The property used to configure GitHub  authentication.
                        For GITHUB_HMAC, only the SecretToken property must be
                        set.

              url -> (string)
                 A unique URL generated by CodePipeline. When a  POST  request
                 is  made to this URL, the defined pipeline is started as long
                 as the body of the post request satisfies the defined authen-
                 tication and filtering conditions. Deleting and re-creating a
                 webhook makes the old URL invalid and generates a new one.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The text of the error message about the webhook.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The number code of the error.

              lastTriggered -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a webhook was last successfully  triggered,
                 in timestamp format.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the webhook.

              tags -> (list)
                 Specifies the tags applied to the webhook.

                 (structure)
                     A  tag  is  a  key-value  pair that is used to manage the
                     resource.

                     key -> (string)
                        The tag's key.

                     value -> (string)
                        The tag's value.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the amount of returned information  is  significantly  large,  an
          identifier is also returned and can be used in a subsequent ListWeb-
          hooks call to return the next set of webhooks in the list.
