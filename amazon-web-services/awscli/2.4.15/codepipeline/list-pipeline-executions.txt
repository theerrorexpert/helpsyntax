LIST-PIPELINE-EXECUTIONS()                          LIST-PIPELINE-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-pipeline-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-pipeline-executions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: pipelineExecutionSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-pipeline-executions
          --pipeline-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline for which you want to get execution summary
          information.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              pipelineExecutionId -> (string)
                 The ID of the pipeline execution.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the pipeline execution.

                 o InProgress: The pipeline execution is currently running.

                 o Stopped: The pipeline execution was manually  stopped.  For
                   more information, see Stopped Executions .

                 o Stopping:  The  pipeline execution received a request to be
                   manually stopped. Depending on the selected stop mode,  the
                   execution  is  either  completing or abandoning in-progress
                   actions. For more information, see Stopped Executions .

                 o Succeeded: The pipeline execution  was  completed  success-
                   fully.

                 o Superseded:  While  this pipeline execution was waiting for
                   the next stage to be completed, a newer pipeline  execution
                   advanced  and  continued  through the pipeline instead. For
                   more information, see Superseded Executions .

                 o Failed: The pipeline execution was not  completed  success-
                   fully.

                        Summary  information about the most recent revision of
                        the artifact. For GitHub and AWS CodeCommit  reposito-
                        ries,  the  commit  message.  For Amazon S3 buckets or

                     cution, such as the webhook ARN of the webhook that trig-
                     gered  the  pipeline  execution  or  the  user  ARN for a
