SYNOPSIS
            put-third-party-job-failure-result
          --job-id <value>
          --client-token <value>
          --failure-details <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job that failed. This is the  same  ID  returned  from
          PollForThirdPartyJobs .

       --client-token (string)
          The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to
          verify that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and  its
          details.

       --failure-details (structure)
          Represents information about failure details.

          type -> (string)
              The type of the failure.

          message -> (string)
              The message about the failure.

          externalExecutionId -> (string)
              The external ID of the run of the action that failed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,message=string,externalExecutionId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "JobFailed"|"ConfigurationError"|"PermissionError"|"RevisionOutOfSync"|"RevisionUnavailable"|"SystemUnavailable",
            "message": "string",
            "externalExecutionId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
