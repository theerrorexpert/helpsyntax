SYNOPSIS
            put-approval-result
          --pipeline-name <value>
          --stage-name <value>
          --action-name <value>
          --result <value>
          --token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline that contains the action.

       --stage-name (string)
          The name of the stage that contains the action.

       --action-name (string)
          The name of the action for which approval is requested.

       --result (structure)
          Represents information about the result of the approval request.

          summary -> (string)
              The summary of the current status of the approval request.

          status -> (string)
              The response submitted by a reviewer  assigned  to  an  approval
              action request.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          summary=string,status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "summary": "string",
            "status": "Approved"|"Rejected"
          }

       --token (string)
          The  system-generated  token  used  to  identify  a  unique approval
          request. The token for each open approval request  can  be  obtained
          using  the  GetPipelineState action. It is used to validate that the
          approval request corresponding to this token is still valid.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       approvedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp showing when the approval or rejection was  submitted.
