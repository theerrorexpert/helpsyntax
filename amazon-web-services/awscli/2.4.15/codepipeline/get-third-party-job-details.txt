GET-THIRD-PARTY-JOB-DETAILS()                    GET-THIRD-PARTY-JOB-DETAILS()



NAME
       get-third-party-job-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  the details of a job for a third party action. Used for part-
       ner actions only.

       WARNING:
          When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary  creden-
          tials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if
          the action requires access to that S3 bucket  for  input  or  output
          artifacts.  This  API also returns any secret values defined for the
          action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-third-party-job-details
          --job-id <value>
          --client-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique system-generated ID used for identifying the job.

       --client-token (string)
          The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to
          verify  that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and its
          details.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     the  stage,  and  constrains  the  provider  type for the
                     action. Valid categories are limited to one of  the  fol-
                     lowing values.

                     For  example, an action in the Deploy category type might
                     have a provider of AWS CodeDeploy, which would be  speci-
                     fied  as  CodeDeploy.  For  more  information,  see Valid

                 artifact  store  for the pipeline, such as an AWS Key Manage-
                 ment Service (AWS KMS) key. This is optional and might not be
                 present.

                 id -> (string)
                     The  ID used to identify the key. For an AWS KMS key, you
                     can use the key ID, the key ARN, or the alias ARN.

                     NOTE:
                        Aliases are recognized only in the account  that  cre-
                        ated  the customer master key (CMK). For cross-account
                        actions, you can only use the key ID  or  key  ARN  to
                        identify the key.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of encryption key, such as an AWS Key Management
                     Service (AWS KMS) key. When creating or updating a  pipe-
                     line, the value must be set to 'KMS'.

          nonce -> (string)
              A  system-generated  random number that AWS CodePipeline uses to
              ensure that the job is being worked on by only one  job  worker.
              Use this number in an  AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob request.
