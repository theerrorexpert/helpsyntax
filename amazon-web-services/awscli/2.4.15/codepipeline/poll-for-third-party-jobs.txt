POLL-FOR-THIRD-PARTY-JOBS()                        POLL-FOR-THIRD-PARTY-JOBS()



NAME
       poll-for-third-party-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Determines  whether  there are any third party jobs for a job worker to
       act on. Used for partner actions only.

       WARNING:
          When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary  creden-
          tials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if
          the action requires access to that S3 bucket  for  input  or  output
          artifacts.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            poll-for-third-party-jobs
          --action-type-id <value>
          [--max-batch-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --action-type-id (structure)
          Represents information about an action type.

          category -> (string)
              A  category  defines  what  kind  of  action can be taken in the
              stage, and constrains the provider type for  the  action.  Valid
              categories are limited to one of the following values.

              o Source

              o Build

              o Test

              o Deploy

              o Invoke

              o Approval

          owner -> (string)
              The  creator  of  the action being called. There are three valid
              values for the Owner field in the action category section within
              your  pipeline  structure:  AWS  , ThirdParty , and Custom . For
              more information, see Valid Action Types and Providers in  Code-
              Pipeline .

          provider -> (string)
              The  provider  of  the service being called by the action. Valid
              providers are determined by the action category. For example, an
              action  in the Deploy category type might have a provider of AWS
              CodeDeploy, which would be specified  as  CodeDeploy.  For  more
              information,  see  Valid  Action  Types  and  Providers in Code-
              Pipeline .

          version -> (string)
              A string that describes the action version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          category=string,owner=string,provider=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "category": "Source"|"Build"|"Deploy"|"Test"|"Invoke"|"Approval",
            "owner": "AWS"|"ThirdParty"|"Custom",
            "provider": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --max-batch-size (integer)
          The maximum number of jobs to return in a poll for jobs call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobs -> (list)
          Information about the jobs to take action on.

          (structure)
              A response to a PollForThirdPartyJobs request  returned  by  AWS
              CodePipeline  when  there  is a job to be worked on by a partner
              action.

              clientId -> (string)
                 The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken  pair
                 used  to  verify that the calling entity is allowed access to
                 the job and its details.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The identifier used to identify the job in AWS  CodePipeline.
