LIST-ACTION-TYPES()                                        LIST-ACTION-TYPES()



NAME
       list-action-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  summary  of  all AWS CodePipeline action types associated with
       your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-action-types is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: actionTypes

SYNOPSIS
            list-action-types
          [--action-owner-filter <value>]
          [--region-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --action-owner-filter (string)
          Filters  the  list  of  action types to those created by a specified
          entity.

          Possible values:

          o AWS

          o ThirdParty

          o Custom

       --region-filter (string)
          The Region to filter on for the list of action types.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view the action types available

       Used by itself, the list-action-types command returns the structure  of
       all  actions  available  to  your  AWS  account.  This example uses the
       --action-owner-filter option to return only custom actions.

       Command:

          aws codepipeline list-action-types --action-owner-filter Custom

       Output:

OUTPUT
       actionTypes -> (list)
          Provides details of the action types.

          (structure)
              Returns information about the details of an action type.

              id -> (structure)
                 Represents information about an action type.

                 category -> (string)
                     A category defines what kind of action can  be  taken  in
                     the  stage,  and  constrains  the  provider  type for the
                     action. Valid categories are limited to one of  the  fol-
                     lowing values.

                     o Source

                     o Build

                     o Test

                     o Deploy

                     o Invoke

                     o Approval

                 owner -> (string)
                     The  creator  of the action being called. There are three
                     valid values for the Owner field in the  action  category
                     section  within your pipeline structure: AWS , ThirdParty
                     , and Custom . For more  information,  see  Valid  Action
                     Types and Providers in CodePipeline .

                 provider -> (string)
                     The  provider  of the service being called by the action.
                     Valid providers are determined by  the  action  category.
                     For  example, an action in the Deploy category type might
                     have a provider of AWS CodeDeploy, which would be  speci-
                     fied  as  CodeDeploy.  For  more  information,  see Valid
                     Action Types and Providers in CodePipeline .

                     external service and perform initial configuration of the
                     action provided by that service.

                 entityUrlTemplate -> (string)
                     The URL returned to the  AWS  CodePipeline  console  that
                     provides  a  deep  link  to the resources of the external
                     system, such as the configuration page for an AWS CodeDe-
                     ploy  deployment  group. This link is provided as part of
                     the action display in the pipeline.

                 executionUrlTemplate -> (string)
                     The URL returned to the  AWS  CodePipeline  console  that
                     contains  a  link  to  the top-level landing page for the
                     external system, such as the console page for AWS CodeDe-
                     ploy. This link is shown on the pipeline view page in the
                     AWS CodePipeline console and provides a link to the  exe-
                     cution entity of the external action.

                 revisionUrlTemplate -> (string)
                     The  URL  returned  to  the AWS CodePipeline console that
                     contains a link to the page where customers can update or
                     change the configuration of the external action.

              actionConfigurationProperties -> (list)
                 The configuration properties for the action type.

                 (structure)

                     key -> (boolean)
                        Whether the configuration property is a key.

                     secret -> (boolean)
                        Whether  the configuration property is secret. Secrets
                        are hidden from all calls except for  GetJobDetails  ,
                        GetThirdPartyJobDetails  ,  PollForJobs , and PollFor-
                        ThirdPartyJobs .

                        When updating a pipeline, passing * * *  *  *  without
                        changing  any other values of the action preserves the
                        previous value of the secret.

                     queryable -> (boolean)
                        Indicates that the property is used with PollForJobs .
                        When  creating  a custom action, an action can have up
                        to one queryable property. If it has one,  that  prop-
                        erty must be both required and not secret.

                        If  you  create  a pipeline with a custom action type,
                        and that custom action contains a queryable  property,
                        the  value  for that configuration property is subject
                        to other restrictions. The value must be less than  or
                        equal to twenty (20) characters. The value can contain
                        only   alphanumeric   characters,   underscores,   and
                        hyphens.

                     description -> (string)
                        The  description  of the action configuration property
                        that is displayed to users.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the configuration property.

              inputArtifactDetails -> (structure)
                 The details of the input artifact for the action, such as its
                 commit ID.

                 minimumCount -> (integer)
                     The  minimum  number  of artifacts allowed for the action
                     type.

                 maximumCount -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of artifacts allowed  for  the  action
                     type.

              outputArtifactDetails -> (structure)
                 The details of the output artifact of the action, such as its
                 commit ID.

                 minimumCount -> (integer)
                     The minimum number of artifacts allowed  for  the  action
                     type.

                 maximumCount -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  number  of artifacts allowed for the action
                     type.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the amount of returned information  is  significantly  large,  an
          identifier  is  also  returned.  It can be used in a subsequent list
          action types call to return the next set  of  action  types  in  the
          list.
