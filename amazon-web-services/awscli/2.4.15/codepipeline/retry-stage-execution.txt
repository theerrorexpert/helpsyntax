RETRY-STAGE-EXECUTION()                                RETRY-STAGE-EXECUTION()



NAME
       retry-stage-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Resumes the pipeline execution by retrying the last failed actions in a
       stage. You can retry a stage immediately if any of the actions  in  the
       stage fail. When you retry, all actions that are still in progress con-
       tinue working, and failed actions are triggered again.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            retry-stage-execution
          --pipeline-name <value>
          --stage-name <value>
          --pipeline-execution-id <value>
          --retry-mode <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline that contains the failed stage.

       --stage-name (string)
          The name of the failed stage to be retried.

       --pipeline-execution-id (string)
          The ID of the pipeline execution in the failed stage to be  retried.
          Use the  GetPipelineState action to retrieve the current pipelineEx-
          ecutionId of the failed stage

       --retry-mode (string)
          The scope of the retry attempt. Currently, the only supported  value
          is FAILED_ACTIONS.

          Possible values:

          o FAILED_ACTIONS

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retry a failed action

       The  following retry-stage-execution example retries a stage that has a
       failed action.

          aws codepipeline retry-stage-execution \
              --pipeline-name MyPipeline \
              --stage-name Deploy \
              --pipeline-execution-id b59babff-5f34-EXAMPLE \
              --retry-mode FAILED_ACTIONS

       Output:

          {
              "pipelineExecutionId": "b59babff-5f34-EXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see Retry failed actions (CLI) in the  AWS  Code-
       Pipeline User Guide.

OUTPUT
       pipelineExecutionId -> (string)
          The ID of the current workflow execution in the failed stage.
