START-PIPELINE-EXECUTION()                          START-PIPELINE-EXECUTION()



NAME
       start-pipeline-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the  specified pipeline. Specifically, it begins processing the
       latest commit to the source location specified as part of the pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-pipeline-execution
          --name <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the pipeline to start.

       --client-request-token (string)
          The  system-generated  unique ID used to identify a unique execution
          request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To run the latest revision through a pipeline

       This example runs the latest revision present in the source stage of  a
       pipeline through the pipeline named "MyFirstPipeline".

       Command:

          aws codepipeline start-pipeline-execution --name MyFirstPipeline

       Output:

          {
            "pipelineExecutionId": "3137f7cb-7cf7-EXAMPLE"
          }

OUTPUT
       pipelineExecutionId -> (string)
          The  unique  system-generated  ID of the pipeline execution that was
          started.
