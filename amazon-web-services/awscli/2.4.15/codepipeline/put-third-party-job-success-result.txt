SYNOPSIS
            put-third-party-job-success-result
          --job-id <value>
          --client-token <value>
          [--current-revision <value>]
          [--continuation-token <value>]
          [--execution-details <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job that successfully completed. This is the  same  ID
          returned from PollForThirdPartyJobs .

       --client-token (string)
          The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to
          verify that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and  its
          details.

       --current-revision (structure)
          Represents information about a current revision.

          revision -> (string)
              The revision ID of the current version of an artifact.

          changeIdentifier -> (string)
              The change identifier for the current revision.

          created -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time when the most recent revision of the artifact
              was created, in timestamp format.

          revisionSummary -> (string)
              The summary of the most recent revision of the artifact.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          revision=string,changeIdentifier=string,created=timestamp,revisionSummary=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "revision": "string",
            "changeIdentifier": "string",
            "created": timestamp,
            "revisionSummary": "string"
          }

       --continuation-token (string)
          A token generated by a job worker, such as an AWS CodeDeploy deploy-
          ment ID, that a successful job provides to identify a partner action
          in progress. Future jobs use this  token  to  identify  the  running
          instance  of the action. It can be reused to return more information
          about the progress of the partner action. When the  action  is  com-
          plete, no continuation token should be supplied.

       --execution-details (structure)
          The details of the actions taken and results produced on an artifact
          as it passes through stages in the pipeline.

          summary -> (string)
              The summary of the current status of the actions.

          externalExecutionId -> (string)
              The system-generated unique ID of this action used  to  identify
              this job worker in any external systems, such as AWS CodeDeploy.

          percentComplete -> (integer)
              The percentage of work completed on the action, represented on a
              scale of 0 to 100 percent.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          summary=string,externalExecutionId=string,percentComplete=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "summary": "string",
            "externalExecutionId": "string",
            "percentComplete": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
