NAME
       disable-stage-transition -

DESCRIPTION
       Prevents  artifacts  in a pipeline from transitioning to the next stage
       in the pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-stage-transition
          --pipeline-name <value>
          --stage-name <value>
          --transition-type <value>
          --reason <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline in which you want to disable  the  flow  of
          artifacts from one stage to another.

       --stage-name (string)
          The  name of the stage where you want to disable the inbound or out-
          bound transition of artifacts.

       --transition-type (string)
          Specifies whether artifacts are prevented  from  transitioning  into
          the  stage  and  being  processed  by  the  actions  in  that  stage
          (inbound), or prevented from transitioning from the stage after they
          have been processed by the actions in that stage (outbound).

          Possible values:

          o Inbound

          o Outbound

       --reason (string)
          The reason given to the user that a stage is disabled, such as wait-
          ing for manual approval or manual tests. This message  is  displayed
          in the pipeline console UI.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       This  example  disables transitions into the Beta stage of the MyFirst-
       Pipeline pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.

          aws codepipeline disable-stage-transition --pipeline-name MyFirstPipeline --stage-name Beta  --transition-type Inbound

       Output:

          None.

OUTPUT
       None
