ENABLE-STAGE-TRANSITION()                            ENABLE-STAGE-TRANSITION()



NAME
       enable-stage-transition -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables artifacts in a pipeline to transition to a stage in a pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-stage-transition
          --pipeline-name <value>
          --stage-name <value>
          --transition-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline in which you want to  enable  the  flow  of
          artifacts from one stage to another.

       --stage-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  stage where you want to enable the transition of
          artifacts, either into the stage (inbound) or from that stage to the
          next stage (outbound).

       --transition-type (string)
          Specifies  whether  artifacts  are allowed to enter the stage and be
          processed by the actions in that stage (inbound) or whether  already
          processed  artifacts  are  allowed  to  transition to the next stage
          (outbound).

          Possible values:

          o Inbound

          o Outbound

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable a transition to a stage in a pipeline

       This example enables transitions into the Beta stage  of  the  MyFirst-
       Pipeline pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.

       Command:

          aws codepipeline enable-stage-transition --pipeline-name MyFirstPipeline --stage-name Beta  --transition-type Inbound

       Output:

          None.

OUTPUT
       None
