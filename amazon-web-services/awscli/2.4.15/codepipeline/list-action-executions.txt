LIST-ACTION-EXECUTIONS()                              LIST-ACTION-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-action-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the action executions that have occurred in a pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-action-executions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: actionExecutionDetails

SYNOPSIS
            list-action-executions
          --pipeline-name <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline for which you want to list action execution
          history.

       --filter (structure)
          Input information used to filter action execution history.

          pipelineExecutionId -> (string)
              The  pipeline  execution ID used to filter action execution his-
              tory.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          pipelineExecutionId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "pipelineExecutionId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following  list-action-executions  example  views action execution
       details for a pipeline, such as action execution ID,  input  artifacts,
       output artifacts, execution result, and status.

OUTPUT
       actionExecutionDetails -> (list)
          The details for a list of recent executions, such as  action  execu-
          tion ID.

          (structure)
              Returns  information  about an execution of an action, including
              the action execution ID, and the name, version,  and  timing  of
              the action.

                 Input details for the action execution,  such  as  role  ARN,
                 Region, and input artifacts.

                 actionTypeId -> (structure)
                     Represents information about an action type.

                     category -> (string)
                        A category defines what kind of action can be taken in
                        the stage, and constrains the provider  type  for  the
                        action.  Valid  categories  are  limited to one of the
                        following values.

                        o Source

                        o Build

                        o Test

                        o Deploy

                        o Invoke

                        o Approval

                        The creator of the  action  being  called.  There  are
                        three  valid  values for the Owner field in the action
                        category section within your pipeline structure: AWS ,
                        ThirdParty  ,  and  Custom . For more information, see
                        Valid Action Types and Providers in CodePipeline .

                     provider -> (string)
                        The provider  of  the  service  being  called  by  the
                        action.  Valid  providers are determined by the action
                        category. For example, an action in the  Deploy  cate-
                        gory  type  might  have  a provider of AWS CodeDeploy,
                        which would  be  specified  as  CodeDeploy.  For  more
                        information,  see  Valid Action Types and Providers in
                        CodePipeline .

                 resolvedConfiguration -> (map)
                     Configuration data for an action execution with all vari-
                     able  references  replaced with their real values for the

                 roleArn -> (string)
                     The ARN  of  the  IAM  service  role  that  performs  the
                     declared  action. This is assumed through the roleArn for
                     the pipeline.

                 region -> (string)
                     The AWS Region for the action, such as us-east-1.
