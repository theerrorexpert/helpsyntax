SYNOPSIS
            put-job-success-result
          --job-id <value>
          [--current-revision <value>]
          [--continuation-token <value>]
          [--execution-details <value>]
          [--output-variables <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique system-generated ID of the job that  succeeded.  This  is
          the same ID returned from PollForJobs .

       --current-revision (structure)
          The  ID  of the current revision of the artifact successfully worked
          on by the job.

          revision -> (string)
              The revision ID of the current version of an artifact.

          changeIdentifier -> (string)
              The change identifier for the current revision.

          created -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the most recent revision of the  artifact
              was created, in timestamp format.

          revisionSummary -> (string)
              The summary of the most recent revision of the artifact.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          revision=string,changeIdentifier=string,created=timestamp,revisionSummary=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "revision": "string",
            "changeIdentifier": "string",
            "created": timestamp,
            "revisionSummary": "string"
          }

       --continuation-token (string)
          A token generated by a job worker, such as an AWS CodeDeploy deploy-
          ment ID, that a successful job provides to identify a custom  action
          in  progress.  Future  jobs  use  this token to identify the running
          instance of the action. It can be reused to return more  information
          about  the  progress  of  the custom action. When the action is com-
          plete, no continuation token should be supplied.

       --execution-details (structure)
          The execution details of the successful job,  such  as  the  actions
          taken by the job worker.

          summary -> (string)
              The summary of the current status of the actions.

          externalExecutionId -> (string)
              The  system-generated  unique ID of this action used to identify
              this job worker in any external systems, such as AWS CodeDeploy.

          percentComplete -> (integer)
              The percentage of work completed on the action, represented on a
              scale of 0 to 100 percent.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          summary=string,externalExecutionId=string,percentComplete=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "summary": "string",
            "externalExecutionId": "string",
            "percentComplete": integer
          }

       --output-variables (map)
          Key-value pairs produced as output by a job worker that can be  made
          available  to a downstream action configuration. outputVariables can
          be included only when there is no continuation token on the request.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
