DESCRIBE-STACK-EVENTS()                                DESCRIBE-STACK-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-stack-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  stack  related  events  for  a specified stack in reverse
       chronological order. For more information about a  stack's  event  his-
       tory, go to Stacks in the CloudFormation User Guide.

       NOTE:
          You  can  list  events for stacks that have failed to create or have
          been deleted by specifying the unique stack identifier (stack ID).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-stack-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: StackEvents

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-events
          [--stack-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name  or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack,
          which are not always interchangeable:

          o Running stacks: You can specify either the  stack's  name  or  its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StackEvents -> (list)
          A list of StackEvents structures.

          (structure)
              The StackEvent data type.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The unique ID name of the instance of the stack.

              EventId -> (string)
                 The unique ID of this event.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name associated with a stack.

              LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

              PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The name or unique identifier associated  with  the  physical
                 instance of the resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 Type  of  resource.  (For  more information, go to Amazon Web
                 Services Resource Types Reference in the CloudFormation  User
                 Guide.)

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Time the status was updated.

              ResourceStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the resource.

              ResourceStatusReason -> (string)
                 Success/failure message associated with the resource.

              ResourceProperties -> (string)
                 BLOB of the properties used to create the resource.

              ClientRequestToken -> (string)
                 The  token passed to the operation that generated this event.

                 All events triggered by a given stack operation are  assigned
                 the  same  client  request  token, which you can use to track
                 operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack  opera-
                 tion  with the token token1 , then all the StackEvents gener-
                 ated by that operation will have  ClientRequestToken  set  as
                 token1 .

                 In  the  console, stack operations display the client request
                 token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are  initiated
                 from  the  console  use  the token format Console-StackOpera-
                 tion-ID , which helps you easily identify the stack operation
                 .  For example, if you create a stack using the console, each
                 stack event would be assigned the same token in the following
                 format:                                      Console-CreateS-
                 tack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the output exceeds 1 MB in size, a  string  that  identifies  the
          next  page  of  events.  If no additional page exists, this value is
          null.
