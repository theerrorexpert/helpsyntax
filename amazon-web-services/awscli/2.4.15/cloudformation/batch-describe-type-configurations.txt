SYNOPSIS
            batch-describe-type-configurations
          --type-configuration-identifiers <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-configuration-identifiers (list)
          The list of identifiers for the desired extension configurations.

          (structure)
              Identifying  information  for the configuration of a CloudForma-
              tion extension.

              TypeArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  the  extension,  in  this
                 account and region.

                 For public extensions, this will be the ARN assigned when you
                 activate the type in this account  and  region.  For  private
                 extensions,  this  will be the ARN assigned when you register
                 the type in this account and region.

              TypeConfigurationAlias -> (string)
                 The alias specified for this configuration, if one was speci-
                 fied when the configuration was set.

              TypeConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the configuration, in this
                 account and region.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of extension.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the extension type to  which  this  configuration
                 applies.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TypeArn=string,TypeConfigurationAlias=string,TypeConfigurationArn=string,Type=string,TypeName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TypeArn": "string",
              "TypeConfigurationAlias": "string",
              "TypeConfigurationArn": "string",
              "Type": "RESOURCE"|"MODULE",
              "TypeName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To batch describe a type configuration

       The following batch-describe-type-configurations example configures the
       data for the type.

          aws cloudformation batch-describe-type-configurations \
              --region us-west-2 \
              --type-configuration-identifiers TypeArn="arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/Example-Test-Type,TypeConfigurationAlias=MyConfiguration"
