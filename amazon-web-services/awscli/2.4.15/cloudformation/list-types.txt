LIST-TYPES()                                                      LIST-TYPES()



NAME
       list-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about extension that have been registered
       with CloudFormation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-types is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: TypeSummaries

OPTIONS
       --visibility (string)
          The  scope  at which the extensions are visible and usable in Cloud-
          Formation operations.

          Valid values include:

          o PRIVATE : Extensions that  are  visible  and  usable  within  this
            account and region. This includes:

            o Private  extensions  you  have  registered  in  this account and
              region.

            o Public extensions that you have activated in  this  account  and
              region.

          o PUBLIC  : Extensions that are publicly visible and available to be
            activated within any Amazon account. This includes extensions from
            Amazon, as well as third-party publishers.

          The default is PRIVATE .

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o PRIVATE

       --provisioning-type (string)
          For  resource types, the provisioning behavior of the resource type.
          CloudFormation determines the provisioning type during registration,
          based on the types of handlers in the schema handler package submit-
          ted.

          Valid values include:

          o FULLY_MUTABLE : The resource type includes an  update  handler  to
            process updates to the type during stack update operations.

          o IMMUTABLE  : The resource type does not include an update handler,
            so the type cannot be updated and must instead be replaced  during
            stack update operations.

          o NON_PROVISIONABLE  :  The  resource  type does not include create,
            read, and delete handlers, and therefore cannot actually be provi-
            sioned.

          The default is FULLY_MUTABLE .

          Possible values:

          o NON_PROVISIONABLE

          o IMMUTABLE

          o FULLY_MUTABLE

       --deprecated-status (string)
          The deprecation status of the extension that you want to get summary
          information about.

          Valid values include:

          o LIVE : The extension is registered for use in CloudFormation oper-
            ations.

          o DEPRECATED : The extension has been deregistered and can no longer
            be used in CloudFormation operations.

          Possible values:

          o LIVE

          o DEPRECATED

       --type (string)
          The type of extension.

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

       --filters (structure)
          Filter criteria to use in determining which extensions to return.

          Filters must be compatible with Visibility to return valid  results.
          For example, specifying AWS_TYPES for Category and PRIVATE for Visi-
          bility returns an empty list of types,  but  specifying  PUBLIC  for
          Visibility returns the desired list.

          Category -> (string)
              The category of extensions to return.

              o REGISTERED  : Private extensions that have been registered for
                this account and region.

              o ACTIVATED : Public extensions that  have  been  activated  for
                this account and region.

              o THIRD_PARTY  :  Extensions  available  for use from publishers
                other than Amazon. This includes:

                o Private extensions registered in the account.

                o Public extensions from publishers other than Amazon, whether
                  activated or not.

              o AWS_TYPES : Extensions available for use from Amazon.

          PublisherId -> (string)
              The id of the publisher of the extension.

              Extensions  published by Amazon are not assigned a publisher ID.
              Use the AWS_TYPE category to specify a list of  types  published
              by Amazon.

          TypeNamePrefix -> (string)
              A prefix to use as a filter for results.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Category=string,PublisherId=string,TypeNamePrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Category": "REGISTERED"|"ACTIVATED"|"THIRD_PARTY"|"AWS_TYPES",
            "PublisherId": "string",
            "TypeNamePrefix": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TypeSummaries -> (list)
          A list of TypeSummary structures that contain information about  the
          specified extensions.

          (structure)
              Contains  summary information about the specified CloudFormation
              extension.

              Type -> (string)
                 The kind of extension.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the extension.

                 If you specified  a  TypeNameAlias  when  you  activate  this
                 extension  in your account and region, CloudFormation consid-
                 ers that alias as the type name.

              DefaultVersionId -> (string)
                 The ID of the default version of the extension.  The  default
                 version  is used when the extension version is not specified.

                 This applies only to private extensions you  have  registered
                 in  your  account. For public extensions, both those provided
                 by Amazon and  published  by  third  parties,  CloudFormation
                 returns null . For more information, see RegisterType .

                 To  set the default version of an extension, use ``  SetType-
                 DefaultVersion `` .

              TypeArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 When the specified extension  version  was  registered.  This
                 applies only to:

                 o Private extensions you have registered in your account. For
                   more information, see RegisterType .

                 o Public extensions you have activated in your  account  with
                   auto-update    specified.   For   more   information,   see
                   ActivateType .

                 For all other extension types, CloudFormation returns null  .

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the extension.

              PublisherId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the extension publisher, if the extension is pub-
                 lished by a third party. Extensions published  by  Amazon  do
                 not return a publisher ID.

              OriginalTypeName -> (string)
                 For  public  extensions  that  have  been  activated for this
                 account and region, the type name of the public extension.

                 If you specified a TypeNameAlias when enabling the  extension
                 in  this account and region, CloudFormation treats that alias
                 as the extension's type name within the account  and  region,
                 not  the type name of the public extension. For more informa-
                 tion, see Specifying aliases to refer to  extensions  in  the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              PublicVersionNumber -> (string)
                 For  public  extensions  that  have  been  activated for this
                 account and region, the version of the public extension to be
                 used  for  CloudFormation  operations  in  this  account  and
                 region.

                 How you specified  AutoUpdate  when  enabling  the  extension
                 affects  whether  CloudFormation  automatically  updates  the
                 extention in this account and region when a  new  version  is
                 released. For more information, see Setting CloudFormation to
                 automatically use new versions of extensions in the CloudFor-
                 mation User Guide .

              LatestPublicVersion -> (string)
                 For  public  extensions  that  have  been  activated for this
                 account and region, the latest version of the  public  exten-
                 sion  that is available . For any extensions other than acti-
                 vated third-arty extensions, CloudFormation returns null .

                 How you specified  AutoUpdate  when  enabling  the  extension
                 affects  whether  CloudFormation  automatically  updates  the
                 extention in this account and region when a  new  version  is
                 released. For more information, see Setting CloudFormation to
                 automatically use new versions of extensions in the CloudFor-
                 mation User Guide .

              PublisherIdentity -> (string)
                 The service used to verify the publisher identity.

                 For more information, see Registering your account to publish
                 CloudFormation extensions  in  the  CFN-CLI  User  Guide  for
                 Extension Development .

              PublisherName -> (string)
                 The publisher name, as defined in the public profile for that
                 publisher in the service used to verify the  publisher  iden-
                 tity.

              IsActivated -> (boolean)
                 Whether  or  not  the extension is activated for this account
                 and region.

                 This applies only to third-party  public  extensions.  Exten-
                 sions published by Amazon are activated by default.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the request doesn't return all of the remaining results, NextTo-
          ken is set to a token. To retrieve the next  set  of  results,  call
          this  action  again  and  assign  that token to the request object's
          NextToken parameter. If the request returns all  results,  NextToken
          is set to null .



                                                                  LIST-TYPES()
