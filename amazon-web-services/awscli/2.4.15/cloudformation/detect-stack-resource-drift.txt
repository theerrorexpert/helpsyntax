DETECT-STACK-RESOURCE-DRIFT()                    DETECT-STACK-RESOURCE-DRIFT()



NAME
       detect-stack-resource-drift -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  whether  a resource's actual configuration
       differs, or has drifted , from it's expected configuration, as  defined
       in  the stack template and any values specified as template parameters.
       This information includes  actual  and  expected  property  values  for
       resources  in which CloudFormation detects drift. Only resource proper-
       ties explicitly defined in the stack template are  checked  for  drift.
       For  more  information  about  stack  and resource drift, see Detecting
       Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

       Use DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on  individual  resources,
       or   DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all resources in a given stack
       that support drift detection.

       Resources that do not  currently  support  drift  detection  cannot  be
       checked.  For  a  list  of  resources that support drift detection, see
       Resources that Support Drift Detection .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-stack-resource-drift
          --stack-name <value>
          --logical-resource-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack to which the resource belongs.

       --logical-resource-id (string)
          The logical name of the resource for which to return drift  informa-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detect drift for a resource

       The  following  detect-stack-resource-drift  example  checks a resource
       named MyFunction in a stack named MyStack for drift:

          aws cloudformation detect-stack-resource-drift \
             --stack-name MyStack \
             --logical-resource-id MyFunction

       The output shows an AWS Lambda function that was modified out-of-band:

OUTPUT
       StackResourceDrift -> (structure)
          Information about whether the resource's  actual  configuration  has
          drifted  from  its expected template configuration, including actual
          and expected property values and any differences detected.

          StackId -> (string)
              The ID of the stack.

          LogicalResourceId -> (string)
              The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

          PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
              The name or unique identifier that  corresponds  to  a  physical
              instance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.

          PhysicalResourceIdContext -> (list)
              Context  information  that  enables  CloudFormation  to uniquely
              identify a resource. CloudFormation uses context key-value pairs
              in  cases  where  a  resource's logical and physical IDs are not
              enough  to  uniquely  identify  that  resource.   Each   context
              key-value  pair  specifies  a  unique resource that contains the
              targeted resource.

              (structure)
                 Context information that enables CloudFormation  to  uniquely
                 identify  a  resource.  CloudFormation uses context key-value
                 pairs in cases where a resource's logical  and  physical  IDs
                 are  not enough to uniquely identify that resource. Each con-
                 text key-value pair specifies a resource  that  contains  the
                 targeted resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The resource context key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The resource context value.

          ResourceType -> (string)
              The type of the resource.

          ExpectedProperties -> (string)
              A  JSON structure containing the expected property values of the
              stack resource, as defined in the stack template and any  values
              specified as template parameters.

              For  resources  whose StackResourceDriftStatus is DELETED , this
              structure will not be present.

          ActualProperties -> (string)
              A JSON structure containing the actual property  values  of  the
              stack resource.

              For  resources  whose StackResourceDriftStatus is DELETED , this
              structure will not be present.

          PropertyDifferences -> (list)
              A collection of the resource properties whose actual values dif-
              fer  from  their expected values. These will be present only for
              resources whose StackResourceDriftStatus is MODIFIED .

              (structure)
                 Information about a resource property whose actual value dif-
                 fers  from  its  expected value, as defined in the stack tem-
                 plate and any values specified as template parameters.  These
                 will  be present only for resources whose StackResourceDrift-
                 Status is MODIFIED .  For  more  information,  see  Detecting
                 Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

                 ExpectedValue -> (string)
                     The  expected property value of the resource property, as
                     defined in the stack template and any values specified as
                     template parameters.

                 ActualValue -> (string)

                     o ADD  :  A  value  has been added to a resource property
                       that is an array or list data type.

                     o REMOVE : The property has been removed from the current
                       resource configuration.

                     o NOT_EQUAL : The current property value differs from its
                       expected value (as defined in the  stack  template  and
                       any values specified as template parameters).

          StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
              Status  of  the  resource's actual configuration compared to its
              expected configuration

              o DELETED : The resource differs from its expected template con-
                figuration because the resource has been deleted.

              o MODIFIED  :  One or more resource properties differ from their
                expected values (as defined in the stack template and any val-
                ues specified as template parameters).

              o IN_SYNC  :  The  resources's  actual configuration matches its
                expected template configuration.

                value.

          Timestamp -> (timestamp)
              Time  at  which  CloudFormation performed drift detection on the
              stack resource.

          ModuleInfo -> (structure)
              Contains information about the module from  which  the  resource
              was  created, if the resource was created from a module included
              in the stack template.

              TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                 A concantenated list of the the module type or types contain-
                 ing  the  resource. Module types are listed starting with the
                 inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                 In the following example, the resource  was  created  from  a
                 module  of  type AWS::First::Example::MODULE , that is nested
                 inside a parent module of type AWS::Second::Example::MODULE .
                     AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MODULE

              LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                 A concantenated list of the logical IDs of the module or mod-
                 ules containing the resource.  Modules  are  listed  starting
                 with the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                 In  the  following  example,  the resource was created from a
                 module, moduleA , that is nested inside a parent module, mod-
                 uleB .
                     moduleA/moduleB
