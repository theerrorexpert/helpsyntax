DESCRIBE-TYPE()                                                DESCRIBE-TYPE()



NAME
       describe-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed  information  about an extension that has been regis-
       tered.

       If you specify a VersionId ,  DescribeType  returns  information  about
       that  specific  extension  version.  Otherwise,  it returns information
       about the default extension version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-type
          [--type <value>]
          [--type-name <value>]
          [--arn <value>]
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--publisher-id <value>]
          [--public-version-number <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The kind of extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

       --type-name (string)
          The name of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --version-id (string)
          The ID of a specific version of the extension. The version ID is the
          value  at  the end of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) assigned to the
          extension version when it is registered.

          If you specify a VersionId , DescribeType returns information  about
          that  specific  extension version. Otherwise, it returns information
          about the default extension version.

       --publisher-id (string)
          The publisher ID of the extension publisher.

          Extensions provided by Amazon are not assigned a publisher ID.

       --public-version-number (string)
          The version number of a public third-party extension.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

       Type -> (string)
          The kind of extension.

       TypeName -> (string)
          The name of the extension.

          If the extension is a public third-party  type  you  have  activated
          with  a type name alias, CloudFormation returns the type name alias.
          For more information, see ActivateType .

       DefaultVersionId -> (string)
          The ID of the default version of the extension. The default  version
          is used when the extension version is not specified.

          This  applies only to private extensions you have registered in your
          account. For public extensions, both those provided  by  Amazon  and
          published  by  third parties, CloudFormation returns null . For more
          information, see RegisterType .

          To set the default version of an extension, use ``   SetTypeDefault-
          Version `` .

       IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
          Whether  the  specified extension version is set as the default ver-
          sion.

          This applies only to private extensions you have registered in  your
          account,  and extensions published by Amazon. For public third-party
          extensions, whether or not  they  are  activated  in  your  account,
          CloudFormation returns null .

       TypeTestsStatus -> (string)
          The  contract  test  status  of the registered extension version. To
          return the extension test status of a specifc extension version, you
          must specify VersionId .

          This  applies  only to registered private extension versions. Cloud-
          Formation does not return this information  for  public  extensions,
          whether or not they are activated in your account.

          o PASSED  :  The  extension  has  passed  all its contract tests. An
            extension must have a test status of PASSED before it can be  pub-
            lished.  For  more  information, see Publishing extensions to make
            them available for public use in the CloudFormation  Command  Line
            Interface User Guide .

          o FAILED : The extension has failed one or more contract tests.

          o IN_PROGRESS  : Contract tests are currently being performed on the
            extension.

          o NOT_TESTED : Contract tests have not been performed on the  exten-
            sion.

       TypeTestsStatusDescription -> (string)
          The  description  of  the  test status. To return the extension test
          status of a specifc extension version, you must specify VersionId  .

          This  applies  only to registered private extension versions. Cloud-
          Formation does not return this information  for  public  extensions,
          whether or not they are activated in your account.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the extension.

       Schema -> (string)
          The schema that defines the extension.

          For  more  information  on  extension schemas, see Resource Provider
          Schema in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

       ProvisioningType -> (string)
          For resource type  extensions,  the  provisioning  behavior  of  the
          resource  type. CloudFormation determines the provisioning type dur-
          ing registration, based on the types of handlers in the schema  han-
          dler package submitted.

          Valid values include:

          o FULLY_MUTABLE  :  The  resource type includes an update handler to
            process updates to the type during stack update operations.

          o IMMUTABLE : The resource type does not include an update  handler,
            so  the type cannot be updated and must instead be replaced during
            stack update operations.

          o NON_PROVISIONABLE : The resource type does not include all of  the
            following  handlers, and therefore cannot actually be provisioned.

            o create

            o read

            o delete

       DeprecatedStatus -> (string)
          The deprecation status of the extension version.

          Valid values include:

          o LIVE : The extension is activated or registered and can be used in
            CloudFormation  operations, dependent on its provisioning behavior
            and visibility scope.

          o DEPRECATED : The extension has been  deactivated  or  deregistered
            and can no longer be used in CloudFormation operations.

          For public third-party extensions, CloudFormation returns null .

       LoggingConfig -> (structure)
          Contains  logging  configuration information for private extensions.
          This applies only to private extensions you have registered in  your
          account.  For  public  extensions, both those provided by Amazon and
          published by third parties, CloudFormation returns null .  For  more
          information, see RegisterType .

          LogRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role that CloudFormation should assume when send-
              ing log entries to CloudWatch logs.

          LogGroupName -> (string)
              The Amazon CloudWatch log group to  which  CloudFormation  sends
              error  logging  information  when  invoking the extension's han-
              dlers.

       RequiredActivatedTypes -> (list)
          For extensions that are modules, the public  third-party  extensions
          that  must  be  activated  in  your  account in order for the module
          itself to be activated.

          (structure)
              For extensions that are modules, a public third-party  extension
              that  must  be activated in your account in order for the module
              itself to be activated.

              For more information, see Activating public modules for  use  in
              your account in the CloudFormation User Guide .

              TypeNameAlias -> (string)
                 An  alias  assigned  to the public extension, in this account
                 and region. If you specify an alias for the extension, Cloud-
                 Formation  treats the alias as the extension type name within
                 this account and region. You must use the alias to  refer  to
                 the  extension  in your templates, API calls, and CloudForma-
                 tion console.

              OriginalTypeName -> (string)
                 The type name of the public extension.

                 If you specified a TypeNameAlias when enabling the  extension
                 in  this account and region, CloudFormation treats that alias
                 as the extension's type name within the account  and  region,
                 not  the type name of the public extension. For more informa-
                 tion, see Specifying aliases to refer to  extensions  in  the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              PublisherId -> (string)
                 The publisher ID of the extension publisher.

              SupportedMajorVersions -> (list)
                 A  list  of the major versions of the extension type that the
                 macro supports.

                 (integer)

       ExecutionRoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  execution  role  used  to
          register  the extension. This applies only to private extensions you
          have  registered  in  your  account.  For  more   information,   see
          RegisterType .

          If  the registered extension calls any Amazon Web Services APIs, you
          must create an * IAM execution role * that  includes  the  necessary
          permissions  to  call  those Amazon Web Services APIs, and provision
          that execution role in your  account.  CloudFormation  then  assumes
          that  execution  role to provide your extension with the appropriate
          credentials.

       Visibility -> (string)
          The scope at which the extension is visible and usable in  CloudFor-
          mation operations.

          Valid values include:

          o PRIVATE  :  The  extension  is  only visible and usable within the
            account in which it is registered. CloudFormation marks any exten-
            sions you register as PRIVATE .

          o PUBLIC : The extension is publically visible and usable within any
            Amazon account.

       SourceUrl -> (string)
          The URL of the source code for the extension.

       DocumentationUrl -> (string)
          The URL of a page providing detailed documentation for  this  exten-
          sion.

       LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
          When  the  specified  extension version was registered. This applies
          only to:

          o Private extensions you have registered in your account.  For  more
            information, see RegisterType .

          o Public   extensions  you  have  activated  in  your  account  with
            auto-update specified. For more information, see ActivateType .

       TimeCreated -> (timestamp)
          When the specified private extension version was registered or acti-
          vated in your account.

       ConfigurationSchema -> (string)
          A  JSON string that represent the current configuration data for the
          extension in this account and region.

          To   set   the   configuration   data   for   an   extension,    use
          SetTypeConfiguration  . For more information, see Configuring exten-
          sions at the account level in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       PublisherId -> (string)
          The publisher ID of the extension publisher.

          This applies only to public third-party extensions. For private reg-
          istered  extensions,  and extensions provided by Amazon, CloudForma-
          tion returns null .

       OriginalTypeName -> (string)
          For public extensions that have been activated for this account  and
          region, the type name of the public extension.

          If you specified a TypeNameAlias when enabling the extension in this
          account and region, CloudFormation treats that alias as  the  exten-
          sion's type name within the account and region, not the type name of
          the public extension. For more information, see  Specifying  aliases
          to refer to extensions in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       OriginalTypeArn -> (string)
          For  public extensions that have been activated for this account and
          region, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the public extension.

       PublicVersionNumber -> (string)
          The version number of a public third-party extension.

          This applies only if you specify a public extension you  have  acti-
          vated  in your account, or specify a public extension without speci-
          fying a version. For all other  extensions,  CloudFormation  returns
          null .

       LatestPublicVersion -> (string)
          The  latest version of a public extension that is available for use.

          This only applies if you specify a public extension, and you do  not
          specify  a  version.  For all other requests, CloudFormation returns
          null .

       IsActivated -> (boolean)
          Whether or not the extension is activated in the account and region.

          This  only  applies  to public third-party extensions. For all other
          extensions, CloudFormation returns null .

       AutoUpdate -> (boolean)
          Whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extension  in  this
          account  and  region  when  a  new minor version is published by the
          extension publisher. Major versions released by the  publisher  must
          be  manually  updated.  For  more information, see Activating public
          extensions for use in your account in the CloudFormation User  Guide
          .
