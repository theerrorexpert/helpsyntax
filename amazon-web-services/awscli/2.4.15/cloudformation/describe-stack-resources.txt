DESCRIBE-STACK-RESOURCES()                          DESCRIBE-STACK-RESOURCES()



NAME
       describe-stack-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  Amazon  Web  Services  resource  descriptions  for running and
       deleted stacks. If StackName is specified, all the associated resources
       that are part of the stack are returned. If PhysicalResourceId is spec-
       ified, the associated resources of the stack that the resource  belongs
       to are returned.

       NOTE:
          Only  the  first  100  resources will be returned. If your stack has
          more resources than this, you should use ListStackResources instead.

       For deleted stacks, DescribeStackResources returns resource information
       for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

       You must specify either StackName or PhysicalResourceId , but not both.
       In  addition,  you can specify LogicalResourceId to filter the returned
       result. For more information about resources, the LogicalResourceId and
       PhysicalResourceId , go to the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NOTE:
          A  ValidationError  is  returned  if  you specify both StackName and
          PhysicalResourceId in the same request.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-resources
          [--stack-name <value>]
          [--logical-resource-id <value>]
          [--physical-resource-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with  the  stack,
          which are not always interchangeable:

          o Running  stacks:  You  can  specify either the stack's name or its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

          Required: Conditional. If you do not specify StackName  ,  you  must
          specify PhysicalResourceId .

       --logical-resource-id (string)
          The logical name of the resource as specified in the template.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --physical-resource-id (string)
          The  name  or  unique  identifier  that  corresponds  to  a physical
          instance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.

          For example, for an Amazon Elastic  Compute  Cloud  (EC2)  instance,
          PhysicalResourceId  corresponds to the InstanceId . You can pass the
          EC2 InstanceId to DescribeStackResources to  find  which  stack  the
          instance  belongs to and what other resources are part of the stack.

          Required: Conditional. If you do not  specify  PhysicalResourceId  ,
          you must specify StackName .

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 differs, or has drifted , from its expected configuration, as
                 defined  in  the  stack  template and any values specified as
                 template parameters.  For  more  information,  see  Detecting

                       resource  differs  from its expected configuration. Any
                       resources that do not currently support drift detection
                       have  a  status  of NOT_CHECKED . For more information,
                       see Resources that Support Drift Detection .

              ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the module from which the resource
                 was  created,  if  the  resource  was  created  from a module
                 included in the stack template.

                 TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                     A concantenated list of the the module type or types con-
                     taining  the  resource.  Module types are listed starting
                     with the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module  of  type  AWS::First::Example::MODULE  ,  that is
                     nested inside a parent module of type  AWS::Second::Exam-
                     ple::MODULE .
                        AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MOD-

                     A concantenated list of the logical IDs of the module  or
                     modules  containing  the  resource.  Modules  are  listed
                     starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated
                     by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module, moduleA , that is nested inside a parent  module,
                     moduleB .
                        moduleA/moduleB
