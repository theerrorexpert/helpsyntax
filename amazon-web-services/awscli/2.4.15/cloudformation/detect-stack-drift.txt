DETECT-STACK-DRIFT()                                      DETECT-STACK-DRIFT()



NAME
       detect-stack-drift -

DESCRIPTION
       Detects  whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has drifted
       , from it's expected configuration, as defined in  the  stack  template
       and  any  values specified as template parameters. For each resource in
       the stack that supports drift detection,  CloudFormation  compares  the
       actual configuration of the resource with its expected template config-
       uration. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack  tem-
       plate  are  checked for drift. A stack is considered to have drifted if
       one or more of its resources differ from their expected  template  con-
       figurations. For more information, see Detecting Unregulated Configura-
       tion Changes to Stacks and Resources .

       Use DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all supported resources  for  a
       given stack, or  DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual
       resources.

       For a list of stack resources that currently support  drift  detection,
       see Resources that Support Drift Detection .
          DetectStackDrift  can  take  up to several minutes, depending on the
          number of resources contained within the stack. Use   DescribeStack-
          DriftDetectionStatus to monitor the progress of a detect stack drift
          operation. Once the drift detection  operation  has  completed,  use
          DescribeStackResourceDrifts  to  return  drift information about the
          stack and its resources.

       When detecting drift on a stack, CloudFormation does not  detect  drift
       on  any nested stacks belonging to that stack. Perform DetectStackDrift
       directly on the nested stack itself.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-stack-drift
          --stack-name <value>
          [--logical-resource-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack for which you want to detect drift.

       --logical-resource-ids (list)
          The logical names of any resources you want to use as filters.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detect drifted resources

       The following detect-stack-drift example initiates drift detection  for
       the specified stack.

          aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift \
              --stack-name my-stack

       Output:

          {
              "StackDriftDetectionId": "1a229160-e4d9-xmpl-ab67-0a4f93df83d4"
          }

       You  can  then use this ID with the describe-stack-resource-drifts com-
       mand to describe drifted resources.

OUTPUT
       StackDriftDetectionId -> (string)
          The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

          CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID,
          each  time  this  operation  is  run.  However,  the number of drift
          results CloudFormation retains for any  given  stack,  and  for  how
          long, may vary.
