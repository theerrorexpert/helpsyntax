LIST-STACKS()                                                    LIST-STACKS()



NAME
       list-stacks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  summary  information  for stacks whose status matches the
       specified StackStatusFilter. Summary information for stacks  that  have
       been  deleted  is  kept  for  90 days after the stack is deleted. If no
       StackStatusFilter is specified, summary information for all  stacks  is
       returned (including existing stacks and stacks that have been deleted).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stacks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: StackSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-stacks
          [--stack-status-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-status-filter (list)
          Stack  status  to  use as a filter. Specify one or more stack status
          codes to list only stacks with the specified  status  codes.  For  a
          complete  list  of stack status codes, see the StackStatus parameter
          of the  Stack data type.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
            CREATE_FAILED
            CREATE_COMPLETE
            ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS
            ROLLBACK_FAILED
            ROLLBACK_COMPLETE
            DELETE_IN_PROGRESS
            DELETE_FAILED
            DELETE_COMPLETE
            UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS
            UPDATE_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS
            UPDATE_COMPLETE
            UPDATE_FAILED
            UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS
            UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED
            UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS
            UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE
            REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS
            IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS
            IMPORT_COMPLETE
            IMPORT_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS
            IMPORT_ROLLBACK_FAILED
            IMPORT_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list AWS CloudFormation stacks

       The following list-stacks command shows a summary of  all  stacks  that
       have a status of CREATE_COMPLETE:

          aws cloudformation list-stacks --stack-status-filter CREATE_COMPLETE

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/myteststack/466df9e0-0dff-08e3-8e2f-5088487c4896",
                  "TemplateDescription": "AWS CloudFormation Sample Template S3_Bucket: Sample template showing how to create a publicly accessible S3 bucket. **WARNING** This template creates an S3 bucket. You will be billed for the AWS resources used if you create a stack from this template.",
                  "StackStatusReason": null,
                  "CreationTime": "2013-08-26T03:27:10.190Z",
                  "StackName": "myteststack",
                  "StackStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE"
              }
          ]

OUTPUT
       StackSummaries -> (list)

              The StackSummary Data Type

              StackId -> (string)
                 Unique stack identifier.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name associated with the stack.

              TemplateDescription -> (string)

                 stack.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the stack was created.

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time the stack was last updated. This field will only be
                 returned if the stack has been updated at least once.

              DeletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the stack was deleted.

              StackStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the stack.

              StackStatusReason -> (string)
                 Success/Failure message associated with the stack status.

              ParentId -> (string)
                 For nested stacks--stacks created as  resources  for  another
                 stack--the  stack  ID of the direct parent of this stack. For
                 the first level of nested stacks, the root stack is also  the
                 parent stack.

                 For  more  information, see Working with Nested Stacks in the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              RootId -> (string)
                 For nested stacks--stacks created as  resources  for  another
                 stack--the  stack  ID  of  the  top-level  stack to which the
                 nested stack ultimately belongs.

                 For more information, see Working with Nested Stacks  in  the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              DriftInformation -> (structure)
                 Summarizes information on whether a stack's actual configura-
                 tion differs, or has drifted , from it's expected  configura-
                 tion,  as defined in the stack template and any values speci-
                 fied  as  template  parameters.  For  more  information,  see
                 Detecting  Unregulated  Configuration  Changes  to Stacks and

                 StackDriftStatus -> (string)
                     Status of the stack's actual  configuration  compared  to
                     its expected template configuration.

                     o DRIFTED  : The stack differs from its expected template
                       configuration. A stack is considered to have drifted if
                       one or more of its resources have drifted.

                     o NOT_CHECKED  :  CloudFormation  has  not checked if the
                       stack differs from its expected template configuration.

                     o IN_SYNC  : The stack's actual configuration matches its
                       expected template configuration.

                 LastCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     Most recent time when a  drift  detection  operation  was
                     initiated   on  the  stack,  or  any  of  its  individual
                     resources that support drift detection.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the output exceeds 1 MB in size, a  string  that  identifies  the
          next  page  of  stacks.  If no additional page exists, this value is
          null.
