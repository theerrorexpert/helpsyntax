LIST-STACK-RESOURCES()                                  LIST-STACK-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-stack-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns descriptions of all resources of the specified stack.

       For deleted stacks, ListStackResources returns resource information for
       up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stack-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: StackResourceSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-stack-resources
          --stack-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name  or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack,
          which are not always interchangeable:

          o Running stacks: You can specify either the  stack's  name  or  its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following  command displays the list of resources in the specified
       stack.

OUTPUT
       StackResourceSummaries -> (list)
          A list of StackResourceSummary structures.

          (structure)
              Contains  high-level  information  about  the  specified   stack
              resource.

              LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

              PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The  name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical
                 instance ID of the resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 Type of resource. (For more information,  go  to  Amazon  Web
                 Services  Resource Types Reference in the CloudFormation User
                 Guide.)

              LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Time the status was updated.

              ResourceStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the resource.

              ResourceStatusReason -> (string)
                 Success/failure message associated with the resource.

              DriftInformation -> (structure)
                 Information about whether the resource's actual configuration
                 differs, or has drifted , from its expected configuration, as
                 defined in the stack template and  any  values  specified  as
                 template  parameters.  For  more  information,  see Detecting
                 Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

                 StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
                     Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to
                     its expected configuration

                     o DELETED  :  The resource differs from its expected con-
                       figuration in that it has been deleted.

                     o MODIFIED : The resource differs from its expected  con-
                       figuration.

                     o NOT_CHECKED  :  CloudFormation  has  not checked if the
                       resource differs from its expected  configuration.  Any
                       resources that do not currently support drift detection
                       have a status of NOT_CHECKED .  For  more  information,
                       see  Resources  that  Support  Drift Detection . If you
                       performed an   ContinueUpdateRollback  operation  on  a
                       stack,  any  resources included in ResourcesToSkip will
                       also have a status of NOT_CHECKED . For  more  informa-
                       tion  on skipping resources during rollback operations,
                       see Continue Rolling Back an Update in the  CloudForma-
                       tion User Guide.

                     o IN_SYNC  : The resources's actual configuration matches
                       its expected configuration.

                 LastCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     When CloudFormation last  checked  if  the  resource  had
                     drifted from its expected configuration.

              ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the module from which the resource
                 was created, if  the  resource  was  created  from  a  module
                 included in the stack template.

                 TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                     A concantenated list of the the module type or types con-
                     taining the resource. Module types  are  listed  starting
                     with the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module of  type  AWS::First::Example::MODULE  ,  that  is
                     nested  inside a parent module of type AWS::Second::Exam-
                     ple::MODULE .
                        AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MOD-
                        ULE

                 LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                     A  concantenated list of the logical IDs of the module or
                     modules  containing  the  resource.  Modules  are  listed
                     starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated
                     by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module,  moduleA , that is nested inside a parent module,
                     moduleB .
                        moduleA/moduleB

                     For more information, see Referencing resources in a mod-
                     ule in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  output exceeds 1 MB, a string that identifies the next page
          of stack resources. If no additional  page  exists,  this  value  is
          null.
