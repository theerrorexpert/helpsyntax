LIST-STACK-INSTANCES()                                  LIST-STACK-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-stack-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about stack instances that are associated
       with the specified stack set. You can filter for stack  instances  that
       are  associated  with  a  specific  Amazon Web Services account name or
       Region, or that have a specific status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stack-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Summaries

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  or unique ID of the stack set that you want to list stack
          instances for.

       --filters (list)
          The status that stack instances are filtered by.

          (structure)
              The status that stack instances are filtered by.

              Name -> (string)
                 The type of filter to apply.

              Values -> (string)
                 The status to filter by.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "DETAILED_STATUS",
              "Values": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --stack-instance-account (string)
          The name of the Amazon Web Services account that you  want  to  list
          stack instances for.

       --stack-instance-region (string)
          The name of the Region where you want to list stack instances.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

          about the specified stack instances.

          (structure)
              The structure that contains summary information  about  a  stack
              instance.

              StackSetId -> (string)
                 The  name  or  unique  ID  of  the  stack  set that the stack
                 instance is associated with.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services  Region  that  the  stack
                 instance is associated with.

              Account -> (string)
                 [Self-managed  permissions]  The  name of the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices account that the stack instance is associated with.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack instance.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the stack instance, in terms  of  its  synchro-
                 nization with its associated stack set.

                 o INOPERABLE  :  A  DeleteStackInstances operation has failed
                   and left the stack in an unstable  state.  Stacks  in  this
                   state  are excluded from further UpdateStackSet operations.
                   You might need to perform a DeleteStackInstances operation,
                   with  RetainStacks  set  to  true  ,  to  delete  the stack
                   instance, and then delete the stack manually.

                 o OUTDATED : The stack isn't currently up to  date  with  the
                   stack set because:

                   o The  associated  stack  failed during a CreateStackSet or
                     UpdateStackSet operation.

                   o The stack was part of a CreateStackSet or  UpdateStackSet
                     operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was
                     created or updated.

                 o CURRENT : The stack is currently up to date with the  stack
                   set.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 The explanation for the specific status code assigned to this
                 stack instance.

              StackInstanceStatus -> (structure)
                 The detailed status of the stack instance.

                 DetailedStatus -> (string)

                     o CANCELLED : The operation in the specified account  and
                       Region  has  been  cancelled.  This is either because a
                       user has stopped the stack set  operation,  or  because
                       the  failure  tolerance  of the stack set operation has
                       been exceeded.

                     o FAILED : The operation in  the  specified  account  and
                       Region  failed.  If  the  stack  set operation fails in
                       enough accounts within a Region, the failure  tolerance
                       for  the  stack  set  operation  as  a  whole  might be
                       exceeded.

                     o INOPERABLE  :  A  DeleteStackInstances  operation   has
                       failed  and left the stack in an unstable state. Stacks
                       in this state are excluded from further  UpdateStackSet
                       operations.  You might need to perform a DeleteStackIn-
                       stances operation, with RetainStacks set to true  ,  to
                       delete  the  stack  instance, and then delete the stack
                       manually.

                     o PENDING : The operation in the  specified  account  and
                       Region has yet to start.

                     o RUNNING  :  The  operation in the specified account and
                       Region is currently in progress.

                     o SUCCEEDED : The operation in the specified account  and
                       Region completed successfully.

              OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                 [Service-managed  permissions]  The  organization  root ID or
                 organizational  unit  (OU)  IDs  that   you   specified   for
                 DeploymentTargets .

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status  of the stack instance's actual configuration compared
                 to the expected template and parameter configuration  of  the
                 stack set to which it belongs.

                 o DRIFTED  : The stack differs from the expected template and
                   parameter configuration  of  the  stack  set  to  which  it
                   belongs.  A stack instance is considered to have drifted if
                   one or more of the resources in the associated  stack  have
                   drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED  :  CloudFormation has not checked if the stack
                   instance differs from its expected stack set configuration.

                 o IN_SYNC : The stack instance's actual configuration matches
                   its expected stack set configuration.

                 o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion operation on the stack instance. This value will be NULL
                 for any stack instance on which drift detection has  not  yet
                 been performed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the request doesn't return all of the remaining results, NextTo-
          ken is set to a token. To retrieve the next  set  of  results,  call
          ListStackInstances  again  and  assign  that  token  to  the request
          object's NextToken parameter. If the request  returns  all  results,
          NextToken is set to null .
