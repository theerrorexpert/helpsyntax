UPDATE-STACK-SET()                                          UPDATE-STACK-SET()



NAME
       update-stack-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the stack set, and associated stack instances in the specified
       accounts and Regions.

       Even if the stack set operation created by updating the stack set fails
       (completely  or  partially,  below  or above a specified failure toler-
       ance), the stack set is updated with your changes. Subsequent  CreateS-
       tackInstances  calls  on  the specified stack set use the updated stack
       set.

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to update.

       --description (string)
          A brief description of updates that you are making.

       --template-body (string)
          The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length
          of  1  byte  and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more informa-
          tion, see Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide.

          Conditional: You must specify only one of the following  parameters:
          TemplateBody or TemplateURL or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.

       --template-url (string)
          The  location  of  the file that contains the template body. The URL
          must point to a template  (maximum  size:  460,800  bytes)  that  is
          located  in  an  Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. For
          more information, see Template Anatomy in  the  CloudFormation  User
          Guide.

          Conditional:  You must specify only one of the following parameters:
          TemplateBody or TemplateURL or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.

       --use-previous-template | --no-use-previous-template (boolean)
          Use the existing template that's associated with the stack set  that
          you're updating.

          Conditional:  You must specify only one of the following parameters:
          TemplateBody or TemplateURL or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.

       --parameters (list)
          A list of input parameters for the stack set template.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that is specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During a stack update, use the existing parameter value  that
                 the  stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. Read-only. The value that  corresponds  to  a  SSM
                 parameter  key.  This  field  is  returned  only  for  `  SSM
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types`__
                 parameter types in the template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ParameterKey=string,ParameterValue=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean,ResolvedValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ParameterKey": "string",
              "ParameterValue": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false,
              "ResolvedValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --capabilities (list)
          In  some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack tem-
          plate contains certain capabilities in order for  CloudFormation  to
          update the stack set and its associated stack instances.

          o CAPABILITY_IAM  and  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM    Some  stack templates
            might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon
            Web  Services  account;  for example, by creating new Identity and
            Access Management (IAM) users. For those  stacks  sets,  you  must
            explicitly  acknowledge  this by specifying one of these capabili-
            ties. The following IAM resources require you  to  specify  either
            the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.

            o If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

            o If  you  have  IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
              CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM .

            o If you don't specify either of these  capabilities,  CloudForma-
              tion returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

          If  your  stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
          you review all permissions associated with them and edit their  per-
          missions if necessary.

              o AWS::IAM::AccessKey

              o AWS::IAM::Group

              o AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile

              o AWS::IAM::Policy

              o AWS::IAM::Role

              o AWS::IAM::User

              o AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition

          For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudForma-
          tion Templates .

          o CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND   Some templates reference macros. If  your
            stack  set template references one or more macros, you must update
            the stack set directly from the processed template, without  first
            reviewing  the  resulting  changes  in a change set. To update the
            stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more
            information,  see  Using  CloudFormation  Macros to Perform Custom
            Processing on Templates .

          WARNING:
              Stack sets with service-managed  permissions  do  not  currently
              support  the  use  of  macros  in  templates. (This includes the
              AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms,  which  are  macros
              hosted  by  CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability
              for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if you  refer-
              ence a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CAPABILITY_IAM
            CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
            CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the  stacks
          created  from  it. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to sup-
          ported resources that are created in the stacks. You can  specify  a
          maximum number of 50 tags.

          If  you specify tags for this parameter, those tags replace any list
          of tags that are currently associated  with  this  stack  set.  This
          means:

          o If you don't specify this parameter, CloudFormation doesn't modify
            the stack's tags.

          o If you specify any tags using this parameter, you must specify all
            the  tags  that you want associated with this stack set, even tags
            you've specifed before (for example, when creating the  stack  set
            or  during a previous update of the stack set.). Any tags that you
            don't include in the updated list of tags  are  removed  from  the
            stack set, and therefore from the stacks and resources as well.

          o If  you  specify  an  empty value, CloudFormation removes all cur-
            rently associated tags.

          If you specify new tags as part of an UpdateStackSet action,  Cloud-
          Formation  checks  to see if you have the required IAM permission to
          tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently  associated  with
          the  stack  set  from  the  list of tags you specify, CloudFormation
          assumes that you want to remove those tags from the stack  set,  and
          checks  to  see  if  you  have permission to untag resources. If you
          don't have the necessary permission(s),  the  entire  UpdateStackSet
          action  fails  with an access denied error, and the stack set is not
          updated.

          (structure)
              The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be
              used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required  . A string used to identify this tag. You can spec-
                 ify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned  by
                 Amazon  Web  Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved
                 prefix: aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 Required . A string containing the value for  this  tag.  You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          Preferences  for  how  CloudFormation performs this stack set opera-
          tion.

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The  concurrency  type  of  deploying  StackSets  operations  in
              Regions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The  order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack
              operation.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail  before  CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region.
              If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation  doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region,  for  which  this  stack
              operation  can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in
              that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region,  CloudFor-
              mation  doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of accounts in which to perform this opera-
              tion at one time. This is dependent on the value of  FailureTol-
              eranceCount  .  MaxConcurrentCount  is at most one more than the
              FailureToleranceCount .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts  in  which  to  perform  this
              operation at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero. In this  case,  CloudFormation  sets  the  number  as  one
              instead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],
            "FailureToleranceCount": integer,
            "FailureTolerancePercentage": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentCount": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentPercentage": integer
          }

       --administration-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Number (ARN) of the IAM role to use to update
          this stack set.

          Specify an IAM role only if you are using  customized  administrator
          roles  to  control  which  users or groups can manage specific stack
          sets within the same administrator account.  For  more  information,
          see Granting Permissions for Stack Set Operations in the CloudForma-
          tion User Guide .

          If you specified a customized administrator role  when  you  created
          the  stack  set,  you  must specify a customized administrator role,
          even if it is the same customized administrator role used with  this
          stack set previously.

       --execution-role-name (string)
          The  name  of the IAM execution role to use to update the stack set.
          If you do not specify an execution  role,  CloudFormation  uses  the
          AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set opera-
          tion.

          Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles
          to  control  which  stack  resources users and groups can include in
          their stack sets.

          If you specify a customized execution role, CloudFormation uses that
          role  to update the stack. If you do not specify a customized execu-
          tion role, CloudFormation performs the update using the role  previ-
          ously associated with the stack set, so long as you have permissions
          to perform operations on the stack set.

       --deployment-targets (structure)
          [Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts in which to
          update associated stack instances.

          To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do
          not specify DeploymentTargets or Regions .

          If the stack set update includes changes to the template  (that  is,
          if  TemplateBody  or  TemplateURL is specified), or the Parameters ,
          CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status  of  OUTDATED
          prior  to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and
          Regions. If the stack set update does not  include  changes  to  the
          template  or  parameters, CloudFormation updates the stack instances
          in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack
          instances with their existing stack instance status.

          Accounts -> (list)
              The  names of one or more Amazon Web Services accounts for which
              you want to deploy stack set updates.

              (string)

          AccountsUrl -> (string)
              Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

          OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
              The organization root ID or  organizational  unit  (OU)  IDs  to
              which StackSets deploys.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accounts=string,string,AccountsUrl=string,OrganizationalUnitIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Accounts": ["string", ...],
            "AccountsUrl": "string",
            "OrganizationalUnitIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --permission-model (string)
          Describes  how  the  IAM roles required for stack set operations are
          created. You  cannot  modify  PermissionModel  if  there  are  stack
          instances associated with your stack set.

          o With  self-managed  permissions, you must create the administrator
            and execution roles required to deploy  to  target  accounts.  For
            more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions .

          o With  service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically creates
            the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by  Organiza-
            tions.  For  more information, see Grant Service-Managed Stack Set
            Permissions .

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_MANAGED

          o SELF_MANAGED

       --auto-deployment (structure)
          [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets  automati-
          cally  deploys  to Organizations accounts that are added to a target
          organization or organizational unit (OU).

          If you specify AutoDeployment , do not specify DeploymentTargets  or
          Regions .

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              If  set  to  true  ,  StackSets automatically deploys additional
              stack instances to Organizations accounts that are  added  to  a
              target organization or organizational unit (OU) in the specified
              Regions. If an account is removed from a target organization  or
              OU,  StackSets  deletes  stack instances from the account in the
              specified Regions.

          RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval -> (boolean)
              If set to true , stack resources are retained when an account is
              removed  from  a  target  organization  or OU. If set to false ,
              stack resources are deleted. Specify only if Enabled is  set  to
              True .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval": true|false
          }

       --operation-id (string)
          The unique ID for this stack set operation.

          The  operation  ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure
          that CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even
          if  you  retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set
          operation  requests  to  ensure  that  CloudFormation   successfully
          received them.

          If  you  don't specify an operation ID, CloudFormation generates one
          automatically.

          Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation  ID  retries
          all stack instances whose status is OUTDATED .

       --accounts (list)
          [Self-managed  permissions]  The accounts in which to update associ-
          ated stack instances. If you specify accounts, you must also specify
          the Regions in which to update stack set instances.

          To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do
          not specify the Accounts or Regions properties.

          If the stack set update includes changes to the template  (that  is,
          if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the
          Parameters property, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a
          status  of  OUTDATED  prior  to  updating the stack instances in the
          specified accounts and Regions. If the stack  set  update  does  not
          include  changes  to  the  template  or  parameters,  CloudFormation
          updates the stack instances in the specified accounts  and  Regions,
          while  leaving  all  other stack instances with their existing stack
          instance status.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --regions (list)
          The Regions in which to update associated stack  instances.  If  you
          specify  Regions,  you must also specify accounts in which to update
          stack set instances.

          To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do
          not specify the Accounts or Regions properties.

          If  the  stack set update includes changes to the template (that is,
          if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the
          Parameters property, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a
          status of OUTDATED prior to updating  the  stack  instances  in  the
          specified  accounts  and  Regions.  If the stack set update does not
          include  changes  to  the  template  or  parameters,  CloudFormation
          updates  the  stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions,
          while leaving all other stack instances with  their  existing  stack
          instance status.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --managed-execution (structure)
          Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations con-
          currently and queues conflicting operations.

          Active -> (boolean)
              When  true  , StackSets performs non-conflicting operations con-
              currently and queues conflicting operations.  After  conflicting
              operations finish, StackSets starts queued operations in request
              order.

              NOTE:
                 If there are already running or queued operations,  StackSets
                 queues all incoming operations even if they are non-conflict-
                 ing.

                 You can't modify your  stack  set's  execution  configuration
                 while  there  are running or queued operations for that stack
                 set.

              When false (default), StackSets performs one operation at a time
              in request order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Active=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Active": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a stack set

       The  following  update-stack-set  example  adds a tag with the key name
       Owner and a value of IT to the stack instances in the  specified  stack
       set.

          aws cloudformation update-stack-set \
              --stack-set-name my-stack-set \
              --use-previous-template \
              --tags Key=Owner,Value=IT

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "e2b60321-6cab-xmpl-bde7-530c6f47950e"
          }

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique ID for this stack set operation.
