LIST-EXPORTS()                                                  LIST-EXPORTS()



NAME
       list-exports -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all exported output values in the account and Region in which you
       call this action. Use this action to see  the  exported  output  values
       that  you  can  import  into  other stacks. To import values, use the `
       Fn::ImportValue
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-importvalue.html`__
       function.

       For more information, see CloudFormation Export Stack Output Values .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-exports is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Exports

SYNOPSIS
            list-exports
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list exports

       The  following list-exports example displays a list of the exports from
       stacks in the current region.

       Output:

          {
              "Exports": [

OUTPUT
       Exports -> (list)
          The output for the  ListExports action.

          (structure)
              The Export structure describes the exported output values for  a
              stack.

              ExportingStackId -> (string)
                 The stack that contains the exported output name and value.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  exported  output  value. Use this name and the
                 Fn::ImportValue function to import the associated value  into
                 other  stacks. The name is defined in the Export field in the
                 associated stack's Outputs section.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the exported output, such as a resource physical
                 ID.  This value is defined in the Export field in the associ-
                 ated stack's Outputs section.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the output exceeds 100 exported  output  values,  a  string  that
          identifies the next page of exports. If there is no additional page,
          this value is null.
