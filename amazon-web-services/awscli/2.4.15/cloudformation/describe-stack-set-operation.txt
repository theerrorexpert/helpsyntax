NAME
       describe-stack-set-operation -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the description of the specified stack set operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-set-operation
          --stack-set-name <value>
          --operation-id <value>
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or the unique stack ID of the stack set for the stack oper-
          ation.

       --operation-id (string)
          The unique ID of the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a stack set operation

       The  following  describe-stack-set-operation`  example displays details
       for an update operation on the specified stack set.

          aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation \
              --stack-set-name enable-config \
              --operation-id 35d45ebc-ed88-xmpl-ab59-0197a1fc83a0

                          "us-east-1",
                          "us-west-2",

          }

OUTPUT
       StackSetOperation -> (structure)
          The specified stack set operation.

          OperationId -> (string)
              The unique ID of a stack set operation.

          StackSetId -> (string)
              The ID of the stack set.

          Action -> (string)
              The type of stack set operation: CREATE , UPDATE , or  DELETE  .
              Create and delete operations affect only the specified stack set
              instances that are associated  with  the  specified  stack  set.
              Update  operations  affect both the stack set itself, as well as
              all associated stack set instances.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the operation.

              o FAILED : The operation exceeded the specified  failure  toler-
                ance. The failure tolerance value that you've set for an oper-
                ation is applied for  each  Region  during  stack  create  and
                update  operations.  If  the  number of failed stacks within a
                Region exceeds the failure tolerance, the status of the opera-
                tion  in  the  Region is set to FAILED . This in turn sets the
                status of the operation as a whole to FAILED , and CloudForma-
                tion cancels the operation in any remaining Regions.

              o QUEUED  :  [Service-managed permissions] For automatic deploy-
                ments that require a sequence of operations, the operation  is
                queued  to  be  performed. For more information, see the stack
                set operation status codes in the CloudFormation User Guide.

              o RUNNING : The operation is currently being performed.

              o STOPPED : The user has cancelled the operation.

              o STOPPING : The operation is in the  process  of  stopping,  at
                user request.

              o SUCCEEDED  :  The operation completed creating or updating all
                the specified stacks without exceeding the  failure  tolerance
                for the operation.

          OperationPreferences -> (structure)
              The  preferences  for how CloudFormation performs this stack set
              operation.

              RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
                 The concurrency type of  deploying  StackSets  operations  in
                 Regions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

              RegionOrder -> (list)
                 The  order  of  the  Regions in where you want to perform the
                 stack operation.

                 (string)

              FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
                 The number of accounts, per Region, for which this  operation
                 can  fail  before  CloudFormation stops the operation in that
                 Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region,  CloudForma-
                 tion doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

                 Conditional: You must specify either FailureToleranceCount or
                 FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

                 By default, 0 is specified.

              FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
                 The  percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack
                 operation can fail before CloudFormation stops the  operation
                 in  that  Region.  If  the  operation is stopped in a Region,
                 CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation  in  any  subse-
                 quent Regions.

                 When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the speci-
                 fied percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole
                 number.

                 Conditional: You must specify either FailureToleranceCount or
                 FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

                 By default, 0 is specified.

              MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this oper-
                 ation at one time. This is dependent on the value of Failure-
                 ToleranceCount . MaxConcurrentCount is at most one more  than
                 the FailureToleranceCount .

                 Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum for oper-
                 ations. For large deployments,  under  certain  circumstances
                 the  actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be
                 lower due to service throttling.

                 Conditional: You must specify  either  MaxConcurrentCount  or
                 MaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

                 By default, 1 is specified.

              MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  percentage of accounts in which to perform this
                 operation at one time.

                 When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  speci-
                 fied percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole
                 number. This is true except  in  cases  where  rounding  down
                 would  result  is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the
                 number as one instead.

                 Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum for oper-
                 ations.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances
                 the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be
                 lower due to service throttling.

                 Conditional:  You  must  specify either MaxConcurrentCount or
                 MaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

                 By default, 1 is specified.

          RetainStacks -> (boolean)
              For stack set operations  of  action  type  DELETE  ,  specifies
              whether  to  remove the stack instances from the specified stack
              set, but doesn't delete the  stacks.  You  can't  reassociate  a
              retained  stack,  or add an existing, saved stack to a new stack
              set.

          AdministrationRoleARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the IAM role used to perform
              this stack set operation.

              Use  customized  administrator  roles  to control which users or
              groups can manage specific stack sets within the  same  adminis-
              trator account. For more information, see Define Permissions for
              Multiple Administrators in the CloudFormation User Guide .

          ExecutionRoleName -> (string)
              The name of the IAM execution role used to create or update  the
              stack set.

              Use  customized execution roles to control which stack resources
              users and groups can include in their stack sets.

          CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the operation was  initiated.  Note  that  the
              creation times for the stack set operation might differ from the
              creation time of  the  individual  stacks  themselves.  This  is
              because CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work for the
              operation,  such  as  dispatching  the  work  to  the  requested
              Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.

          EndTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  time  at  which  the  stack set operation ended, across all
              accounts and Regions specified. Note that this doesn't necessar-
              ily  mean  that  the stack set operation was successful, or even
              attempted, in each account or Region.

          DeploymentTargets -> (structure)
              [Service-managed   permissions]   The   Organizations   accounts
              affected by the stack operation.

              Accounts -> (list)
                 The  names  of  one  or more Amazon Web Services accounts for
                 which you want to deploy stack set updates.

                 (string)

              AccountsUrl -> (string)
                 Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

              OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
                 The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU)  IDs  to
                 which StackSets deploys.

                 (string)

          StackSetDriftDetectionDetails -> (structure)
              Detailed  information  about  the drift status of the stack set.
              This includes information about drift operations currently being
              performed on the stack set.

              this  information  will only be present for stack set operations
              whose Action type is DETECT_DRIFT .

              For more information, see Detecting Unmanaged Changes  in  Stack
              Sets in the CloudFormation User Guide.

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status  of  the  stack set's actual configuration compared to
                 its expected template and parameter  configuration.  A  stack
                 set is considered to have drifted if one or more of its stack
                 instances have  drifted  from  their  expected  template  and
                 parameter configuration.

                 o DRIFTED  :  One or more of the stack instances belonging to
                   the stack set stack differs from the expected template  and
                   parameter  configuration. A stack instance is considered to
                   have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associ-
                   ated stack have drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED  : CloudFormation has not checked the stack set
                   for drift.

                 o IN_SYNC : All of the stack instances belonging to the stack
                   set  stack  match  from the expected template and parameter
                   configuration.

              DriftDetectionStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the stack set drift detection operation.

                 o COMPLETED : The drift detection operation completed without
                   failing on any stack instances.

                 o FAILED  : The drift detection operation exceeded the speci-
                   fied failure tolerance.

                 o PARTIAL_SUCCESS : The drift detection  operation  completed
                   without  exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation.

                 o IN_PROGRESS : The drift detection  operation  is  currently
                   being performed.

                 o STOPPED : The user has cancelled the drift detection opera-
                   tion.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion  operation on the stack set. This value will be NULL for
                 any stack set on which drift detection has not yet been  per-
                 formed.

              TotalStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  total  number of stack instances belonging to this stack
                 set.

                 The total number of stack instances is equal to the total of:

                 o Stack instances that match the stack set configuration.

                 o Stack  instances  that have drifted from the stack set con-
                   figuration.

                 o Stack instances where the  drift  detection  operation  has
                   failed.

                 o Stack instances currently being checked for drift.

              DriftedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  stack  instances  that have drifted from the
                 expected template and parameter configuration  of  the  stack
                 set. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or
                 more of the resources in the associated stack  do  not  match
                 their expected configuration.

              InSyncStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of stack instances which match the expected tem-
                 plate and parameter configuration of the stack set.

              InProgressStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The number  of  stack  instances  that  are  currently  being
                 checked for drift.

              FailedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of stack instances for which the drift detection
                 operation failed.
