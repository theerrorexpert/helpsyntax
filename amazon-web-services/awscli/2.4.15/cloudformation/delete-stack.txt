DELETE-STACK()                                                  DELETE-STACK()



NAME
       delete-stack -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a specified stack. Once the call completes successfully, stack
       deletion starts. Deleted stacks do not show up in  the   DescribeStacks
       API if the deletion has been completed successfully.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-stack
          --stack-name <value>
          [--retain-resources <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack.

       --retain-resources (list)
          For  stacks  in  the DELETE_FAILED state, a list of resource logical
          IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain.  Dur-
          ing  deletion,  CloudFormation deletes the stack but does not delete
          the retained resources.

          Retaining resources is useful when you  cannot  delete  a  resource,
          such as a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to delete the  stack.  Cloud-
          Formation  uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.

          If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that  was
          previously  associated  with  the  stack.  If  no role is available,
          CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from  your
          user credentials.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this DeleteStack request. Specify this token
          if you plan to retry requests  so  that  CloudFormation  knows  that
          you're  not  attempting  to  delete  a stack with the same name. You
          might retry DeleteStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation  suc-
          cessfully received them.

          All  events  triggered  by  a given stack operation are assigned the
          same client request token, which you can use  to  track  operations.
          For  example,  if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token
          token1 , then all the StackEvents generated by that  operation  will
          have ClientRequestToken set as token1 .

          In the console, stack operations display the client request token on
          the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console
          use  the  token  format  Console-StackOperation-ID , which helps you
          easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you  create  a
          stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same
          token     in     the     following     format:      Console-CreateS-
          tack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a stack

       The following delete-stack example deletes the specified stack.

          aws cloudformation delete-stack \
              --stack-name my-stack

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
