TEST-TYPE()                                                        TEST-TYPE()



NAME
       test-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests  a  registered  extension  to  make  sure  it meets all necessary
       requirements for being published in the CloudFormation registry.

       o For resource types, this includes passing all contracts tests defined
         for the type.

       o For  modules,  this  includes determining if the module's model meets
         all necessary requirements.

       For more information, see Testing your public extension prior  to  pub-
       lishing in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

       If  you  do not specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default ver-
       sion of the extension in your account and region for testing.

       To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified
       when  the type was registered. For more information, see RegisterType .

       Once you've initiated testing on an extension using TestType , you  can
       use  DescribeType  to  monitor  the current test status and test status
       description for the extension.

       An extension must have a test status of PASSED before it  can  be  pub-
       lished.  For  more  information, see Publishing extensions to make them
       available for public use in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            test-type
          [--arn <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--type-name <value>]
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--log-delivery-bucket <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --type (string)
          The type of the extension to test.

          Conditional: You must specify Arn , or TypeName and Type .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

       --type-name (string)
          The name of the extension to test.

          Conditional: You must specify Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --version-id (string)
          The version of the extension to test.

          You can specify the version id with either Arn ,  or  with  TypeName
          and Type .

          If  you  do  not  specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default
          version of the extension in this account and region for testing.

       --log-delivery-bucket (string)
          The S3 bucket to which CloudFormation  delivers  the  contract  test
          execution logs.

          CloudFormation  delivers  the  logs by the time contract testing has
          completed and the extension has been assigned a test type status  of
          PASSED or FAILED .

          The user calling TestType must be able to access items in the speci-
          fied S3 bucket. Specifically, the user needs the  following  permis-
          sions:

          o GetObject

          o PutObject

          For more information, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for
          Amazon S3 in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access  Management
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To test an extension

       The  following  test-type  example tests a registered extension to make
       sure it meets all necessary requirements for  being  published  in  the
       CloudFormation registry.

          aws cloudformation test-type \
              --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/Sample-Test-Resource123/00000001

       Output:

          {
              "TypeVersionArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/Sample-Test-Resource123/00000001"
          }

       For  more information, see Using the AWS CloudFormation registry in the
       AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

OUTPUT
       TypeVersionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the extension.
