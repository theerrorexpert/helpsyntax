NAME
       describe-publisher -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a CloudFormation extension publisher.

       If  you  do  not  supply  a PublisherId , and you have registered as an
       extension publisher, DescribePublisher returns information  about  your
       own publisher account.

       For more information on registering as a publisher, see:

       o RegisterPublisher

       o Publishing  extensions  to  make them available for public use in the
         CloudFormation CLI User Guide

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-publisher
          [--publisher-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --publisher-id (string)
          The ID of the extension publisher.

          If you do not supply a PublisherId , and you have registered  as  an
          extension  publisher,  DescribePublisher  returns  information about
          your own publisher account.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
