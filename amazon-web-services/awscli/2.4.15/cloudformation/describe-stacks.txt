DESCRIBE-STACKS()                                            DESCRIBE-STACKS()



NAME
       describe-stacks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description for the specified stack; if no stack name was
       specified, then it returns the description for all the stacks  created.

       NOTE:
          If the stack does not exist, an ValidationError is returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-stacks  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Stacks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stacks
          [--stack-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with  the  stack,
          which are not always interchangeable:

          o Running  stacks:  You  can  specify either the stack's name or its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     ParameterKey -> (string)
                        The key associated with the parameter.  If  you  don't
                        specify  a  key  and value for a particular parameter,
                        CloudFormation uses the default value that  is  speci-
                        fied in your template.

                     ParameterValue -> (string)
                        The input value associated with the parameter.

                     UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                        During  a  stack  update,  use  the existing parameter
                        value that the stack is using for  a  given  parameter
                        key.  If you specify true , do not specify a parameter
                        value.

                     ResolvedValue -> (string)
                        Read-only. Read-only. The value that corresponds to  a
                        SSM  parameter  key. This field is returned only for `
                        SSM
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types`__

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the stack was last updated. This field will only  be
                 returned if the stack has been updated at least once.

              RollbackConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  rollback  triggers  for CloudFormation to monitor during
                 stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified
                 monitoring period afterwards.

                 RollbackTriggers -> (list)
                     The  triggers  to monitor during stack creation or update
                     actions.

                     By default, CloudFormation saves  the  rollback  triggers
                     specified  for a stack and applies them to any subsequent
                     update operations for the stack, unless you specify  oth-
                     erwise.  If  you  do  specify  rollback triggers for this
                     parameter, those triggers replace any  list  of  triggers
                     previously specified for the stack. This means:

                     o To  use  the rollback triggers previously specified for
                       this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.

                     o To specify new or updated rollback triggers,  you  must
                       specify  all  the  triggers that you want used for this
                       stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for  exam-
                       ple, when creating the stack or during a previous stack
                       update). Any triggers that you  don't  include  in  the
                       updated  list  of triggers are no longer applied to the
                       stack.

                     o To remove all currently specified triggers, specify  an
                       empty list for this parameter.

                     If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack oper-
                     ation fails and is rolled back.

                     (structure)
                        A rollback trigger CloudFormation monitors during cre-
                        ation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you
                        specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation
                        or  within the specified monitoring period afterwards,
                        CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack  operation.

                        Arn -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the rollback
                            trigger.

                            If a specified  trigger  is  missing,  the  entire
                            stack operation fails and is rolled back.

                        Type -> (string)
                            The resource type of the rollback trigger. Specify
                            either          AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm          or
                            AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm resource types.

                 MonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The  amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudForma-
                     tion should monitor all the rollback triggers  after  the
                     stack  creation or update operation deploys all necessary
                     resources.

                     The default is 0 minutes.

                     If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any
                     rollback  triggers, CloudFormation still waits the speci-
                     fied period of time  before  cleaning  up  old  resources
                     after  update  operations.  You  can  use this monitoring
                     period to perform any manual  stack  validation  desired,
                     and  manually  cancel the stack creation or update (using
                     CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.

                     If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still
                     monitors  the  specified  rollback  triggers during stack
                     creation and update operations. Then, for  update  opera-
                     tions,  it  begins disposing of old resources immediately
                     once the operation completes.

              StackStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the stack.

              StackStatusReason -> (string)
                 Success/failure message associated with the stack status.

              DisableRollback -> (boolean)
                 Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation fail-
                 ures:

                 o true : disable rollback

                 o false : enable rollback

              NotificationARNs -> (list)
                 SNS topic ARNs to which stack related events are published.

                 (string)

              TimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  time within which stack creation should com-
                 plete.

              Capabilities -> (list)
                 The capabilities allowed in the stack.

                 (string)

              Outputs -> (list)
                 A list of output structures.

                 (structure)
                     The Output data type.

                     OutputKey -> (string)
                        The key associated with the output.

                     OutputValue -> (string)
                        The value associated with the output.

                     Description -> (string)
                        User defined description associated with the output.

                     ExportName -> (string)
                        The name of the export associated with the output.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Man-
                 agement  (IAM) role that is associated with the stack. During
                 a stack operation, CloudFormation uses  this  role's  creden-
                 tials to make calls on your behalf.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of Tag s that specify information about the stack.

                 (structure)
                     The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that
                     can be used to store information about an  CloudFormation
                     stack.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Required . A string used to identify this tag. You can
                        specify a maximum of 128 characters  for  a  tag  key.
                        Tags  owned  by  Amazon  Web Services (Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices) have the reserved prefix: aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        Required . A string containing the value for this tag.
                        You  can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag
                        value.

              EnableTerminationProtection -> (boolean)
                 Whether termination protection is enabled for the stack.

                 For nested stacks , termination protection is set on the root
                 stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack. For
                 more information, see Protecting a Stack From  Being  Deleted
                 in the CloudFormation User Guide .

              ParentId -> (string)
                 For  nested  stacks--stacks  created as resources for another
                 stack--the stack ID of the direct parent of this  stack.  For
                 the  first level of nested stacks, the root stack is also the
                 parent stack.

                 For more information, see Working with Nested Stacks  in  the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              RootId -> (string)
                 For  nested  stacks--stacks  created as resources for another
                 stack--the stack ID of  the  top-level  stack  to  which  the
                 nested stack ultimately belongs.

                 For  more  information, see Working with Nested Stacks in the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              DriftInformation -> (structure)
                 Information on whether a stack's  actual  configuration  dif-
                 fers,  or  has drifted , from it's expected configuration, as
                 defined in the stack template and  any  values  specified  as
                 template  parameters.  For  more  information,  see Detecting
                 Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

                 StackDriftStatus -> (string)
                     Status of the stack's actual  configuration  compared  to
                     its expected template configuration.

                     o DRIFTED  : The stack differs from its expected template
                       configuration. A stack is considered to have drifted if
                       one or more of its resources have drifted.

                     o NOT_CHECKED  :  CloudFormation  has  not checked if the
                       stack differs from its expected template configuration.

                     o IN_SYNC  : The stack's actual configuration matches its
                       expected template configuration.

                     o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

                 LastCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     Most recent time when a  drift  detection  operation  was
                     initiated   on  the  stack,  or  any  of  its  individual
                     resources that support drift detection.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the output exceeds 1 MB in size, a  string  that  identifies  the
          next  page  of  stacks.  If no additional page exists, this value is
          null.
