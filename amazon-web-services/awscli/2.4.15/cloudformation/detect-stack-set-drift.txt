DETECT-STACK-SET-DRIFT()                              DETECT-STACK-SET-DRIFT()



NAME
       detect-stack-set-drift -

DESCRIPTION
       Detect  drift on a stack set. When CloudFormation performs drift detec-
       tion on a stack set, it performs drift detection on the  stack  associ-
       ated  with  each stack instance in the stack set. For more information,
       see How CloudFormation Performs Drift Detection on a Stack Set .
          DetectStackSetDrift returns the OperationId of the stack  set  drift
          detection operation. Use this operation id with ``  DescribeStackSe-
          tOperation `` to monitor the progress of the drift detection  opera-
          tion. The drift detection operation may take some time, depending on
          the number of stack instances included in the stack set, as well  as
          the number of resources included in each stack.

       Once  the  operation has completed, use the following actions to return
       drift information:

       o Use ``  DescribeStackSet `` to return detailed information about  the
         stack  set,  including  detailed information about the last completed
         drift operation performed on the stack set. (Information about  drift
         operations that are in progress is not included.)

       o Use  ``   ListStackInstances  ``  to return a list of stack instances
         belonging to the stack set, including the drift status and last drift
         time checked of each instance.

       o Use ``  DescribeStackInstance `` to return detailed information about
         a specific stack instance, including its drift status and last  drift
         time checked.

       For  more  information  on  performing a drift detection operation on a
       stack set, see Detecting Unmanaged Changes in Stack Sets .

       You can only run a single drift detection operation on  a  given  stack
       set at one time.

       To  stop a drift detection stack set operation, use ``  StopStackSetOp-
       eration `` .

SYNOPSIS
            detect-stack-set-drift
          --stack-set-name <value>
          [--operation-preferences <value>]
          [--operation-id <value>]
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name of the stack set on which to perform  the  drift  detection
          operation.

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          The  user-specified  preferences  for  how CloudFormation performs a
          stack set operation.

          For more information on maximum concurrent accounts and failure tol-
          erance, see Stack set operation options .

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The  concurrency  type  of  deploying  StackSets  operations  in
              Regions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The order of the Regions in where you want to perform the  stack
              operation.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in  that  Region.
              If  the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The  percentage  of  accounts,  per Region, for which this stack
              operation can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation  in
              that  Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent  Regions.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of accounts in which to perform  this  opera-
              tion  at one time. This is dependent on the value of FailureTol-
              eranceCount . MaxConcurrentCount is at most one  more  than  the
              FailureToleranceCount .

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The  maximum  percentage  of  accounts  in which to perform this
              operation at one time.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero.  In  this  case,  CloudFormation  sets  the  number as one
              instead.

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],
            "FailureToleranceCount": integer,
            "FailureTolerancePercentage": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentCount": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentPercentage": integer
          }

       --operation-id (string)
          The ID of the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detect drift on a stack set and all associated stack instances

       The  following detect-stack-set-drift example initiates drift detection
       operations  on  the  specified  stack  set,  including  all  the  stack
       instances  associated  with that stack set, and returns an operation ID
       that can be used to track the status of the drift operation.

          aws cloudformation detect-stack-set-drift \
              --stack-set-name stack-set-drift-example

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For more information, see Detecting Unmanaged Configuration Changes  in
       Stack Sets in the AWS CloudFormation Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The ID of the drift detection stack set operation.

          you  can use this operation id with ``  DescribeStackSetOperation ``
          to monitor the progress of the drift detection operation.
