CREATE-STACK()                                                  CREATE-STACK()



NAME
       create-stack -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes
       successfully, the stack creation starts. You can check  the  status  of
       the stack via the  DescribeStacks API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name that is associated with the stack. The name must be unique
          in the Region in which you are creating the stack.

          NOTE:
              A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sen-
              sitive)  and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetical charac-
              ter and cannot be longer than 128 characters.

       --template-body (string)
          Structure containing the template body with a minimum  length  of  1
          byte  and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, go
          to Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide.

          Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the Templa-
          teURL parameter, but not both.

       --template-url (string)
          Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to
          a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3
          bucket  or  a  Systems Manager document. For more information, go to
          the Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide.

          Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the Templa-
          teURL parameter, but not both.

       --parameters (list)
          A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
          stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that is specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During a stack update, use the existing parameter value  that
                 the  stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. Read-only. The value that  corresponds  to  a  SSM
                 parameter  key.  This  field  is  returned  only  for  `  SSM
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types`__
                 parameter types in the template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ParameterKey=string,ParameterValue=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean,ResolvedValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ParameterKey": "string",
              "ParameterValue": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false,
              "ResolvedValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --disable-rollback | --no-disable-rollback (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to  disable  rollback  of the stack if stack creation
          failed. You can specify either DisableRollback or  OnFailure  ,  but
          not both.

          Default: false

       --rollback-configuration (structure)
          The  rollback  triggers  for  CloudFormation to monitor during stack
          creation and updating operations, and for the  specified  monitoring
          period afterwards.

          RollbackTriggers -> (list)
              The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.

              By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified
              for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations
              for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you  do  specify
              rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any
              list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

              o To  use  the  rollback  triggers previously specified for this
                stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.

              o To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must  specify
                all the triggers that you want used for this stack, even trig-
                gers you've specifed before (for example,  when  creating  the
                stack  or  during  a previous stack update). Any triggers that
                you don't include in the  updated  list  of  triggers  are  no
                longer applied to the stack.

              o To  remove  all currently specified triggers, specify an empty
                list for this parameter.

              If a specified trigger is missing, the  entire  stack  operation
              fails and is rolled back.

              (structure)
                 A  rollback  trigger  CloudFormation monitors during creation
                 and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes
                 to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the spec-
                 ified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back
                 the entire stack operation.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                     If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack oper-
                     ation fails and is rolled back.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The resource type of the rollback trigger. Specify either
                     AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm or AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm
                     resource types.

          MonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
              The amount of time,  in  minutes,  during  which  CloudFormation
              should  monitor  all  the rollback triggers after the stack cre-
              ation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

              The default is 0 minutes.

              If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any  roll-
              back  triggers,  CloudFormation still waits the specified period
              of time before cleaning up old  resources  after  update  opera-
              tions.  You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual
              stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation
              or  update (using CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.

              If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still  moni-
              tors  the  specified rollback triggers during stack creation and
              update operations. Then, for update operations, it  begins  dis-
              posing  of  old  resources  immediately  once the operation com-
              pletes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RollbackTriggers=[{Arn=string,Type=string},{Arn=string,Type=string}],MonitoringTimeInMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RollbackTriggers": [
              {
                "Arn": "string",
                "Type": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "MonitoringTimeInMinutes": integer
          }

       --timeout-in-minutes (integer)
          The amount of time that can pass before  the  stack  status  becomes
          CREATE_FAILED;  if  DisableRollback  is not set or is set to false ,
          the stack will be rolled back.

       --notification-arns (list)
          The Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic ARNs  to  publish  stack
          related  events. You can find your SNS topic ARNs using the SNS con-
          sole or your Command Line Interface (CLI).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --capabilities (list)
          In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack  tem-
          plate  contains  certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to
          create the stack.

          o CAPABILITY_IAM and  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM    Some  stack  templates
            might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon
            Web Services account; for example, by creating  new  Identity  and
            Access  Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explic-
            itly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The
            following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABIL-
            ITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.

            o If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

            o If you have IAM resources with custom names,  you  must  specify
              CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM .

            o If  you  don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudForma-
              tion returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

          If your stack template contains these resources, we  recommend  that
          you  review all permissions associated with them and edit their per-
          missions if necessary.

              o AWS::IAM::AccessKey

              o AWS::IAM::Group

              o AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile

              o AWS::IAM::Policy

              o AWS::IAM::Role

              o AWS::IAM::User

              o AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition

          For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudForma-
          tion Templates .

          o CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND   Some template contain macros. Macros per-
            form custom processing  on  templates;  this  can  include  simple
            actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive
            transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users  typi-
            cally  create  a  change  set from the processed template, so that
            they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actu-
            ally  creating  the  stack. If your stack template contains one or
            more macros, and you choose to create a stack  directly  from  the
            processed  template, without first reviewing the resulting changes
            in a change  set,  you  must  acknowledge  this  capability.  This
            includes  the  AWS::Include  and AWS::Serverless transforms, which
            are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to create a stack
            from  a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you
            must create the stack directly from the template using this  capa-
            bility.

          WARNING:
                 You  should only create stacks directly from a stack template
                 that contains macros if you know what  processing  the  macro
                 performs.  Each  macro relies on an underlying Lambda service
                 function for processing stack templates. Be  aware  that  the
                 Lambda function owner can update the function operation with-
                 out CloudFormation being notified.

              For more information, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform
              Custom Processing on Templates .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CAPABILITY_IAM
            CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
            CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND

       --resource-types (list)
          The  template  resource types that you have permissions to work with
          for  this  create  stack  action,  such  as   AWS::EC2::Instance   ,
          AWS::EC2::* , or Custom::MyCustomInstance . Use the following syntax
          to describe template resource types: AWS::* (for all Amazon Web Ser-
          vices   resources),  Custom::*  (for  all  custom  resources),  Cus-
          tom::*logical_ID* `` (for a specific custom resource),  ``AWS::*ser-
          vice_name*  ::*  (for  all resources of a particular Amazon Web Ser-
          vices service), and
          ``
          AWS::service_name ::resource_logical_ID `` (for  a  specific  Amazon
          Web Services resource).

          If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're
          creating, the  stack  creation  fails.  By  default,  CloudFormation
          grants  permissions  to all resource types. Identity and Access Man-
          agement (IAM) uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condi-
          tion  keys  in  IAM  policies. For more information, see Controlling
          Access with Identity and Access Management .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access  Management
          (IAM)  role  that CloudFormation assumes to create the stack. Cloud-
          Formation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your  behalf.
          CloudFormation  always  uses  this role for all future operations on
          the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack,
          CloudFormation  uses  this role even if the users don't have permis-
          sion to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

          If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that  was
          previously  associated  with  the  stack.  If  no role is available,
          CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from  your
          user credentials.

       --on-failure (string)
          Determines  what  action will be taken if stack creation fails. This
          must be one of: DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or  DELETE.  You  can  specify
          either OnFailure or DisableRollback , but not both.

          Default: ROLLBACK

          Possible values:

          o DO_NOTHING

          o ROLLBACK

          o DELETE

       --stack-policy-body (string)
          Structure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go
          to Prevent Updates to Stack Resources  in  the  CloudFormation  User
          Guide . You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPoli-
          cyURL parameter, but not both.

       --stack-policy-url (string)
          Location of a file containing the stack policy. The URL  must  point
          to  a  policy  (maximum  size: 16 KB) located in an S3 bucket in the
          same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody
          or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.

       --tags (list)
          Key-value  pairs  to  associate with this stack. CloudFormation also
          propagates these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maxi-
          mum number of 50 tags can be specified.

          (structure)
              The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be
              used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required . A string used to identify this tag. You can  spec-
                 ify  a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by
                 Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) have  the  reserved
                 prefix: aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 Required  .  A  string containing the value for this tag. You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this CreateStack request. Specify this token
          if  you  plan  to  retry  requests so that CloudFormation knows that
          you're not attempting to create a stack  with  the  same  name.  You
          might  retry CreateStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation suc-
          cessfully received them.

          All events triggered by a given stack  operation  are  assigned  the
          same  client  request  token, which you can use to track operations.
          For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with  the  token
          token1  ,  then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will
          have ClientRequestToken set as token1 .

          In the console, stack operations display the client request token on
          the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console
          use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID  ,  which  helps  you
          easily  identify  the stack operation . For example, if you create a
          stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same
          token      in     the     following     format:     Console-CreateS-
          tack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .

       --enable-termination-protection  |   --no-enable-termination-protection
       (boolean)
          Whether  to enable termination protection on the specified stack. If
          a user attempts  to  delete  a  stack  with  termination  protection
          enabled,  the  operation  fails and the stack remains unchanged. For
          more information, see Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted  in  the
          CloudFormation  User  Guide  . Termination protection is disabled on
          stacks by default.

          For nested stacks , termination protection is set on the root  stack
          and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an AWS CloudFormation stack

       The  following  create-stacks  command  creates  a  stack with the name
       myteststack using the sampletemplate.json template:

          aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name myteststack --template-body file://sampletemplate.json --parameters ParameterKey=KeyPairName,ParameterValue=TestKey ParameterKey=SubnetIDs,ParameterValue=SubnetID1\\,SubnetID2

       Output:
