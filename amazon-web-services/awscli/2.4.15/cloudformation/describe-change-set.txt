DESCRIBE-CHANGE-SET()                                    DESCRIBE-CHANGE-SET()



NAME
       describe-change-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the inputs for the change set and a list of changes that Cloud-
       Formation will make if you execute the change set.  For  more  informa-
       tion,  see Updating Stacks Using Change Sets in the CloudFormation User
       Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-change-set is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Changes

SYNOPSIS
            describe-change-set
          --change-set-name <value>
          [--stack-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --change-set-name (string)
          The  name  or  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the change set that you
          want to describe.

       --stack-name (string)
          If you specified the name of a change set, specify the stack name or
          ID (ARN) of the change set you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a change set

       The  following  describe-change-set example displays the details of the
       change set specified by change set name and stack name.

          aws cloudformation describe-change-set \
              --change-set-name my-change-set \
              --stack-name my-stack

       The following describe-change-set example displays the details  of  the
       change set specified by the full ARN of the change set:

          aws cloudformation describe-change-set \
              --change-set-name arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:changeSet/my-change-set/bc9555ba-a949-xmpl-bfb8-f41d04ec5784

OUTPUT
       ChangeSetName -> (string)
          The name of the change set.

       ChangeSetId -> (string)
          The ARN of the change set.

       StackId -> (string)
          The ARN of the stack that is associated with the change set.

       StackName -> (string)
          The name of the stack that is associated with the change set.

       Description -> (string)
          Information about the change set.

       Parameters -> (list)
          A  list  of Parameter structures that describes the input parameters
          and their values used to create the change set.  For  more  informa-
          tion, see the Parameter data type.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that is specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During  a stack update, use the existing parameter value that
                 the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you  specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only.  Read-only.  The  value  that corresponds to a SSM
                 parameter  key.  This  field  is  returned  only  for  `  SSM
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types`__
                 parameter types in the template.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The start time when the change set was created, in UTC.

       ExecutionStatus -> (string)
          If the change set execution status is AVAILABLE ,  you  can  execute
          the change set. If you cant execute the change set, the status indi-
          cates why. For example, a change set  might  be  in  an  UNAVAILABLE
          state  because CloudFormation is still creating it or in an OBSOLETE
          state because the stack was already updated.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the change set, such as  CREATE_IN_PROGRESS  ,
          CREATE_COMPLETE , or FAILED .

       StatusReason -> (string)
          A  description  of  the  change  set's  status. For example, if your
          attempt to create a change  set  failed,  CloudFormation  shows  the
          error message.

       NotificationARNs -> (list)
          The ARNs of the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) top-
          ics that will be associated with the stack if you execute the change
          set.

          (string)

       RollbackConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  rollback  triggers  for  CloudFormation to monitor during stack
          creation and updating operations, and for the  specified  monitoring
          period afterwards.

          RollbackTriggers -> (list)
              The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.

              By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified
              for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations
              for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you  do  specify
              rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any
              list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

              o To  use  the  rollback  triggers previously specified for this
                stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.

              o To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must  specify
                all the triggers that you want used for this stack, even trig-
                gers you've specifed before (for example,  when  creating  the
                stack  or  during  a previous stack update). Any triggers that
                you don't include in the  updated  list  of  triggers  are  no
                longer applied to the stack.

              o To  remove  all currently specified triggers, specify an empty
                list for this parameter.

              If a specified trigger is missing, the  entire  stack  operation
              fails and is rolled back.

              (structure)
                 A  rollback  trigger  CloudFormation monitors during creation
                 and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes
                 to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the spec-
                 ified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back
                 the entire stack operation.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                     If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack oper-
                     ation fails and is rolled back.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The resource type of the rollback trigger. Specify either
                     AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm or AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm
                     resource types.

          MonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
              The amount of time,  in  minutes,  during  which  CloudFormation
              should  monitor  all  the rollback triggers after the stack cre-
              ation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

              The default is 0 minutes.

              If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any  roll-
              back  triggers,  CloudFormation still waits the specified period
              of time before cleaning up old  resources  after  update  opera-
              tions.  You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual
              stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation
              or  update (using CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.

              If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still  moni-
              tors  the  specified rollback triggers during stack creation and
              update operations. Then, for update operations, it  begins  dis-
              posing  of  old  resources  immediately  once the operation com-
              pletes.

       Capabilities -> (list)
          If you execute the change set, the list of  capabilities  that  were
          explicitly acknowledged when the change set was created.

          (string)

       Tags -> (list)
          If you execute the change set, the tags that will be associated with
          the stack.

          (structure)
              The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be
              used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required  . A string used to identify this tag. You can spec-
                 ify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned  by
                 Amazon  Web  Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved
                 prefix: aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 Required . A string containing the value for  this  tag.  You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

       Changes -> (list)
          A list of Change structures that describes the resources CloudForma-
          tion changes if you execute the change set.

          (structure)
              The Change structure describes the changes  CloudFormation  will
              perform if you execute the change set.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  entity that CloudFormation changes. Currently,
                 the only entity type is Resource .

              ResourceChange -> (structure)
                 A ResourceChange structure that describes  the  resource  and
                 action that CloudFormation will perform.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The  action  that  CloudFormation  takes on the resource,
                     such as Add (adds a  new  resource),  Modify  (changes  a
                     resource), Remove (deletes a resource), Import (imports a
                     resource), or Dynamic (exact action for the resource can-
                     not be determined).

                 LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                     The  resource's  logical  ID,  which  is  defined  in the
                     stack's template.

                 PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
                     The resource's physical  ID  (resource  name).  Resources
                     that  you are adding don't have physical IDs because they
                     haven't been created.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     The   type   of   CloudFormation   resource,   such    as
                     AWS::S3::Bucket .

                 Replacement -> (string)
                     For  the  Modify action, indicates whether CloudFormation
                     will replace the resource  by  creating  a  new  one  and
                     deleting  the old one. This value depends on the value of
                     the RequiresRecreation property in the ResourceTargetDef-
                     inition structure. For example, if the RequiresRecreation
                     field is Always and the  Evaluation  field  is  Static  ,
                     Replacement  is True . If the RequiresRecreation field is
                     Always and the Evaluation field is Dynamic ,  Replacement
                     is Conditionally .

                     If  you  have  multiple  changes with different Requires-
                     Recreation values, the Replacement value depends  on  the
                     change  with  the most impact. A RequiresRecreation value
                     of Always has the most impact, followed by  Conditionally
                     , and then Never .

                 Scope -> (list)
                     For the Modify action, indicates which resource attribute
                     is triggering this  update,  such  as  a  change  in  the
                     resource attribute's Metadata , Properties , or Tags .

                     (string)

                 Details -> (list)
                     For  the  Modify  action,  a list of ResourceChangeDetail
                     structures that describes the changes that CloudFormation
                     will make to the resource.

                     (structure)
                        For   a  resource  with  Modify  as  the  action,  the
                        ResourceChange structure describes the changes  Cloud-
                        Formation will make to that resource.

                        Target -> (structure)
                            A    ResourceTargetDefinition    structure    that
                            describes  the  field  that  CloudFormation   will
                            change and whether the resource will be recreated.

                            Attribute -> (string)
                               Indicates which resource attribute is  trigger-
                               ing  this  update,  such  as  a  change  in the
                               resource attribute's Metadata , Properties , or
                               Tags .

                            Name -> (string)
                               If the Attribute value is Properties , the name
                               of the property. For all other attributes,  the
                               value is null.

                            RequiresRecreation -> (string)
                               If  the  Attribute  value is Properties , indi-
                               cates whether a change to this property  causes
                               the  resource to be recreated. The value can be
                               Never , Always , or Conditionally .  To  deter-
                               mine  the conditions for a Conditionally recre-
                               ation,  see  the  update  behavior   for   that
                               property in the CloudFormation User Guide.

                        Evaluation -> (string)
                            Indicates whether CloudFormation can determine the
                            target value, and whether the  target  value  will
                            change before you execute a change set.

                            For  Static evaluations, CloudFormation can deter-
                            mine that the target value will  change,  and  its
                            value.  For  example,  if  you directly modify the
                            InstanceType property of an EC2  instance,  Cloud-
                            Formation  knows  that  this  property  value will
                            change, and its value, so this is a Static evalua-
                            tion.

                            For Dynamic evaluations, cannot determine the tar-
                            get value because it depends on the result  of  an
                            intrinsic  function,  such  as a Ref or Fn::GetAtt
                            intrinsic function, when the stack is updated. For
                            example,  if your template includes a reference to
                            a resource that is  conditionally  recreated,  the
                            value  of  the  reference  (the physical ID of the
                            resource)  might  change,  depending  on  if   the
                            resource  is  recreated. If the resource is recre-
                            ated, it will have a new physical ID, so all  ref-
                            erences to that resource will also be updated.

                        ChangeSource -> (string)
                            The   group   to  which  the  CausingEntity  value
                            belongs. There are five entity groups:

                            o ResourceReference  entities  are  Ref  intrinsic
                              functions  that  refer  to resources in the tem-
                              plate, such as { "Ref" : "MyEC2InstanceResource"
                              } .

                            o ParameterReference  entities  are  Ref intrinsic
                              functions that get  template  parameter  values,
                              such as { "Ref" : "MyPasswordParameter" } .

                            o ResourceAttribute    entities   are   Fn::GetAtt
                              intrinsic functions that get resource  attribute
                              values,    such    as   {   "Fn::GetAtt"   :   [
                              "MyEC2InstanceResource", "PublicDnsName" ] } .

                            o DirectModification entities are changes that are
                              made directly to the template.

                            o Automatic    entities    are    AWS::CloudForma-
                              tion::Stack resource types, which are also known
                              as  nested stacks. If you made no changes to the
                              AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource, CloudForma-
                              tion  sets the ChangeSource to Automatic because
                              the nested stack's template might have  changed.
                              Changes to a nested stack's template aren't vis-
                              ible to CloudFormation until you run  an  update
                              on the parent stack.

                        CausingEntity -> (string)
                            The  identity  of  the  entity that triggered this
                            change. This entity is a member of the group  that
                            is  specified by the ChangeSource field. For exam-
                            ple, if you modified the value of the  KeyPairName
                            parameter,  the  CausingEntity  is the name of the
                            parameter (KeyPairName ).

                            If the ChangeSource value is DirectModification  ,
                            no value is given for CausingEntity .

                 ChangeSetId -> (string)
                     The change set ID of the nested change set.

                 ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                     Contains  information  about  the  module  from which the
                     resource was created, if the resource was created from  a
                     module included in the stack template.

                     TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                        A  concantenated  list of the the module type or types
                        containing  the  resource.  Module  types  are  listed
                        starting  with the inner-most nested module, and sepa-
                        rated by / .

                        In the following example,  the  resource  was  created
                        from  a  module  of type AWS::First::Example::MODULE ,
                        that  is  nested  inside  a  parent  module  of   type
                        AWS::Second::Example::MODULE .
                            AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Exam-
                            ple::MODULE

                     LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                        A concantenated list of the logical IDs of the  module
                        or modules containing the resource. Modules are listed
                        starting with the inner-most nested module, and  sepa-
                        rated by / .

                        In  the  following  example,  the resource was created
                        from a module, moduleA , that is nested inside a  par-
                        ent module, moduleB .
                            moduleA/moduleB

                        module in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the output exceeds 1 MB, a string that identifies the  next  page
          of changes. If there is no additional page, this value is null.

       IncludeNestedStacks -> (boolean)
          Verifies if IncludeNestedStacks is set to True .

       ParentChangeSetId -> (string)
          Specifies  the change set ID of the parent change set in the current
          nested change set hierarchy.

       RootChangeSetId -> (string)
          Specifies the change set ID of the root change set  in  the  current
          nested change set hierarchy.
