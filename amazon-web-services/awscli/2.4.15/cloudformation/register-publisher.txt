SYNOPSIS
            register-publisher
          [--accept-terms-and-conditions | --no-accept-terms-and-conditions]
          [--connection-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-terms-and-conditions    |     --no-accept-terms-and-conditions
       (boolean)
          Whether  you  accept  the Terms and Conditions for publishing exten-
          sions in the CloudFormation registry. You must accept the terms  and
          conditions  in order to register to publish public extensions to the
          CloudFormation registry.

          The default is false .

       --connection-arn (string)
          If you are using a Bitbucket or GitHub account for identity  verifi-
          cation,  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your connection to that
          account.

          For more information, see Registering your account to publish Cloud-
          Formation extensions in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
