SYNOPSIS
            list-type-versions
          [--type <value>]
          [--type-name <value>]
          [--arn <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--deprecated-status <value>]
          [--publisher-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The kind of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

       --type-name (string)
          The  name of the extension for which you want version summary infor-
          mation.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension for which  you  want
          version summary information.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If
          the number of available results exceeds this maximum,  the  response
          includes  a  NextToken  value  that  you can assign to the NextToken
          request parameter to get the next set of results.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining
          results, the response object's NextToken parameter value is set to a
          token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this  action  again
          and  assign  that token to the request object's NextToken parameter.
          If there are no remaining results, the  previous  response  object's
          NextToken parameter is set to null .

       --deprecated-status (string)
          The  deprecation  status  of the extension versions that you want to
          get summary information about.

          Valid values include:

          o LIVE : The extension version is registered  and  can  be  used  in
            CloudFormation  operations, dependent on its provisioning behavior
            and visibility scope.

          o DEPRECATED : The extension version has been deregistered  and  can
            no longer be used in CloudFormation operations.

          The default is LIVE .

          Possible values:

          o LIVE

          o DEPRECATED

       --publisher-id (string)
          The publisher ID of the extension publisher.

          Extensions published by Amazon are not assigned a publisher ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list an extension's version

       The  following  list-type-versions  example returns summary information
       about the versions of an extension.

          aws cloudformation list-type-versions \
            --endpoint https://example.com \
            --region us-west-2 \
            --type RESOURCE \
            --type-name My::Resource::Example \
            --publisher-id 123456789012

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Using the AWS CloudFormation registry in  the
       AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

OUTPUT
       TypeVersionSummaries -> (list)
          A  list  of  TypeVersionSummary  structures that contain information
          about the specified extension's versions.

          (structure)
              Contains summary information  about  a  specific  version  of  a
              CloudFormation extension.

              Type -> (string)
                 The kind of extension.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the extension.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The ID of a specific version of the extension. The version ID
                 is the value at the end of the  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)
                 assigned to the extension version when it is registered.

              IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Whether the specified extension version is set as the default
                 version.

                 This applies only to private extensions you  have  registered
                 in your account, and extensions published by Amazon. For pub-
                 lic third-party extensions, whether or not they are activated
                 in your account, CloudFormation returns null .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension version.

              TimeCreated -> (timestamp)
                 When the version was registered.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the extension version.

              PublicVersionNumber -> (string)
                 For  public  extensions  that  have  been  activated for this
                 account and region, the version of the public extension to be
                 used  for  CloudFormation  operations  in  this  account  and
                 region. For any extensions other  than  activated  third-arty
                 extensions, CloudFormation returns null .

                 How  you  specified  AutoUpdate  when  enabling the extension
                 affects  whether  CloudFormation  automatically  updates  the
                 extention  in  this  account and region when a new version is
                 released. For more information, see Setting CloudFormation to
                 automatically use new versions of extensions in the CloudFor-
                 mation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all of the remaining results,  NextTo-
          ken  is  set  to  a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call
          this action again and assign that  token  to  the  request  object's
          NextToken  parameter.  If the request returns all results, NextToken
          is set to null .
