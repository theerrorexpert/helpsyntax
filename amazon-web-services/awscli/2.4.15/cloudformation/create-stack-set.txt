OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name to associate with the stack set. The name must be unique in
          the Region where you create your stack set.

          NOTE:
              A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case-sen-
              sitive)  and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character
              and can't be longer than 128 characters.

       --description (string)
          A description of the stack set. You can use the description to iden-
          tify the stack set's purpose or other important information.

       --template-body (string)
          The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length
          of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes.  For  more  informa-
          tion, see Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide.

          Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the Templa-
          teURL parameter, but not both.

       --template-url (string)
          The location of the file that contains the template  body.  The  URL
          must  point  to  a  template  (maximum  size:  460,800 bytes) that's
          located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems  Manager  document.  For
          more  information,  see  Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User
          Guide.

          Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the Templa-
          teURL parameter, but not both.

       --stack-id (string)
          The  stack  ID  you  are importing into a new stack set. Specify the
          Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the stack.

       --parameters (list)
          The input parameters for the stack set template.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that is specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During a stack update, use the existing parameter value  that
                 the  stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. Read-only. The value that  corresponds  to  a  SSM
                 parameter  key.  This  field  is  returned  only  for  `  SSM
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types`__
                 parameter types in the template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ParameterKey=string,ParameterValue=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean,ResolvedValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ParameterKey": "string",
              "ParameterValue": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false,
              "ResolvedValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --capabilities (list)
          In  some  cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack set
          template contains certain capabilities in order  for  CloudFormation
          to create the stack set and related stack instances.

          o CAPABILITY_IAM  and  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM    Some  stack templates
            might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon
            Web  Services  account;  for example, by creating new Identity and
            Access Management (IAM) users. For  those  stack  sets,  you  must
            explicitly  acknowledge  this by specifying one of these capabili-
            ties. The following IAM resources require you  to  specify  either
            the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.

            o If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

            o If  you  have  IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
              CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM .

            o If you don't specify either of these  capabilities,  CloudForma-
              tion returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

          If  your  stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
          you review all permissions associated with them and edit their  per-
          missions if necessary.

              o AWS::IAM::AccessKey

              o AWS::IAM::Group

              o AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile

              o AWS::IAM::Policy

              o AWS::IAM::Role

              o AWS::IAM::User

              o AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition

          For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudForma-
          tion Templates .

          o CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND   Some templates reference macros. If  your
            stack  set template references one or more macros, you must create
            the stack set directly from the processed template, without  first
            reviewing  the  resulting  changes  in a change set. To create the
            stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more
            information,  see  Using  CloudFormation  Macros to Perform Custom
            Processing on Templates .

          WARNING:
              Stack sets with service-managed  permissions  do  not  currently
              support  the  use  of  macros  in  templates. (This includes the
              AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms,  which  are  macros
              hosted  by  CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability
              for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if you  refer-
              ence a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CAPABILITY_IAM
            CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
            CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the  stacks
          created  from  it. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to sup-
          ported resources that are created in the stacks. A maximum number of
          50 tags can be specified.

          If  you specify tags as part of a CreateStackSet action, CloudForma-
          tion checks to see if you have the required IAM  permission  to  tag
          resources. If you don't, the entire CreateStackSet action fails with
          an access denied error, and the stack set is not created.

          (structure)
              The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be
              used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required  . A string used to identify this tag. You can spec-
                 ify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned  by
                 Amazon  Web  Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved
                 prefix: aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 Required . A string containing the value for  this  tag.  You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --administration-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Number (ARN) of the IAM role to use to create
          this stack set.

          Specify an IAM role only if you are using  customized  administrator
          roles  to  control  which  users or groups can manage specific stack
          sets within the same administrator account.  For  more  information,
          see  Prerequisites: Granting Permissions for Stack Set Operations in
          the CloudFormation User Guide .

       --execution-role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM execution role to use to create the  stack  set.
          If  you  do  not  specify an execution role, CloudFormation uses the
          AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set opera-
          tion.

          Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles
          to control which stack resources users and  groups  can  include  in
          their stack sets.

       --permission-model (string)
          Describes  how  the  IAM roles required for stack set operations are
          created. By default, SELF-MANAGED is specified.

          o With self-managed permissions, you must create  the  administrator
            and  execution  roles  required  to deploy to target accounts. For
            more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions .

          o With service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically  creates
            the  IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by Organiza-
            tions. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed  Stack  Set
            Permissions .

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_MANAGED

          o SELF_MANAGED

       --auto-deployment (structure)
          Describes  whether  StackSets automatically deploys to Organizations
          accounts that are added to the target organization or organizational
          unit (OU). Specify only if PermissionModel is SERVICE_MANAGED .

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              If  set  to  true  ,  StackSets automatically deploys additional
              stack instances to Organizations accounts that are  added  to  a
              target organization or organizational unit (OU) in the specified
              Regions. If an account is removed from a target organization  or
              OU,  StackSets  deletes  stack instances from the account in the
              specified Regions.

          RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval -> (boolean)
              If set to true , stack resources are retained when an account is
              removed  from  a  target  organization  or OU. If set to false ,
              stack resources are deleted. Specify only if Enabled is  set  to
              True .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval": true|false
          }

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o To create a  stack  set  with  service-managed  permissions  while
            signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o To  create  a  stack  set  with  service-managed permissions while
            signed in to a  delegated  administrator  account,  specify  DELE-
            GATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered
            as a delegated admin in the management account. For more  informa-
            tion, see Register a delegated administrator in the CloudFormation
            User Guide .

          Stack sets with service-managed permissions are created in the  man-
          agement  account, including stack sets that are created by delegated
          administrators.

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this CreateStackSet  request.  Specify  this
          token  if  you  plan  to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows
          that you're not attempting to create another stack set with the same
          name.  You might retry CreateStackSet requests to ensure that Cloud-
          Formation successfully received them.

          If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automat-
          ically.

       --managed-execution (structure)
          Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations con-
          currently and queues conflicting operations.

          Active -> (boolean)
              When true , StackSets performs non-conflicting  operations  con-
              currently  and  queues conflicting operations. After conflicting
              operations finish, StackSets starts queued operations in request
              order.

              NOTE:
                 If  there are already running or queued operations, StackSets
                 queues all incoming operations even if they are non-conflict-
                 ing.

                 You  can't  modify  your  stack set's execution configuration
                 while there are running or queued operations for  that  stack
                 set.

              When false (default), StackSets performs one operation at a time
              in request order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Active=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Active": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a stack set

       The following create-stack-set example creates a stack  set  using  the
       specified  YAML  file temlplate. template.yaml is an AWS CloudFormation
       template in the current folder that defines a stack.

          aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
              --stack-set-name my-stack-set \
              --template-body file://template.yaml \
              --description "SNS topic"

       Output:

          {
              "StackSetId": "my-stack-set:8d0f160b-d157-xmpl-a8e6-c0ce8e5d8cc1"
          }

       To add stack instances to the stack set, use the create-stack-instances
       command.

OUTPUT
       StackSetId -> (string)
          The ID of the stack set that you're creating.
