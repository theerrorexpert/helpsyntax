NAME
       describe-stack-resource-drifts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  drift information for the resources that have been checked for
       drift in the specified stack. This includes actual and expected config-
       uration values for resources where CloudFormation detects configuration
       drift.

       For a given stack, there will be one StackResourceDrift for each  stack
       resource  that  has  been checked for drift. Resources that haven't yet
       been checked for drift are not included. Resources  that  do  not  cur-
       rently  support  drift  detection are not checked, and so not included.
       For a list of resources that support  drift  detection,  see  Resources
       that Support Drift Detection .

       Use   DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual resources,
       or  DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all supported resources  for  a
       given stack.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-resource-drifts
          --stack-name <value>
          [--stack-resource-drift-status-filters <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack for which you want drift information.

       --stack-resource-drift-status-filters (list)
          The  resource drift status values to use as filters for the resource
          drift results returned.

          o DELETED : The resource differs from its expected template configu-
            ration in that the resource has been deleted.

          o MODIFIED  :  One  or  more  resource  properties differ from their
            expected template values.

          o IN_SYNC  :  The  resources's  actual  configuration  matches   its
            expected template configuration.

          o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation does not currently return this value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            IN_SYNC
            MODIFIED
            DELETED
            NOT_CHECKED

       --next-token (string)
          A string that identifies the  next  page  of  stack  resource  drift
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If
          the number of available results exceeds this maximum,  the  response
          includes  a  NextToken  value  that  you can assign to the NextToken
          request parameter to get the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about resources that drifted from the stack  defini-
       tion

       The  following command displays information about drifted resources for
       the  specified  stack.   To   initiate   drift   detection,   use   the
       detect-stack-drift command.:

          aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource-drifts \
              --stack-name my-stack

       The output shows an AWS Lambda function that was modified out-of-band:

OUTPUT
       StackResourceDrifts -> (list)
          Drift information for the resources that have been checked for drift
          in the specified stack. This includes actual and expected configura-
          tion values for resources where CloudFormation detects drift.

          For  a  given  stack,  there will be one StackResourceDrift for each
          stack resource that has been checked for drift. Resources that  have
          not  yet  been checked for drift are not included. Resources that do
          not currently support drift detection are not checked,  and  so  not
          included.  For a list of resources that support drift detection, see
          Resources that Support Drift Detection .

          (structure)
              Contains the drift information for  a  resource  that  has  been
              checked  for  drift.  This includes actual and expected property
              values for resources in which CloudFormation has detected drift.
              Only  resource  properties  explicitly defined in the stack tem-
              plate are checked for drift. For more information, see Detecting
              Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

              Resources  that  do not currently support drift detection cannot
              be checked. For a list of resources that  support  drift  detec-
              tion, see Resources that Support Drift Detection .

              Use   DetectStackResourceDrift  to  detect  drift  on individual
              resources, or  DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all resources
              in a given stack that support drift detection.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack.

              LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

              PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The  name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical
                 instance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.

              PhysicalResourceIdContext -> (list)
                 Context information that enables CloudFormation  to  uniquely
                 identify  a  resource.  CloudFormation uses context key-value
                 pairs in cases where a resource's logical  and  physical  IDs
                 are  not enough to uniquely identify that resource. Each con-
                 text key-value pair specifies a unique resource that contains
                 the targeted resource.

                 (structure)
                     Context   information   that  enables  CloudFormation  to
                     uniquely identify a resource. CloudFormation uses context
                     key-value  pairs  in cases where a resource's logical and
                     physical IDs are not enough  to  uniquely  identify  that
                     resource.   Each   context  key-value  pair  specifies  a
                     resource that contains the targeted resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The resource context key.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The resource context value.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource.

              ExpectedProperties -> (string)
                 A JSON structure containing the expected property  values  of
                 the  stack resource, as defined in the stack template and any
                 values specified as template parameters.

                 For resources whose  StackResourceDriftStatus  is  DELETED  ,
                 this structure will not be present.

              ActualProperties -> (string)
                 A JSON structure containing the actual property values of the
                 stack resource.

                 For resources whose  StackResourceDriftStatus  is  DELETED  ,
                 this structure will not be present.

              PropertyDifferences -> (list)
                 A  collection  of the resource properties whose actual values
                 differ from their expected values. These will be present only
                 for resources whose StackResourceDriftStatus is MODIFIED .

                 (structure)
                     Information  about a resource property whose actual value
                     differs from its expected value, as defined in the  stack
                     template and any values specified as template parameters.
                     These will be present only for resources  whose  StackRe-
                     sourceDriftStatus is MODIFIED . For more information, see
                     Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and
                     Resources .

                     PropertyPath -> (string)

                     ExpectedValue -> (string)
                        The  expected property value of the resource property,
                        as defined in the stack template and any values speci-
                        fied as template parameters.

                     ActualValue -> (string)
                        The actual property value of the resource property.

                     DifferenceType -> (string)
                        The type of property difference.

                        o ADD  : A value has been added to a resource property
                          that is an array or list data type.

                        o REMOVE : The property has been removed from the cur-
                          rent resource configuration.

                        o NOT_EQUAL  : The current property value differs from
                          its expected value (as defined in the stack template
                          and any values specified as template parameters).

              StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to its
                 expected configuration

                 o DELETED : The resource differs from its  expected  template
                   configuration because the resource has been deleted.

                 o MODIFIED  :  One  or  more  resource properties differ from
                   their expected values (as defined in the stack template and
                   any values specified as template parameters).

                 o IN_SYNC  : The resources's actual configuration matches its
                   expected template configuration.

                 o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation does not currently return this
                   value.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Time at which CloudFormation performed drift detection on the
                 stack resource.

              ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the module from which the resource
                 was  created,  if  the  resource  was  created  from a module
                 included in the stack template.

                 TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                     A concantenated list of the the module type or types con-
                     taining  the  resource.  Module types are listed starting
                     with the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module  of  type  AWS::First::Example::MODULE  ,  that is
                     nested inside a parent module of type  AWS::Second::Exam-
                     ple::MODULE .
                        AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MOD-
                        ULE

                 LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                     A concantenated list of the logical IDs of the module  or
                     modules  containing  the  resource.  Modules  are  listed
                     starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated
                     by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module, moduleA , that is nested inside a parent  module,
                     moduleB .
                        moduleA/moduleB

                     For more information, see Referencing resources in a mod-
                     ule in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all of the remaining results,  NextTo-
          ken  is  set  to  a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call
          DescribeStackResourceDrifts again  and  assign  that  token  to  the
          request  object's  NextToken  parameter.  If the request returns all
          results, NextToken is set to null .
