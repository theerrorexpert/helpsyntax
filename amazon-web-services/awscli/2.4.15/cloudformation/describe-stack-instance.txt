NAME
       describe-stack-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  stack instance that's associated with the specified stack
       set, Amazon Web Services account, and Region.

       For a list of stack instances that are associated with a specific stack
       set, use  ListStackInstances .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-instance
          --stack-set-name <value>
          --stack-instance-account <value>
          --stack-instance-region <value>
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  or  the unique stack ID of the stack set that you want to
          get stack instance information for.

       --stack-instance-account (string)
          The ID of an Amazon Web Services account that's associated with this
          stack instance.

       --stack-instance-region (string)
          The name of a Region that's associated with this stack instance.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a stack instance

       The following command describes an instance of the specified stack  set
       in  the  specified  account and Region. The stack set is in the current
       region and account, and the instance is  in  the  us-west-2  region  in
       account 123456789012.:

              is associated with.

          Region -> (string)
              The name of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region  that  the  stack
              instance is associated with.

          Account -> (string)
              [Self-managed  permissions]  The name of the Amazon Web Services
              account that the stack instance is associated with.

          StackId -> (string)

          ParameterOverrides -> (list)
              A list of parameters from the stack set  template  whose  values
              have been overridden in this stack instance.

              (structure)
                 The Parameter data type.

                 ParameterKey -> (string)
                     The key associated with the parameter. If you don't spec-
                     ify a key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFor-
                     mation  uses  the default value that is specified in your
                     template.

                 ParameterValue -> (string)
                     The input value associated with the parameter.

                 UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                     During a stack update, use the existing  parameter  value
                     that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you
                     specify true , do not specify a parameter value.

                 ResolvedValue -> (string)
                     Read-only. Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM
                     parameter  key.  This  field  is  returned only for ` SSM
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types`__
                     parameter types in the template.

          Status -> (string)
              The  status  of the stack instance, in terms of its synchroniza-
              tion with its associated stack set.

              o INOPERABLE : A DeleteStackInstances operation has  failed  and
                left  the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are
                excluded from further  UpdateStackSet  operations.  You  might
                need to perform a DeleteStackInstances operation, with Retain-
                Stacks set to true , to delete the stack  instance,  and  then
                delete the stack manually.

              o OUTDATED : The stack isn't currently up to date with the stack
                set because:

                o The associated  stack  failed  during  a  CreateStackSet  or
                  UpdateStackSet operation.

                o The  stack  was  part  of a CreateStackSet or UpdateStackSet
                  operation that failed or was stopped before  the  stack  was
                  created or updated.

              o CURRENT  :  The  stack  is currently up to date with the stack
                set.

          StackInstanceStatus -> (structure)
              The detailed status of the stack instance.

              DetailedStatus -> (string)

                 o CANCELLED : The operation  in  the  specified  account  and
                   Region  has  been  cancelled. This is either because a user
                   has stopped the stack set operation, or because the failure
                   tolerance of the stack set operation has been exceeded.

                 o FAILED  : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   failed. If the stack set operation fails in enough accounts
                   within  a  Region,  the failure tolerance for the stack set
                   operation as a whole might be exceeded.

                 o INOPERABLE : A DeleteStackInstances  operation  has  failed
                   and  left  the  stack  in an unstable state. Stacks in this
                   state are excluded from further UpdateStackSet  operations.
                   You might need to perform a DeleteStackInstances operation,
                   with RetainStacks  set  to  true  ,  to  delete  the  stack
                   instance, and then delete the stack manually.

                 o PENDING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   has yet to start.

                 o RUNNING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   is currently in progress.

                 o SUCCEEDED  :  The  operation  in  the specified account and
                   Region completed successfully.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              The explanation for the specific status code that is assigned to
              this stack instance.

          OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
              [Service-managed  permissions] The organization root ID or orga-
              nizational   unit   (OU)   IDs   that    you    specified    for
              DeploymentTargets .

          DriftStatus -> (string)
              Status  of the stack instance's actual configuration compared to
              the expected template and parameter configuration of  the  stack
              set to which it belongs.

              o DRIFTED  :  The  stack  differs from the expected template and
                parameter configuration of the stack set to which it  belongs.
                A  stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more
                of the resources in the associated stack have drifted.

              o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation has  not  checked  if  the  stack
                instance differs from its expected stack set configuration.

              o IN_SYNC  :  The  stack instance's actual configuration matches
                its expected stack set configuration.

              o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

          LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detection
              operation on the stack instance. This value will be NULL for any
              stack instance on which drift detection has not  yet  been  per-
              formed.
