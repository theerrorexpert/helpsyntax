IMPORT-STACKS-TO-STACK-SET()                      IMPORT-STACKS-TO-STACK-SET()



NAME
       import-stacks-to-stack-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  the  stack  import  operations for self-managed or service-managed
       StackSets. For self-managed StackSets, the import operation can  import
       stacks in the administrator account or in different target accounts and
       Amazon Web Services Regions. For service-managed StackSets, the  import
       operation  can  import  any  stack in the same AWS Organizations as the
       management account. The import operation can import  up  to  10  stacks
       using  inline  stack  IDs  or  up  to  10,000 stacks using an Amazon S3
       object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name of the stack set. The name must be  unique  in  the  Region
          where you create your stack set.

       --stack-ids (list)
          The IDs of the stacks you are importing into a stack set. You import
          up to 10 stacks per stack set at a time.

          Specify either StackIds or StackIdsUrl .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --stack-ids-url (string)
          The Amazon S3 URL which contains list of stack ids to be inputted.

          Specify either StackIds or StackIdsUrl .

       --organizational-unit-ids (list)
          The list of OU IDs to which the stacks  being  imported  has  to  be
          mapped as deployment target.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          The  user-specified  preferences  for  how CloudFormation performs a
          stack set operation.

          For more information on maximum concurrent accounts and failure tol-
          erance, see Stack set operation options .

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The  concurrency  type  of  deploying  StackSets  operations  in
              Regions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The order of the Regions in where you want to perform the  stack
              operation.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in  that  Region.
              If  the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The  percentage  of  accounts,  per Region, for which this stack
              operation can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation  in
              that  Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent  Regions.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of accounts in which to perform  this  opera-
              tion  at one time. This is dependent on the value of FailureTol-
              eranceCount . MaxConcurrentCount is at most one  more  than  the
              FailureToleranceCount .

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The  maximum  percentage  of  accounts  in which to perform this
              operation at one time.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero.  In  this  case,  CloudFormation  sets  the  number as one
              instead.

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],
            "FailureToleranceCount": integer,
            "FailureTolerancePercentage": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentCount": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentPercentage": integer
          }

       --operation-id (string)
          A unique, user defined, identifier for the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o For service managed stack sets, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the stack set operation.
