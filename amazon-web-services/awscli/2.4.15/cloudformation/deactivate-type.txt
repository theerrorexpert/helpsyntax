DEACTIVATE-TYPE()                                            DEACTIVATE-TYPE()



NAME
       deactivate-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Deactivates  a  public  extension that was previously activated in this
       account and region.

       Once deactivated, an extension cannot be  used  in  any  CloudFormation
       operation.  This  includes stack update operations where the stack tem-
       plate includes the extension, even if no updates are being made to  the
       extension.  In  addition,  deactivated extensions are not automatically
       updated if a new version of the extension is released.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deactivate-type
          [--type-name <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The type name of the extension, in this account and region.  If  you
          specified  a  type  name  alias when enabling the extension, use the
          type name alias.

          Conditional: You must specify either Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --type (string)
          The extension type.

          Conditional: You must specify either Arn , or TypeName and Type .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the extension,  in  this  account
          and region.

          Conditional: You must specify either Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To deactivate a type

       The  following  deactivate-type  example deactivates a public extension

              --type MODULE \
              --type-name Example::Test::Type::MODULE

       This command produces no output.
