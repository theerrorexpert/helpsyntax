DESCRIBE-STACK-RESOURCE()                            DESCRIBE-STACK-RESOURCE()



NAME
       describe-stack-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a description of the specified resource in the specified stack.

       For deleted stacks, DescribeStackResource returns resource  information
       for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-resource
          --stack-name <value>
          --logical-resource-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name  or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack,
          which are not always interchangeable:

          o Running stacks: You can specify either the  stack's  name  or  its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --logical-resource-id (string)
          The logical name of the resource as specified in the template.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a stack resource

       The  following describe-stack-resource example displays details for the
       resource named MyFunction in the specified stack.

          aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource \
              --stack-name MyStack \
              --logical-resource-id MyFunction

              vices  Resource  Types  Reference  in  the  CloudFormation  User
              Guide.)

              For  more information, see Metadata Attribute in the CloudForma-
              tion User Guide.

          DriftInformation -> (structure)
              Information about whether the  resource's  actual  configuration
              differs,  or  has  drifted , from its expected configuration, as
              defined in the stack template and any values specified  as  tem-
              plate  parameters.  For  more information, see Detecting Unregu-
              lated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

              StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to its
                 expected configuration

                 o DELETED : The resource differs from its expected configura-
                   tion in that it has been deleted.

                 o MODIFIED : The resource differs from its expected  configu-
                   ration.

                 o NOT_CHECKED   :  CloudFormation  has  not  checked  if  the
                   resource  differs  from  its  expected  configuration.  Any
                   resources  that  do  not  currently support drift detection
                   have a status of NOT_CHECKED . For  more  information,  see
                   Resources that Support Drift Detection .

                 o IN_SYNC  : The resources's actual configuration matches its
                   expected configuration.

              LastCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 When CloudFormation last checked if the resource had  drifted
                 from its expected configuration.

          ModuleInfo -> (structure)
              Contains  information  about  the module from which the resource
              was created, if the resource was created from a module  included
              in the stack template.

              TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                 A concantenated list of the the module type or types contain-
                 ing the resource. Module types are listed starting  with  the
                 inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                 In  the  following  example,  the resource was created from a
                 module of type AWS::First::Example::MODULE , that  is  nested
                 inside a parent module of type AWS::Second::Example::MODULE .
                     AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MODULE

              LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                 A concantenated list of the logical IDs of the module or mod-
                 ules  containing  the  resource.  Modules are listed starting
                 with the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                 In the following example, the resource  was  created  from  a
                 module, moduleA , that is nested inside a parent module, mod-
                 uleB .
                     moduleA/moduleB

                 in the CloudFormation User Guide .
