NAME
       describe-stack-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the description of the specified stack set.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-set
          --stack-set-name <value>
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set whose description you want.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              groups  can  manage specific stack sets within the same adminis-
              trator account. For more information, see Prerequisites:  Grant-
              ing  Permissions  for Stack Set Operations in the CloudFormation
              User Guide .

              The name of the IAM execution role used to create or update  the
              stack set.

              Use  customized execution roles to control which stack resources
              users and groups can include in their stack sets.

          StackSetDriftDetectionDetails -> (structure)
              Detailed information about the drift status of the stack set.

              For stack sets, contains information about  the  last  completed
              drift  operation  performed  on the stack set. Information about
              drift operations currently in progress is not included.

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status of the stack set's actual  configuration  compared  to
                 its  expected  template  and parameter configuration. A stack
                 set is considered to have drifted if one or more of its stack
                 instances  have  drifted  from  their  expected  template and
                 parameter configuration.

                 o DRIFTED : One or more of the stack instances  belonging  to
                   the  stack set stack differs from the expected template and
                   parameter configuration. A stack instance is considered  to
                   have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associ-
                   ated stack have drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation has not checked the stack  set
                   for drift.

                 o IN_SYNC : All of the stack instances belonging to the stack
                   set stack match from the expected  template  and  parameter
                   configuration.

              DriftDetectionStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the stack set drift detection operation.

                 o COMPLETED : The drift detection operation completed without
                   failing on any stack instances.

                 o FAILED : The drift detection operation exceeded the  speci-
                   fied failure tolerance.

                 o PARTIAL_SUCCESS  :  The drift detection operation completed
                   without exceeding the failure tolerance for the  operation.

                 o IN_PROGRESS  :  The  drift detection operation is currently
                   being performed.

                 o STOPPED : The user has cancelled the drift detection opera-
                   tion.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion operation on the stack set. This value will be NULL  for
                 any  stack set on which drift detection has not yet been per-
                 formed.

              TotalStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of stack instances belonging to  this  stack
                 set.

                 The total number of stack instances is equal to the total of:

                 o Stack instances that match the stack set configuration.

                 o Stack instances that have drifted from the stack  set  con-
                   figuration.

                 o Stack  instances  where  the  drift detection operation has
                   failed.

                 o Stack instances currently being checked for drift.

              DriftedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The number of stack instances  that  have  drifted  from  the
                 expected  template  and  parameter configuration of the stack
                 set. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or
                 more  of  the  resources in the associated stack do not match
                 their expected configuration.

              InSyncStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The number of stack instances which match the  expected  tem-
                 plate and parameter configuration of the stack set.

              InProgressStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  stack  instances  that  are  currently being
                 checked for drift.

              FailedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The number of stack instances for which the  drift  detection
                 operation failed.

          AutoDeployment -> (structure)
              [Service-managed  permissions] Describes whether StackSets auto-
              matically deploys to Organizations accounts that are added to  a
              target organization or organizational unit (OU).

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 If  set  to true , StackSets automatically deploys additional
                 stack instances to Organizations accounts that are added to a
                 target organization or organizational unit (OU) in the speci-
                 fied Regions. If an account is removed from a target  organi-
                 zation  or  OU,  StackSets  deletes  stack instances from the
                 account in the specified Regions.

              RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval -> (boolean)
                 If set to true , stack resources are retained when an account
                 is  removed from a target organization or OU. If set to false
                 , stack resources are deleted. Specify only if Enabled is set
                 to True .

          PermissionModel -> (string)
              Describes  how  the  IAM roles required for stack set operations
              are created.

              o With self-managed permissions, you must create the administra-
                tor and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts.
                For more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permis-
                sions .

              o With service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically cre-
                ates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts  managed  by
                Organizations. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed
                Stack Set Permissions .

          OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
              [Service-managed permissions] The organization root ID or  orga-
              nizational    unit    (OU)    IDs   that   you   specified   for
              DeploymentTargets .

              (string)

          ManagedExecution -> (structure)
              Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting  operations
              concurrently and queues conflicting operations.

              Active -> (boolean)
                 When  true  ,  StackSets  performs non-conflicting operations
                 concurrently and queues conflicting  operations.  After  con-
                 flicting  operations  finish,  StackSets starts queued opera-
                 tions in request order.

                 NOTE:
                     If there are already running or queued operations, Stack-
                     Sets  queues  all  incoming  operations  even if they are
                     non-conflicting.

                     You can't modify your stack set's execution configuration
                     while  there  are  running  or queued operations for that
                     stack set.

                 When false (default), StackSets performs one operation  at  a
                 time in request order.
