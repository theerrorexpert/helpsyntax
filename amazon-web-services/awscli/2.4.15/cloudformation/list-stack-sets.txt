LIST-STACK-SETS()                                            LIST-STACK-SETS()



NAME
       list-stack-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about stack sets that are associated with
       the user.

       o [Self-managed permissions] If you set the CallAs  parameter  to  SELF
         while  signed  in  to your Amazon Web Services account, ListStackSets
         returns all self-managed stack  sets  in  your  Amazon  Web  Services
         account.

       o [Service-managed permissions] If you set the CallAs parameter to SELF
         while signed in to the organization's management account,  ListStack-
         Sets returns all stack sets in the management account.

       o [Service-managed permissions] If you set the CallAs parameter to DEL-
         EGATED_ADMIN while signed in to your  member  account,  ListStackSets
         returns  all  stack sets with service-managed permissions in the man-
         agement account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stack-sets is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Summaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-stack-sets
          [--status <value>]
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          The  status  of the stack sets that you want to get summary informa-
          tion about.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o DELETED

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account  administrator  in  the management account or as a delegated
          administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          }

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A  list of StackSetSummary structures that contain information about
          the user's stack sets.

          (structure)
              The structures that contain summary information about the speci-
              fied stack set.

              StackSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack set.

              StackSetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack set.

              Description -> (string)
                 A  description  of  the  stack  set that you specify when the
                 stack set is created or updated.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the stack set.

              AutoDeployment -> (structure)
                 [Service-managed  permissions]  Describes  whether  StackSets
                 automatically  deploys  to  Organizations  accounts  that are
                 added to a target organizational unit (OU).

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     If set to true , StackSets  automatically  deploys  addi-
                     tional stack instances to Organizations accounts that are
                     added to a target  organization  or  organizational  unit
                     (OU)  in  the specified Regions. If an account is removed
                     from a target organization or OU, StackSets deletes stack
                     instances from the account in the specified Regions.

                 RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval -> (boolean)
                     If  set  to  true  , stack resources are retained when an
                     account is removed from a target organization or  OU.  If
                     set  to false , stack resources are deleted. Specify only
                     if Enabled is set to True .

              PermissionModel -> (string)
                 Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations
                 are created.

                 o With self-managed permissions, you must create the adminis-
                   trator and execution roles required  to  deploy  to  target
                   accounts.  For  more  information,  see  Grant Self-Managed
                   Stack Set Permissions .

                 o With service-managed permissions,  StackSets  automatically
                   creates  the  IAM roles required to deploy to accounts man-
                   aged by Organizations. For more information, see Grant Ser-
                   vice-Managed Stack Set Permissions .

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status  of  the  stack set's actual configuration compared to
                 its expected template and parameter  configuration.  A  stack
                 set is considered to have drifted if one or more of its stack
                 instances have  drifted  from  their  expected  template  and
                 parameter configuration.

                 o DRIFTED  :  One or more of the stack instances belonging to
                   the stack set stack differs from the expected template  and
                   parameter  configuration. A stack instance is considered to
                   have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associ-
                   ated stack have drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED  : CloudFormation has not checked the stack set
                   for drift.

                 o IN_SYNC : All of the stack instances belonging to the stack
                   set  stack  match  from the expected template and parameter
                   configuration.

                 o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion  operation on the stack set. This value will be NULL for
                 any stack set on which drift detection has not yet been  per-
                 formed.

              ManagedExecution -> (structure)
                 Describes  whether  StackSets performs non-conflicting opera-
                 tions concurrently and queues conflicting operations.

                 Active -> (boolean)
                     When true , StackSets performs non-conflicting operations
                     concurrently  and  queues  conflicting  operations. After
                     conflicting operations finish,  StackSets  starts  queued
                     operations in request order.

                     NOTE:
                        If  there  are  already  running or queued operations,
                        StackSets queues all incoming operations even if  they
                        are non-conflicting.

                        You can't modify your stack set's execution configura-
                        tion while there are running or queued operations  for
                        that stack set.

                     When false (default), StackSets performs one operation at
                     a time in request order.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all of the remaining results,  NextTo-
          ken  is  set  to  a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call
          ListStackInstances again  and  assign  that  token  to  the  request
          object's  NextToken  parameter.  If the request returns all results,
          NextToken is set to null .
