LIST-STACK-SET-OPERATIONS()                        LIST-STACK-SET-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-stack-set-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary information about operations performed on a stack set.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stack-set-operations is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Summaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-stack-set-operations
          --stack-set-name <value>
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  or unique ID of the stack set that you want to get opera-
          tion summaries for.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following list-stack-set-operations example displays  the  list  of
       the most recent operations on the specified stack set.

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A  list  of StackSetOperationSummary structures that contain summary
          information about operations for the specified stack set.

          (structure)
              The structures that contain summary information about the speci-
              fied operation.

              OperationId -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the stack set operation.

              Action -> (string)
                 The  type  of operation: CREATE , UPDATE , or DELETE . Create
                 and  delete  operations  affect  only  the  specified   stack
                 instances  that  are associated with the specified stack set.
                 Update operations affect both the stack set itself as well as
                 all associated stack set instances.

              Status -> (string)
                 The overall status of the operation.

                 o FAILED  : The operation exceeded the specified failure tol-
                   erance. The failure tolerance value that you've set for  an
                   operation  is  applied  for each Region during stack create
                   and update operations.  If  the  number  of  failed  stacks
                   within  a  Region exceeds the failure tolerance, the status
                   of the operation in the Region is set to FAILED .  This  in
                   turn  sets the status of the operation as a whole to FAILED
                   , and CloudFormation cancels the operation in any remaining
                   Regions.

                 o QUEUED   :   [Service-managed  permissions]  For  automatic
                   deployments that require  a  sequence  of  operations,  the
                   operation  is queued to be performed. For more information,
                   see the stack set operation status codes in the CloudForma-
                   tion User Guide.

                 o RUNNING : The operation is currently being performed.

                 o STOPPED : The user has cancelled the operation.

                 o STOPPING  : The operation is in the process of stopping, at
                   user request.

                 o SUCCEEDED : The operation completed  creating  or  updating
                   all the specified stacks without exceeding the failure tol-
                   erance for the operation.

              CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that  the
                 creation  times for the stack set operation might differ from
                 the creation time of the individual stacks  themselves.  This
                 is  because  CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work
                 for the operation,  such  as  dispatching  the  work  to  the
                 requested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.

              EndTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the stack set operation ended,  across  all
                 accounts and Regions specified. Note that this doesn't neces-
                 sarily mean that the stack set operation was  successful,  or
                 even attempted, in each account or Region.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  request  doesn't  return all results, NextToken is set to a
          token. To retrieve the next set of  results,  call  ListOperationRe-
          sults  again and assign that token to the request object's NextToken
          parameter. If there are no remaining results, NextToken  is  set  to
          null .
