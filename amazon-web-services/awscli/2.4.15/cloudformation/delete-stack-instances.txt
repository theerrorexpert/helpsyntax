          instances for.

       --accounts (list)
          [Self-managed  permissions]  The  names  of  the Amazon Web Services
          accounts that you want to delete stack instances for.

          to delete stack instances.

          You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets , but not both.

          Accounts -> (list)
              The  names of one or more Amazon Web Services accounts for which
              you want to deploy stack set updates.

              Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

          OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
              The organization root ID or  organizational  unit  (OU)  IDs  to
              which StackSets deploys.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accounts=string,string,AccountsUrl=string,OrganizationalUnitIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Accounts": ["string", ...],
            "AccountsUrl": "string",
            "OrganizationalUnitIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --regions (list)
          The Regions where you want to delete stack set instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          Preferences  for  how  CloudFormation performs this stack set opera-
          tion.

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The  concurrency  type  of  deploying  StackSets  operations  in
              Regions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The  order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack
              operation.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail  before  CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region.
              If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation  doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region,  for  which  this  stack
              operation  can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in
              that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region,  CloudFor-
              mation  doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of accounts in which to perform this opera-
              tion at one time. This is dependent on the value of  FailureTol-
              eranceCount  .  MaxConcurrentCount  is at most one more than the
              FailureToleranceCount .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts  in  which  to  perform  this
              operation at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero. In this  case,  CloudFormation  sets  the  number  as  one
              instead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],
            "FailureToleranceCount": integer,
            "FailureTolerancePercentage": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentCount": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentPercentage": integer
          }

       --retain-stacks | --no-retain-stacks (boolean)
          Removes  the  stack  instances  from  the  specified  stack set, but
          doesn't delete the stacks. You can't reassociate a retained stack or
          add an existing, saved stack to a new stack set.

          For more information, see Stack set operation options .

       --operation-id (string)
          The unique identifier for this stack set operation.

          If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automat-
          ically.

          The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token,  to  ensure
          that CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even
          if you retry the request multiple times. You  can  retry  stack  set
          operation   requests  to  ensure  that  CloudFormation  successfully
          received them.

          Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation  ID  retries
          all stack instances whose status is OUTDATED .

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To delete stack instances

       The following delete-stack-instances example  deletes  instances  of  a
       stack set in two accounts in two regions and terminates the stacks.

          aws cloudformation delete-stack-instances \
              --stack-set-name my-stack-set \
              --accounts 123456789012 567890123456 \
              --regions us-east-1 us-west-1 \
              --no-retain-stacks

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "ad49f10c-fd1d-413f-a20a-8de6e2fa8f27"
          }

       To delete an empty stack set, use the delete-stack-set command.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for this stack set operation.
