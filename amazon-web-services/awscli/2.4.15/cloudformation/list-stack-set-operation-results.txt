NAME
       list-stack-set-operation-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns summary information about the results of a stack set operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stack-set-operation-results is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Summaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-stack-set-operation-results
          --stack-set-name <value>
          --operation-id <value>
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  or unique ID of the stack set that you want to get opera-
          tion results for.

       --operation-id (string)
          The ID of the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list stack set operation results

       The following command displays the results of an  update  operation  on
       instances in the specified stack set.

          aws cloudformation list-stack-set-operation-results \
              --stack-set-name enable-config \
              --operation-id 35d45ebc-ed88-xmpl-ab59-0197a1fc83a0

       Output:

          {
              "Summaries": [
                  {
                      "Account": "223456789012",
                      "Region": "us-west-2",
                      "Status": "SUCCEEDED",
                      "AccountGateResult": {
                          "Status": "SKIPPED",
                          "StatusReason": "Function not found: arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:223456789012:function:AWSCloudFormationStackSetAccountGate"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "Account": "223456789012",
                      "Region": "ap-south-1",
                      "Status": "CANCELLED",
                      "StatusReason": "Cancelled since failure tolerance has exceeded"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Note: The SKIPPED status for AccountGateResult is expected for success-
       ful operations unless you create an account gate function.

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A list of  StackSetOperationResultSummary  structures  that  contain
          information  about the specified operation results, for accounts and
          Regions that are included in the operation.

          (structure)
              The structure that contains information about a specified opera-
              tion's results for a given account in a given Region.

              Account -> (string)
                 [Self-managed  permissions]  The  name of the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices account for this operation result.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services Region for this operation
                 result.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  result  status  of the stack set operation for the given
                 account in the given Region.

                 o CANCELLED : The operation  in  the  specified  account  and
                   Region  has  been  cancelled. This is either because a user
                   has stopped the stack set operation, or because the failure
                   tolerance of the stack set operation has been exceeded.

                 o FAILED  : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   failed.   If  the  stack  set  operation  fails  in  enough
                   accounts  within  a  Region,  the failure tolerance for the
                   stack set operation as a whole might be exceeded.

                 o RUNNING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   is currently in progress.

                 o PENDING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   has yet to start.

                 o SUCCEEDED : The operation  in  the  specified  account  and
                   Region completed successfully.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the assigned result status.

              AccountGateResult -> (structure)
                 The  results  of  the  account  gate  function CloudFormation
                 invokes, if present, before proceeding with stack set  opera-
                 tions in an account

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the account gate function.

                     o SUCCEEDED  :  The  account gate function has determined
                       that the account and Region passes any requirements for
                       a stack set operation to occur. CloudFormation proceeds
                       with the stack operation in that account and Region.

                     o FAILED : The account gate function has determined  that
                       the  account  and Region does not meet the requirements
                       for a stack set operation to occur. AWS  CloudFormation
                       cancels  the  stack  set  operation in that account and
                       Region, and sets the stack set operation result  status
                       for that account and Region to FAILED .

                     o SKIPPED   :  CloudFormation  has  skipped  calling  the
                       account gate function for this account and Region,  for
                       one of the following reasons:

                       o An  account  gate function has not been specified for
                         the account and Region. CloudFormation proceeds  with
                         the stack set operation in this account and Region.

                       o The   AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole  of  the
                         stack set adminstration account lacks permissions  to
                         invoke the function. CloudFormation proceeds with the
                         stack set operation in this account and Region.

                       o Either no action is necessary, or no action is possi-
                         ble, on the stack. CloudFormation skips the stack set
                         operation in this account and Region.

                 StatusReason -> (string)
                     The reason for the account gate status assigned  to  this
                     account and Region for the stack set operation.

              OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                 [Service-managed  permissions]  The  organization  root ID or
                 organizational  unit  (OU)  IDs  that   you   specified   for
                 DeploymentTargets .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  request  doesn't  return all results, NextToken is set to a
          token. To retrieve the next set of  results,  call  ListOperationRe-
          sults  again and assign that token to the request object's NextToken
          parameter. If there are no remaining results, NextToken  is  set  to
          null .
