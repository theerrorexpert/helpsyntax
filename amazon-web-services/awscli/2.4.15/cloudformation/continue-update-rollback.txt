CONTINUE-UPDATE-ROLLBACK()                          CONTINUE-UPDATE-ROLLBACK()



NAME
       continue-update-rollback -

DESCRIPTION
       For a specified stack that is in the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state, con-
       tinues rolling it back to the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state. Depending
       on  the  cause  of the failure, you can manually fix the error and con-
       tinue the rollback. By continuing the rollback,  you  can  return  your
       stack to a working state (the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state), and then
       try to update the stack again.

       A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when  CloudFormation
       cannot  roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example,
       you might have a stack that is rolling back to an old database instance
       that  was  deleted  outside  of  CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation
       doesn't know the database was deleted, it  assumes  that  the  database
       instance  still  exists  and  attempts  to roll back to it, causing the
       update rollback to fail.

SYNOPSIS
            continue-update-rollback
          --stack-name <value>
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--resources-to-skip <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the unique ID of the stack that  you  want  to  continue
          rolling back.

          NOTE:
              Don't  specify the name of a nested stack (a stack that was cre-
              ated by using the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource). Instead,
              use  this operation on the parent stack (the stack that contains
              the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource).

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access  Management
          (IAM)  role  that  CloudFormation  assumes  to  roll back the stack.
          CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to  make  calls  on  your
          behalf.  CloudFormation  always uses this role for all future opera-
          tions on the stack. As long as users have permission to  operate  on
          the  stack,  CloudFormation  uses  this role even if the users don't
          have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privi-
          lege.

          If  you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
          previously associated with the  stack.  If  no  role  is  available,
          CloudFormation  uses a temporary session that is generated from your
          user credentials.

       --resources-to-skip (list)
          A list of the logical IDs of the resources that CloudFormation skips
          during  the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only
          resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED  state  because  a  rollback
          failed.  You  can't  specify resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED
          state for other reasons, for example, because  an  update  was  can-
          celled.   To   check   why   a   resource  update  failed,  use  the
          DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status  reason.

          WARNING:
              Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that Cloud-
              Formation can't successfully roll back. We  recommend  that  you
              troubleshoot resources before skipping them. CloudFormation sets
              the status of the specified  resources  to  UPDATE_COMPLETE  and
              continues  to  roll  back  the stack. After the rollback is com-
              plete, the state of the skipped resources will  be  inconsistent
              with  the  state  of the resources in the stack template. Before
              performing another stack update, you must update  the  stack  or
              resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subse-
              quent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become  unre-
              coverable.

          Specify  the  minimum  number  of resources required to successfully
          roll back your stack. For example, a failed  resource  update  might
          cause  dependent  resources  to  fail. In this case, it might not be
          necessary to skip the dependent resources.

          To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the  following
          format:  NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID  . If you want to specify
          the logical ID of a stack resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
          ) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then its corresponding embedded stack
          must be  in  one  of  the  following  states:  DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  ,
          DELETE_COMPLETE , or DELETE_FAILED .

          NOTE:
              Don't  confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logi-
              cal ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue
              update   rollback   operation  with  nested  stacks,  see  Using
              ResourcesToSkip to recover a nested stacks hierarchy .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this ContinueUpdateRollback request. Specify
          this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormationknows
          that you're not attempting to continue the rollback to a stack  with
          the  same  name.  You might retry ContinueUpdateRollback requests to
          ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retry an update rollback

       The following continue-update-rollback example resumes a rollback oper-
       ation from a previously failed stack update.

          aws cloudformation continue-update-rollback \
              --stack-name my-stack

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
