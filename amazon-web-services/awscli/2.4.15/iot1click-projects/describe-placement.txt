DESCRIBE-PLACEMENT()                                      DESCRIBE-PLACEMENT()



NAME
       describe-placement -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a placement in a project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-placement
          --placement-name <value>
          --project-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --placement-name (string)
          The name of the placement within a project.

       --project-name (string)
          The project containing the placement to be described.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a placement for a project

       The  following describe-placement example describes a placement for the
       specified project.

              --project-name AnytownDumpsters \
              --placement-name customer217

       Output:

          {
              "placement": {
                  "projectName": "AnytownDumpsters",
                  "placementName": "customer217",
                  "attributes": {

                  },
                  "createdDate": 1563488454,
                  "updatedDate": 1563488454
