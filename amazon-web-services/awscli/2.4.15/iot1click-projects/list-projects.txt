LIST-PROJECTS()                                                LIST-PROJECTS()



NAME
       list-projects -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  AWS IoT 1-Click project(s) associated with your AWS account
       and region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-projects is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: projects

SYNOPSIS
            list-projects
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all AWS IoT 1-Click projects

       The following list-projects example list all AWS IoT  1-Click  projects
       in your account.

          aws iot1click-projects list-projects

       Output:

          {
              "projects": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:iot1click:us-west-2:012345678901:projects/AnytownDumpsters",
                      "projectName": "AnytownDumpsters",
                      "createdDate": 1563483100,
                      "updatedDate": 1563483100,
                      "tags": {}
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       projects -> (list)
          An object containing the list of projects.

          (structure)
              An object providing summary information for a particular project
              for an associated AWS account and region.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the project.

              projectName -> (string)
                 The name of the project being summarized.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  when  the  project was originally created, in UNIX
                 epoch time format.

              updatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the project was last  updated,  in  UNIX  epoch
                 time format. If the project was not updated, then createdDate
                 and updatedDate are the same.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags  (metadata  key/value  pairs)  associated  with  the
                 project.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token used to retrieve the next set of results - will be effec-
          tively empty if there are no further results.
