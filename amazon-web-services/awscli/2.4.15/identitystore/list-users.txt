LIST-USERS()                                                      LIST-USERS()



NAME
       list-users -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  attribute  name and value of the user that you specified in
       the search. We only support UserName as a valid filter  attribute  path
       currently, and filter is required. This API returns minimum attributes,
       including UserId and UserName in the response.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-users
          --identity-store-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-store-id (string)
          The globally unique identifier  for  the  identity  store,  such  as
          d-1234567890 . In this example, d- is a fixed prefix, and 1234567890
          is a randomly generated string that contains number and  lower  case
          letters.  This  value  is  generated at the time that a new identity
          store is created.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results  to  be  returned  per  request.  This
          parameter is used in the ListUsers and ListGroups request to specify
          how many results to return in one page. The length limit is 50 char-
          acters.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token used for the ListUsers and ListGroups API oper-
          ations. This value is generated by the identity store service. It is
          returned  in the API response if the total results are more than the
          size of one page. This token is also returned when it is used in the
          API request to search for the next page.

       --filters (list)
          A  list  of Filter objects, which is used in the ListUsers and List-
          Groups request.

          (structure)
              A query filter used by ListUsers and  ListGroup  .  This  filter
              object provides the attribute name and attribute value to search
              users or groups.

              AttributePath -> (string)
                 The attribute path that is used to  specify  which  attribute
                 name  to search. Length limit is 255 characters. For example,
                 UserName is a valid attribute path for the ListUsers API, and
                 DisplayName is a valid attribute path for the ListGroups API.

              AttributeValue -> (string)
                 Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is
                 described as a name-value pair.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributePath=string,AttributeValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AttributePath": "string",
              "AttributeValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Users -> (list)
          A list of User objects in the identity store.

          (structure)
              A  user  object,  which  contains a specified users metadata and
              attributes.

              UserName -> (string)
                 Contains the users user name value. The length limit  is  128
                 characters. This value can consist of letters, accented char-
                 acters, symbols, numbers,  and  punctuation.  The  characters
                 <>;:%  are  excluded. This value is specified at the time the
                 user is created and stored as an attribute of the user object
                 in the identity store.

              UserId -> (string)
                 The identifier for a user in the identity store.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token used for the ListUsers and ListGroups API oper-
          ations. This value is generated by the identity store service. It is
          returned  in the API response if the total results are more than the
          size of one page. This token is also returned when it is used in the
          API request to search for the next page.
