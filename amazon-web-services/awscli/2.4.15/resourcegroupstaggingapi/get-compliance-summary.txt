GET-COMPLIANCE-SUMMARY()                              GET-COMPLIANCE-SUMMARY()



NAME
       get-compliance-summary -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  table  that shows counts of resources that are noncompliant
       with their tag policies.

       For more information on tag policies, see Tag Policies in the Organiza-
       tions User Guide.

       You  can  call  this  operation only from the organization's management
       account and from the us-east-1 Region.

       This operation supports pagination, where the response can be  sent  in
       multiple pages. You should check the PaginationToken response parameter
       to determine if there  are  additional  results  available  to  return.
       Repeat  the query, passing the PaginationToken response parameter value
       as an input to the next request until you recieve a null value. A  null
       value  for  PaginationToken  indicates  that  there are no more results
       waiting to be returned.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-compliance-summary is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: SummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            get-compliance-summary
          [--target-id-filters <value>]
          [--region-filters <value>]
          [--resource-type-filters <value>]
          [--tag-key-filters <value>]
          [--group-by <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-id-filters (list)
          Specifies  target  identifiers  (usually,  specific  account IDs) to
          limit the output by.  If  you  use  this  parameter,  the  count  of
          returned  noncompliant  resources  includes  only resources with the
          specified target IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --region-filters (list)
          Specifies a list of Amazon Web Services Regions to limit the  output
          to.  If  you  use this parameter, the count of returned noncompliant
          resources includes only resources in the specified Regions.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-type-filters (list)
          Specifies that you want the response to include information for only
          resources  of  the specified types. The format of each resource type
          is service[:resourceType] . For example, specifying a resource  type
          of  ec2  returns  all  Amazon  EC2  resources  (which  includes  EC2
          instances). Specifying a resource type of ec2:instance returns  only
          EC2 instances.

          The  string  for  each service name and resource type is the same as
          that embedded in a resource's Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN).  Consult
          the * Amazon Web Services General Reference * for the following:

          o For  a  list of service name strings, see Amazon Web Services Ser-
            vice Namespaces .

          o For resource type strings, see Example ARNs .

          o For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)
            and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

          You  can  specify multiple resource types by using a comma separated
          array. The array can include up to 100 items. Note that  the  length
          constraint requirement applies to each resource type filter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-key-filters (list)
          Specifies that you want the response to include information for only
          resources that have tags with the specified tag  keys.  If  you  use
          this   parameter,  the  count  of  returned  noncompliant  resources
          includes only resources that have the specified tag keys.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --group-by (list)
          Specifies a list of attributes to group the counts  of  noncompliant
          resources   by.   If  supplied,  the  counts  are  sorted  by  those
          attributes.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TARGET_ID
            REGION
            RESOURCE_TYPE

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          the next page.
