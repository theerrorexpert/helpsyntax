GET-TAG-KEYS()                                                  GET-TAG-KEYS()



NAME
       get-tag-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all tag keys currently in use in the specified Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region for the calling account.

       This operation supports pagination, where the response can be  sent  in
       multiple pages. You should check the PaginationToken response parameter
       to determine if there  are  additional  results  available  to  return.
       Repeat  the query, passing the PaginationToken response parameter value
       as an input to the next request until you recieve a null value. A  null
       value  for  PaginationToken  indicates  that  there are no more results
       waiting to be returned.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-tag-keys is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: TagKeys

SYNOPSIS
            get-tag-keys
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of all tag keys

       The  following  get-tag-keys  example retrieves the list of all tag key
       names used by resources in the account.

          aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-tag-keys

       Output:

          {
              "TagKeys": [
                  "Environment",
                  "CostCenter",
                  "Department"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see GetTagKeys in the Resource Groups Tagging API
       Reference.

OUTPUT
       PaginationToken -> (string)
          A  string that indicates that there is more data available than this
          response contains. To receive the next part of the response, specify
          this  response value as the PaginationToken value in the request for
          the next page.

       TagKeys -> (list)
          A list of all tag keys in the Amazon Web Services account.

          (string)



                                                                GET-TAG-KEYS()
