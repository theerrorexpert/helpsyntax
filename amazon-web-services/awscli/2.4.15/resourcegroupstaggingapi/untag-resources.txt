UNTAG-RESOURCES()                                            UNTAG-RESOURCES()



NAME
       untag-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified tags from the specified resources. When you spec-
       ify a tag key, the action removes both  that  key  and  its  associated
       value. The operation succeeds even if you attempt to remove tags from a
       resource that were already removed. Note the following:

       o To remove tags from a resource, you need  the  necessary  permissions
         for  the  service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions
         for removing tags. For more information, see  the  documentation  for
         the service whose resource you want to untag.

       o You  can  only tag resources that are located in the specified Amazon
         Web Services Region for the calling Amazon Web Services account.
          Minimum permissions

       In addition to the tag:UntagResources permission required by this oper-
       ation,  you  must  also  have the remove tags permission defined by the
       service that created the resource. For example, to remove the tags from
       an  Amazon  EC2  instance  using the UntagResources operation, you must
       have both of the following permissions:

       o tag:UntagResource

       o ec2:DeleteTags

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            untag-resources
          --resource-arn-list <value>
          --tag-keys <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn-list (list)
          Specifies a list of ARNs of the resources that you  want  to  remove
          tags from.

          An  ARN  (Amazon  Resource Name) uniquely identifies a resource. For
          more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  and  Amazon  Web
          Services  Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services General Ref-
          erence .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-keys (list)
          Specifies a list of tag keys that you want to remove from the speci-
          fied resources.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To remove a tag from a resource

       The  following  untag-resources  example removes the specified tag keys
       and any associated values from the specified resource.

          aws resourcegroupstaggingapi untag-resources \
              --resource-arn-list arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket \
              --tag-keys Environment CostCenter

       Output:

          {
              "FailedResourcesMap": {}
          }

       For more information, see UntagResources in the Resource Groups Tagging
       API Reference.

OUTPUT
       FailedResourcesMap -> (map)
          A map containing a key-value pair for each failed item that couldn't
          be untagged. The key is the ARN of the failed resource. The value is
          a FailureInfo object that contains an error code, a status code, and
          an error message. If there are no errors, the FailedResourcesMap  is
          empty.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Information  about  the errors that are returned for each failed
              resource. This information can include  InternalServiceException
              and  InvalidParameterException  errors.  It can also include any
              valid error code returned by the  Amazon  Web  Services  service
              that hosts the resource that the ARN key represents.

              The following are common error codes that you might receive from
              other Amazon Web Services services:

              o InternalServiceException  This  can  mean  that  the  Resource
                Groups Tagging API didn't receive a response from another Ama-
                zon Web Services service. It can also mean that  the  resource
                type  in  the  request is not supported by the Resource Groups
                Tagging API. In these cases, it's safe to  retry  the  request
                and then call GetResources to verify the changes.

              o AccessDeniedException   This can mean that you need permission
                to call the tagging operations in the Amazon Web Services ser-
                vice  that  contains  the  resource.  For  example, to use the
                Resource Groups Tagging API to tag a Amazon  CloudWatch  alarm
                resource,  you  need  permission  to  call both ` TagResources
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_TagResources.html`__
                and                        `                       TagResource
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html`__
                in the CloudWatch API.

              For  more  information  on  errors that are generated from other
              Amazon Web Services services, see  the  documentation  for  that
              service.

              StatusCode -> (integer)
                 The HTTP status code of the common error.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  code  of  the  common error. Valid values include Inter-
                 nalServiceException ,  InvalidParameterException  ,  and  any
                 valid  error code returned by the Amazon Web Services service
                 that hosts the resource that you want to tag.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The message of the common error.
