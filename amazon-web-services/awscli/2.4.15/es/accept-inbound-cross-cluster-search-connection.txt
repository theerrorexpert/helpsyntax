ACCEPT-INBOUND-CROSS-CLUSTER-SACCEPT-INBOUND-CROSS-CLUSTER-SEARCH-CONNECTION()



NAME
       accept-inbound-cross-cluster-search-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  the destination domain owner to accept an inbound cross-cluster
       search connection request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            accept-inbound-cross-cluster-search-connection
          --cross-cluster-search-connection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cross-cluster-search-connection-id (string)
          The id of the inbound connection that you want to accept.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 (hyphen).

              Region -> (string)

          CrossClusterSearchConnectionId -> (string)
              Specifies the connection id for the inbound cross-cluster search
              connection.

          ConnectionStatus -> (structure)
              Specifies the `` InboundCrossClusterSearchConnectionStatus`` for
              the outbound connection.

              StatusCode -> (string)
