SYNOPSIS
            list-speaker-enrollment-jobs
          --domain-id <value>
          [--job-status <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the speaker enrollment jobs.

       --job-status (string)
          Provides the status of your speaker enrollment Job.

          Possible values:

          o SUBMITTED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS

          o FAILED

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results that are returned per  call.  You  can
          use  NextToken  to  obtain  further pages of results. The default is
          100; the maximum allowed page size is also 100.

       --next-token (string)
          If NextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of NextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep  all  other  arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires
          after 24 hours.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobSummaries -> (list)
          A list containing details about each  specified  speaker  enrollment
          job.

          (structure)
              Contains  a  summary  of  information about a speaker enrollment
              job.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp showing the creation time of the speaker  enroll-
                 ment job.

              DomainId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the  domain  that  contains  the speaker

                 Contains details that are populated when an entire batch  job
                 fails.  In cases of individual registration job failures, the
                 batch job as a whole doesn't fail; it  is  completed  with  a
                 JobStatus of COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS . You can use the job out-
                 put file to identify  the  individual  registration  requests
                 that failed.

                 Message -> (string)

                     An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

              JobId -> (string)

                 job.

                 The client-provided name for the speaker enrollment job.

              JobProgress -> (structure)
                 Provides details regarding job progress. This field shows the
                 completed  percentage  of  enrollment  requests listed in the
                 input file.

                 PercentComplete -> (integer)
                     Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or registra-
                     tion requests listed in the input file.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the speaker enrollment job.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  NextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
