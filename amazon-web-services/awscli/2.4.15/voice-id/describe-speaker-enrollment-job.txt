NAME
       describe-speaker-enrollment-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified speaker enrollment job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-speaker-enrollment-job
          --domain-id <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The  identifier of the domain containing the speaker enrollment job.

       --job-id (string)
          The identifier of the speaker enrollment job you are describing.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Job -> (structure)
          Contains details about the specified speaker enrollment job.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp showing the creation of the speaker enrollment  job.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  IAM  role  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID
              permissions to access customer's buckets to read the input mani-
              fest file and write the job output file.

          DomainId -> (string)
              The  identifier  of the domain that contains the speaker enroll-
              ment job.

          EndedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp showing when the speaker enrollment job ended.

          EnrollmentConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration that defines  the  action  to  take  when  the
              speaker is already enrolled in Voice ID, and the FraudDetection-
              Config to use.

              ExistingEnrollmentAction -> (string)
                 The action to take when  the  specified  speaker  is  already
                 enrolled in the specified domain. The default value is SKIP ,
                 which skips the enrollment for the existing speaker.  Setting
                 the value to OVERWRITE replaces the existing voice prints and
                 enrollment audio stored for that speaker with new data gener-
                 ated from the latest audio.

              FraudDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                 The  fraud  detection  configuration  to  use for the speaker
                 enrollment job.

                 FraudDetectionAction -> (string)
                     The action to take when the given speaker is  flagged  by
                     the  fraud  detection system. The default value is FAIL ,
                     which fails the speaker enrollment. Changing  this  value
                     to  IGNORE  results in the speaker being enrolled even if
                     they are flagged by the fraud detection system.

                 RiskThreshold -> (integer)
                     Threshold value for determining whether the speaker is  a
                     high  risk  to  be fraudulent. If the detected risk score
                     calculated by Voice ID is greater than or  equal  to  the
                     threshold, the speaker is considered a fraudster.

          FailureDetails -> (structure)
              Contains  details  that  are  populated when an entire batch job
              fails. In cases of individual  registration  job  failures,  the
              batch  job  as a whole doesn't fail; it is completed with a Job-
              Status of COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS . You can  use  the  job  output
              file  to  identify  the  individual  registration  requests that
              failed.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the error that caused the batch job failure.

              StatusCode -> (integer)
                 An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The  input  data config containing an S3 URI for the input mani-
              fest file that contains  the  list  of  speaker  enrollment  job
              requests.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The S3 location for the input manifest file that contains the
                 list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

          JobId -> (string)
              The service-generated identifier for the speaker enrollment job.

          JobName -> (string)
              The client-provided name for the speaker enrollment job.

          JobProgress -> (structure)
              Provides details on job progress. This field shows the completed
              percentage of registration requests listed in the input file.

              PercentComplete -> (integer)
                 Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or  registration
                 requests listed in the input file.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the speaker enrollment job.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data config containing the S3 location where Voice ID
              writes the job output file; you must also include a KMS  Key  ID
              to encrypt the file.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 the  identifier  of  the  KMS key you want Voice ID to use to
                 encrypt the output file of the fraudster registration job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The S3 path of the folder to which Voice ID  writes  the  job
                 output file, which has a *.out extension. For example, if the
                 input file name is input-file.json and the output folder path
                 is  s3://output-bucket/output-folder  ,  the full output file
                 path                is                s3://output-bucket/out-
                 put-folder/job-Id/input-file.json.out .
