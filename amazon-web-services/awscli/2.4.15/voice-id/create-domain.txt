SYNOPSIS
            create-domain
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          --server-side-encryption-configuration <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token for creating a new domain.  If  not  provided,
          Amazon Web Services SDK populates this field.

       --description (string)
          A brief description of this domain.

       --name (string)
          The name of the domain.

       --server-side-encryption-configuration (structure)
          The  configuration, containing the KMS Key Identifier, to be used by
          Voice ID for the server-side  encryption  of  your  data.  Refer  to
          Amazon  Connect  VoiceID  encryption at rest for more details on how
          the KMS Key is used.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The identifier of the KMS Key  you  want  Voice  ID  to  use  to
              encrypt your data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyId": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags you want added to the domain.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be assigned to a Voice ID resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  first  part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
