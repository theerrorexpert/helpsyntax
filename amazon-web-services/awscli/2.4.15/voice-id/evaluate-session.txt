EVALUATE-SESSION()                                          EVALUATE-SESSION()



NAME
       evaluate-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Evaluates  a specified session based on audio data accumulated during a
       streaming Amazon Connect Voice ID call.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            evaluate-session
          --domain-id <value>
          --session-name-or-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain where the session started.

       --session-name-or-id (string)
          The session identifier, or name of the session,  that  you  want  to
          evaluate. In Voice ID integration, this is the Contact-Id.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AuthenticationResult -> (structure)
          Details resulting from the authentication process, such as authenti-
          cation decision and authentication score.

          AudioAggregationEndedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp indicating when audio  aggregation  ended  for  this
              authentication result.

          AudioAggregationStartedAt -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp  indicating when audio aggregation started for this
              authentication result.

          AuthenticationResultId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for this  authentication  result.  Because
              there  can be multiple authentications for a given session, this
              field helps to identify if the returned result is from a  previ-
              ous  streaming activity or a new result. Note that in absence of
              any new  streaming  activity,  AcceptanceThreshold  changes,  or
              SpeakerId changes, Voice ID always returns cached Authentication
              Result for this API.

          Configuration -> (structure)
              The AuthenticationConfiguration used to generate this  authenti-
              cation result.

              AcceptanceThreshold -> (integer)
                 The  minimum  threshold needed to successfully authenticate a
                 speaker.

          CustomerSpeakerId -> (string)
              The client-provided identifier for the speaker whose authentica-
              tion result is produced. Only present if a SpeakerId is provided
              for the session.

          Decision -> (string)
              The authentication decision  produced  by  Voice  ID,  processed
              against  the  current  session  state  and streamed audio of the
              speaker.

          GeneratedSpeakerId -> (string)
              The service-generated identifier for the speaker whose authenti-
              cation result is produced.

          Score -> (integer)
              The  authentication  score  for the speaker whose authentication
              result is produced. This value is only present if the  authenti-
              cation decision is either ACCEPT or REJECT .

       DomainId -> (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the session.

       FraudDetectionResult -> (structure)
          Details  resulting  from  the fraud detection process, such as fraud
          detection decision and risk score.

          AudioAggregationEndedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp indicating when audio  aggregation  ended  for  this
              fraud detection result.

          AudioAggregationStartedAt -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp  indicating when audio aggregation started for this
              fraud detection result.

          Configuration -> (structure)
              The FraudDetectionConfiguration  used  to  generate  this  fraud
              detection result.

              RiskThreshold -> (integer)
                 Threshold  value  for  determining  whether  the speaker is a
                 fraudster. If the detected risk score calculated by Voice  ID
                 is  higher  than  the  threshold, the speaker is considered a
                 fraudster.

          Decision -> (string)
              The fraud detection decision produced  by  Voice  ID,  processed
              against  the  current  session  state  and streamed audio of the
              speaker.

          FraudDetectionResultId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for this  fraud  detection  result.  Given
              there can be multiple fraud detections for a given session, this
              field helps in identifying if the returned result is from previ-
              ous streaming activity or a new result. Note that in the absence
              of any new streaming activity or risk threshold  changes,  Voice
              ID always returns cached Fraud Detection result for this API.

          Reasons -> (list)
              The  reason  speaker  was flagged by the fraud detection system.
              This is  only  be  populated  if  fraud  detection  Decision  is
              HIGH_RISK , and only has one possible value: KNOWN_FRAUDSTER .

              (string)

          RiskDetails -> (structure)
              Details about each risk analyzed for this speaker.

              KnownFraudsterRisk -> (structure)
                 The details resulting from 'Known Fraudster Risk' analysis of
                 the speaker.

                 GeneratedFraudsterId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the fraudster that is the closest match
                     to  the speaker. If there are no fraudsters registered in
                     a given domain, or if there  are  no  fraudsters  with  a
                     non-zero RiskScore, this value is null .

                 RiskScore -> (integer)
                     The  score  indicating  the  likelihood  the speaker is a
                     known fraudster.

       SessionId -> (string)
          The service-generated identifier of the session.

       SessionName -> (string)
          The client-provided name of the session.

       StreamingStatus -> (string)
          The current status of audio streaming for this session.  This  field
          is  useful  to  infer  next  steps  when the Authentication or Fraud
          Detection results are empty or the decision is  NOT_ENOUGH_SPEECH  .
          In this situation, if the StreamingStatus is ONGOING/PENDING_CONFIG-
          URATION , it can mean that the client  should  call  the  API  again
          later,  once  Voice  ID has enough audio to produce a result. If the
          decision remains NOT_ENOUGH_SPEECH  even  after  StreamingStatus  is
          ENDED  ,  it means that the previously streamed session did not have
          enough speech to perform evaluation, and a new streaming session  is
          needed to try again.
