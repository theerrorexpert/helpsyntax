OPT-OUT-SPEAKER()                                            OPT-OUT-SPEAKER()



NAME
       opt-out-speaker -

DESCRIPTION
       Opts  out  a  speaker  from Voice ID system. A speaker can be opted out
       regardless of whether or not they already exist in the system. If  they
       don't  yet  exist,  a  new speaker is created in an opted out state. If
       they already exist, their existing status is overridden  and  they  are
       opted  out.  Enrollment  and  evaluation  authentication  requests  are
       rejected for opted out speakers, and opted out speakers have  no  voice
       embeddings stored in the system.

SYNOPSIS
            opt-out-speaker
          --domain-id <value>
          --speaker-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the speaker.

       --speaker-id (string)
          The identifier of the speaker you want opted-out.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
