SYNOPSIS
            start-speaker-enrollment-job
          [--client-token <value>]
          --data-access-role-arn <value>
          --domain-id <value>
          [--enrollment-config <value>]
          --input-data-config <value>
          [--job-name <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The  idempotency token for starting a new speaker enrollment Job. If
          not provided, Amazon Web Services SDK populates this field.

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID permis-
          sions  to  access customer's buckets to read the input manifest file
          and write the job output file. Refer to Batch enrollment using audio
          data  from  prior  calls documentation for the permissions needed in
          this role.

       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain that contains  the  speaker  enrollment
          job and in which the speakers are enrolled.

       --enrollment-config (structure)
          The  enrollment  config  that contains details such as the action to
          take when a speaker is already enrolled in the Voice  ID  system  or
          when a speaker is identified as a fraudster.

          ExistingEnrollmentAction -> (string)
              The  action  to  take  when  the  specified  speaker  is already
              enrolled in the specified domain. The default value  is  SKIP  ,
              which skips the enrollment for the existing speaker. Setting the
              value to  OVERWRITE  replaces  the  existing  voice  prints  and
              enrollment audio stored for that speaker with new data generated
              from the latest audio.

          FraudDetectionConfig -> (structure)
              The fraud detection configuration to use for the speaker enroll-
              ment job.

              FraudDetectionAction -> (string)
                 The  action  to take when the given speaker is flagged by the
                 fraud detection system. The default value  is  FAIL  ,  which
                 fails  the  speaker enrollment. Changing this value to IGNORE
                 results in the  speaker  being  enrolled  even  if  they  are
                 flagged by the fraud detection system.

              RiskThreshold -> (integer)
                 Threshold value for determining whether the speaker is a high
                 risk to be fraudulent. If the detected risk score  calculated
                 by  Voice  ID  is greater than or equal to the threshold, the
                 speaker is considered a fraudster.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ExistingEnrollmentAction=string,FraudDetectionConfig={FraudDetectionAction=string,RiskThreshold=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ExistingEnrollmentAction": "SKIP"|"OVERWRITE",
            "FraudDetectionConfig": {
              "FraudDetectionAction": "IGNORE"|"FAIL",

          fest file that contains the list of speaker enrollment requests.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The  S3  location  for the input manifest file that contains the
              list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string"
          }

       --job-name (string)
          A name for your speaker enrollment job.

       --output-data-config (structure)
          The output data config containing the S3  location  where  Voice  ID
          writes  the  job  output file; you must also include a KMS Key ID to
          encrypt the file.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              the identifier of the KMS key  you  want  Voice  ID  to  use  to
              encrypt the output file of the fraudster registration job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The  S3 path of the folder to which Voice ID writes the job out-
              put file, which has a *.out extension. For example, if the input
              file  name  is  input-file.json  and  the  output folder path is
              s3://output-bucket/output-folder , the full output file path  is
              s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/input-file.json.out .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyId=string,S3Uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyId": "string",
            "S3Uri": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              permissions to access customer's buckets to read the input mani-
              fest file and write the job output file.

          DomainId -> (string)
              The identifier of the domain that contains the  speaker  enroll-
              ment job.

          EndedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp showing when the speaker enrollment job ended.

          EnrollmentConfig -> (structure)
              The  configuration  that  defines  the  action  to take when the
              speaker is already enrolled in Voice ID, and the FraudDetection-
              Config to use.

              ExistingEnrollmentAction -> (string)
                 The  action  to  take  when  the specified speaker is already
                 enrolled in the specified domain. The default value is SKIP ,
                 which  skips the enrollment for the existing speaker. Setting
                 the value to OVERWRITE replaces the existing voice prints and
                 enrollment audio stored for that speaker with new data gener-
                 ated from the latest audio.

              FraudDetectionConfig -> (structure)

                     The  action  to take when the given speaker is flagged by
                     the fraud detection system. The default value is  FAIL  ,
                     which  fails  the speaker enrollment. Changing this value
                     to IGNORE results in the speaker being enrolled  even  if
                     they are flagged by the fraud detection system.

              fails.  In  cases  of  individual registration job failures, the

                 output file, which has a *.out extension. For example, if the
                 input file name is input-file.json and the output folder path
                 is s3://output-bucket/output-folder , the  full  output  file
