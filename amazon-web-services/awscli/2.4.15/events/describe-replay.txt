DESCRIBE-REPLAY()                                            DESCRIBE-REPLAY()



NAME
       describe-replay -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  details  about a replay. Use DescribeReplay to determine the
       progress of a running replay. A replay processes events to replay based
       on the time in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If
       you use StartReplay and specify an EventStartTime and  an  EventEndTime
       that  covers  a  20 minute time range, the events are replayed from the
       first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the  events  from  the
       second minute are replayed. You can use DescribeReplay to determine the
       progress of a replay.  The  value  returned  for  EventLastReplayedTime
       indicates  the time within the specified time range associated with the
       last event replayed.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replay
          --replay-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replay-name (string)
          The name of the replay to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              events only to the event bus specified to create the archive.

          FilterArns -> (list)
              A list of ARNs for rules to replay events to.

              (string)

       EventEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The time stamp for the last event that was  replayed  from  the  ar-
          chive.
