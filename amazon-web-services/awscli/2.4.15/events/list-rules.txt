LIST-RULES()                                                      LIST-RULES()



NAME
       list-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  your Amazon EventBridge rules. You can either list all the rules
       or you can provide a prefix to match to the rule names.

       ListRules does not list the targets of a rule. To see the targets asso-
       ciated with a rule, use ListTargetsByRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-rules  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Rules

SYNOPSIS
            list-rules
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--event-bus-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          The prefix matching the rule name.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus to list the rules for. If you  omit
          this, the default event bus is used.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To display a list of all CloudWatch Events rules

       This example displays all CloudWatch Events rules in the region:

          aws events list-rules

       To display a list of CloudWatch Events rules beginning with  a  certain
       string.

       This  example  displays  all CloudWatch Events rules in the region that
       have a name starting with "Daily":

          aws events list-rules --name-prefix "Daily"

OUTPUT
       Rules -> (list)
          The rules that match the specified criteria.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a rule in Amazon EventBridge.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.

              EventPattern -> (string)
                 The event pattern of the  rule.  For  more  information,  see
                 Events  and  Event  Patterns  in  the Amazon EventBridge User
                 Guide .

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the rule.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the rule.

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 The scheduling expression. For example, "cron(0 20 * * ?
                 *
                 )", "rate(5 minutes)". For more information, see Creating  an
                 Amazon EventBridge rule that runs on a schedule .

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the role that is used for
                 target invocation.

                 If you're setting an event bus in another account as the tar-
                 get  and  that  account  granted  permission  to your account
                 through an organization instead of directly  by  the  account
                 ID, you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the
                 Target structure, instead of here in this parameter.

              ManagedBy -> (string)
                 If the rule was created on behalf of your account by an  Ama-
                 zon  Web  Services service, this field displays the principal
                 name of the service that created the rule.

              EventBusName -> (string)
                 The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If
                 you omit this, the default event bus is used.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Indicates whether there are additional results to retrieve. If there
          are no more results, the value is null.
