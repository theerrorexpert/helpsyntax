       event bus. Amazon Web Services customers do not use this operation.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-partner-events
          --entries <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          The list of events to write to the event bus.

          (structure)
              The details about an event generated by an SaaS partner.

              Time -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the event.

              Source -> (string)
                 The event source that is generating the entry.

              Resources -> (list)
                 Amazon Web Services resources, identified by Amazon  Resource
                 Name  (ARN),  which the event primarily concerns. Any number,
                 including zero, may be present.

                 (string)

              DetailType -> (string)
                 A free-form string used to decide what fields  to  expect  in
                 the event detail.

              Detail -> (string)
                 A  valid  JSON  string. There is no other schema imposed. The
                 JSON string may contain fields and nested subobjects.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Time=timestamp,Source=string,Resources=string,string,DetailType=string,Detail=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Time": timestamp,
              "Source": "string",
              "Resources": ["string", ...],
              "DetailType": "string",
              "Detail": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedEntryCount -> (integer)
          The number of events from this operation that could not  be  written
          to the partner event bus.

       Entries -> (list)
          The  list of events from this operation that were successfully writ-
          ten to the partner event bus.

          (structure)
              Represents an event  that  a  partner  tried  to  generate,  but
              failed.

              EventId -> (string)
                 The ID of the event.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  error  code  that  indicates  why  the  event submission
                 failed.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message that  explains  why  the  event  submission
