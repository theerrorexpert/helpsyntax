NAME
       list-archives -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  your  archives.  You can either list all the archives or you can
       provide a prefix to match to the archive names. Filter  parameters  are
       exclusive.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-archives
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--event-source-arn <value>]
          [--state <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A  name  prefix  to filter the archives returned. Only archives with
          name that match the prefix are returned.

       --event-source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the event source associated with the archive.

       --state (string)
          The state of the archive.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

          o CREATING

          o UPDATING

          o CREATE_FAILED

          o UPDATE_FAILED

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned by a previous call to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the archive.

              StateReason -> (string)

              RetentionDays -> (integer)

              EventCount -> (long)
                 The number of events in the archive.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
