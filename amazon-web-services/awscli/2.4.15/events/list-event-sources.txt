DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use  this to see all the partner event sources that have been

       about partner event sources, see CreateEventBus .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-event-sources
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          Specifying  this  limits  the  results  to  only those partner event
          sources with names that start with the specified prefix.

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned by a previous call to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --limit (integer)
          Specifying this limits the number of results returned by this opera-
          tion. The operation also returns a NextToken which you can use in  a
          subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventSources -> (list)
          The list of event sources.

          (structure)
              A  partner event source is created by an SaaS partner. If a cus-
              tomer creates a  partner  event  bus  that  matches  this  event
              source, that Amazon Web Services account can receive events from
              the partner's applications or services.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the event source.

              CreatedBy -> (string)
                 The name of the partner that created the event source.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the event source was created.

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the event source will expire,  if  the
                 Amazon  Web  Services account doesn't create a matching event
                 bus for it.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the event source.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the event source. If  it  is  ACTIVE,  you  have
                 already  created  a matching event bus for this event source,
                 and that event bus is active. If it is  PENDING,  either  you
                 haven't  yet  created a matching event bus, or that event bus
                 is deactivated. If it is DELETED, you have created a matching
                 event bus, but the event source has since been deleted.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next
          set of results.
