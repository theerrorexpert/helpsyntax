DESCRIPTION

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-connections
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--connection-state <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A  name  prefix  to filter results returned. Only connections with a
          name that starts with the prefix are returned.

       --connection-state (string)
          The state of the connection.

          Possible values:

          o CREATING

          o UPDATING

          o DELETING

          o AUTHORIZED

          o DEAUTHORIZED

          o AUTHORIZING

          o DEAUTHORIZING

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned by a previous call to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of connections to return.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
