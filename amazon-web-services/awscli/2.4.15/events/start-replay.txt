START-REPLAY()                                                  START-REPLAY()



NAME
       start-replay -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the specified replay. Events are not necessarily replayed in the
       exact same order that they were added to the  archive.  A  replay  pro-
       cesses  events  to  replay  based on the time in the event, and replays
       them using 1 minute intervals. If you specify an EventStartTime and  an
       EventEndTime  that  covers  a  20  minute  time  range,  the events are
       replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then  the
       events  from the second minute are replayed. You can use DescribeReplay
       to determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for EventLas-
       tReplayedTime  indicates the time within the specified time range asso-
       ciated with the last event replayed.

SYNOPSIS
            start-replay
          --replay-name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --event-source-arn <value>
          --event-start-time <value>
          --event-end-time <value>
          --destination <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replay-name (string)
          The name of the replay to start.

       --description (string)
          A description for the replay to start.

       --event-source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the archive to replay events from.

       --event-start-time (timestamp)
          A time stamp for the time to start  replaying  events.  Only  events
          that  occurred  between  the  EventStartTime  and  EventEndTime  are
          replayed.

       --event-end-time (timestamp)
          A time stamp for the time to stop replaying events. Only events that
          occurred between the EventStartTime and EventEndTime are replayed.

       --destination (structure)
          A  ReplayDestination object that includes details about the destina-
          tion for the replay.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the event bus to replay  event  to.  You  can  replay
              events only to the event bus specified to create the archive.

          FilterArns -> (list)
              A list of ARNs for rules to replay events to.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Arn=string,FilterArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Arn": "string",
            "FilterArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ReplayArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the replay.

       State -> (string)
          The state of the replay.

       StateReason -> (string)
          The reason that the replay is in the state.

       ReplayStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the replay started.
