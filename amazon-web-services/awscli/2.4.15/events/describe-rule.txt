NAME
       describe-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified rule.

       DescribeRule  does  not  list the targets of a rule. To see the targets
       associated with a rule, use ListTargetsByRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-rule
          --name <value>
          [--event-bus-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the  rule.  If  you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To display information about a CloudWatch Events rule

       This example displays information about the rule named DailyLambdaFunc-
       tion:

          aws events describe-rule --name "DailyLambdaFunction"

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the rule.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.

       EventPattern -> (string)
          The event pattern. For more information, see Events and  Event  Pat-
          terns in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide .

       ScheduleExpression -> (string)
          The scheduling expression. For example, "cron(0 20 * * ?
          *
          )", "rate(5 minutes)".

       State -> (string)
          Specifies whether the rule is enabled or disabled.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the rule.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associated with the
          rule.

       ManagedBy -> (string)
          If this is a managed rule, created by an Amazon Web Services service
          on your behalf, this field displays the principal name of the Amazon
          Web Services service that created the rule.

       EventBusName -> (string)
          The name of the event bus associated with the rule.

       CreatedBy -> (string)
          The account ID of the user that created the rule. If you use PutRule
          to  put a rule on an event bus in another account, the other account
          is the owner of the rule, and the rule ARN includes the  account  ID
          for that account. However, the value for CreatedBy is the account ID
          as the account that created the rule in the other account.
