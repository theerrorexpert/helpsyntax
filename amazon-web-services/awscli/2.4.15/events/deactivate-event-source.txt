DEACTIVATE-EVENT-SOURCE()                            DEACTIVATE-EVENT-SOURCE()



NAME
       deactivate-event-source -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use  this operation to temporarily stop receiving events from
       the specified partner event source.  The  matching  event  bus  is  not
       deleted.

       When  you deactivate a partner event source, the source goes into PEND-
       ING state. If it remains in PENDING state for more than two  weeks,  it
       is deleted.

       To activate a deactivated partner event source, use ActivateEventSource
       .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deactivate-event-source
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the partner event source to deactivate.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
