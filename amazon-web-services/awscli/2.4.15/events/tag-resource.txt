TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified EventBridge
       resource. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You
       can  also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permis-
       sion to access or change only resources with  certain  tag  values.  In
       EventBridge, rules and event buses can be tagged.

       Tags  don't  have  any  semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are
       interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

       You can use the TagResource action with a  resource  that  already  has
       tags. If you specify a new tag key, this tag is appended to the list of
       tags associated with the resource. If you specify a  tag  key  that  is
       already  associated with the resource, the new tag value that you spec-
       ify replaces the previous value for that tag.

       You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the EventBridge resource that you're adding tags to.

       --tags (list)
          The list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair  associated  with  an  Amazon  Web   Services
              resource. In EventBridge, rules and event buses support tagging.

              Key -> (string)
                 A string you can use to assign a value.  The  combination  of
                 tag keys and values can help you organize and categorize your
                 resources.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the specified tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
