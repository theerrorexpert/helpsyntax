REMOVE-TARGETS()                                              REMOVE-TARGETS()



NAME
       remove-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified targets from the specified rule. When the rule is
       triggered, those targets are no longer be invoked.

       When you remove a target, when the associated  rule  triggers,  removed
       targets  might continue to be invoked. Allow a short period of time for
       changes to take effect.

       This action can partially fail if too many requests  are  made  at  the
       same  time.  If  that  happens,  FailedEntryCount  is  non-zero  in the
       response and each entry in FailedEntries provides the ID of the  failed
       target and the error code.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            remove-targets
          --rule <value>
          [--event-bus-name <value>]
          --ids <value>
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The  name  or  ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --ids (list)
          The IDs of the targets to remove from the rule.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          If this is a managed rule, created by an Amazon Web Services service
          on  your  behalf,  you must specify Force as True to remove targets.
          This parameter is ignored for rules that are not managed rules.  You
          can  check whether a rule is a managed rule by using DescribeRule or
          ListRules and checking the ManagedBy field of the response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To remove a target for an event

       This example removes the Amazon Kinesis  stream  named  MyStream1  from
       being  a  target of the rule DailyLambdaFunction. When DailyLambdaFunc-
       tion was created, this stream was set as a target with an  ID  of  Tar-
       get1:

          aws events remove-targets --rule "DailyLambdaFunction" --ids "Target1"

OUTPUT
       FailedEntryCount -> (integer)
          The number of failed entries.

       FailedEntries -> (list)
          The failed target entries.

          (structure)
              Represents a target that failed to be removed from a rule.

              TargetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  error code that indicates why the target removal failed.
                 If the value is ConcurrentModificationException  ,  too  many
                 requests were made at the same time.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The  error  message  that  explains  why  the  target removal
                 failed.
