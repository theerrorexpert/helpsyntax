LIST-REPLAYS()                                                  LIST-REPLAYS()



NAME
       list-replays -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your replays. You can either list all the replays or you can pro-
       vide a prefix to match to  the  replay  names.  Filter  parameters  are
       exclusive.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-replays
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--state <value>]
          [--event-source-arn <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A name prefix to filter the replays returned. Only replays with name
          that match the prefix are returned.

       --state (string)
          The state of the replay.

          Possible values:

          o STARTING

          o RUNNING

          o CANCELLING

          o COMPLETED

          o CANCELLED

          o FAILED

       --event-source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the archive from which the events are replayed.

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned by a previous call to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of replays to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Replays -> (list)
          An  array  of  Replay  objects  that  contain  information about the
          replay.

          (structure)
              A Replay object that contains details about a replay.

              ReplayName -> (string)
                 The name of the replay.

              EventSourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the archive to replay event from.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the replay.

              StateReason -> (string)
                 A description of why the replay is in the current state.

              EventStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp for the time to start replaying events. This  is
                 determined by the time in the event as described in Time .

              EventEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  for  the  time to start replaying events. Any
                 event with a creation time prior to the  EventEndTime  speci-
                 fied is replayed.

              EventLastReplayedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp for the time that the last event was replayed.

              ReplayStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp for the time that the replay started.

              ReplayEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp for the time that the replay completed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  returned  by a previous call to retrieve the next set of
          results.
