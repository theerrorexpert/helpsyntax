CREATE-EVENT-BUS()                                          CREATE-EVENT-BUS()



NAME
       create-event-bus -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new event bus within your account. This can be a custom event
       bus which you can use to receive events from your  custom  applications
       and  services, or it can be a partner event bus which can be matched to
       a partner event source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-event-bus
          --name <value>
          [--event-source-name <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the new event bus.

          Event bus names cannot contain the / character. You  can't  use  the
          name  default  for  a custom event bus, as this name is already used
          for your account's default event bus.

          If this is a partner event bus, the name must exactly match the name
          of the partner event source that this event bus is matched to.

       --event-source-name (string)
          If  you are creating a partner event bus, this specifies the partner
          event source that the new event bus will be matched with.

       --tags (list)
          Tags to associate with the event bus.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair  associated  with  an  Amazon  Web   Services
              resource. In EventBridge, rules and event buses support tagging.

              Key -> (string)
                 A string you can use to assign a value.  The  combination  of
                 tag keys and values can help you organize and categorize your
                 resources.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the specified tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventBusArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the new event bus.
