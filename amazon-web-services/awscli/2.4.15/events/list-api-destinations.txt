NAME
       list-api-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of  API  destination  in the account in the current
       Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-api-destinations
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--connection-arn <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A name prefix to filter results returned. Only API destinations with
          a name that starts with the prefix are returned.

       --connection-arn (string)
          The ARN of the connection specified for the API destination.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  returned  by a previous call to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of API destinations to include in the response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
