DELETE-RULE()                                                    DELETE-RULE()



NAME
       delete-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified rule.

       Before  you  can  delete  the  rule, you must remove all targets, using
       RemoveTargets .

       When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to  the
       deleted  rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

       If you call delete rule multiple times for the  same  rule,  all  calls
       will  succeed.  When  you  call  delete  rule for a non-existent custom
       eventbus, ResourceNotFoundException is returned.

       Managed rules are rules created and managed by another Amazon Web  Ser-
       vices  service  on  your behalf. These rules are created by those other
       Amazon Web Services services to support  functionality  in  those  ser-
       vices.  You  can  delete  these  rules  using the Force option, but you
       should do so only if you are sure the other service is not still  using
       that rule.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-rule
          --name <value>
          [--event-bus-name <value>]
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The  name  or  ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          If this is a managed rule, created by an Amazon Web Services service
          on  your  behalf, you must specify Force as True to delete the rule.
          This parameter is ignored for rules that are not managed rules.  You
          can  check whether a rule is a managed rule by using DescribeRule or
          ListRules and checking the ManagedBy field of the response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
