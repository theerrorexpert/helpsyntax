       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-partner-event-source-accounts
          --event-source-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-source-name (string)
          The name of the partner event source to display account  information
          about.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token returned by a previous call to this operation. Specifying
          this retrieves the next set of results.

       --limit (integer)
          Specifying this limits the number of results returned by this opera-
          tion.  The operation also returns a NextToken which you can use in a
          subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PartnerEventSourceAccounts -> (list)
          The list of partner event sources returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              The Amazon Web Services account that a partner event source  has
              been offered to.

              Account -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  account ID that the partner event
                 source was offered to.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the event source was created.

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the event source will expire,  if  the
                 Amazon  Web  Services account doesn't create a matching event
                 bus for it.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the event source. If  it  is  ACTIVE,  you  have
                 already  created  a matching event bus for this event source,
                 and that event bus is active. If it is  PENDING,  either  you
                 haven't  yet  created a matching event bus, or that event bus
                 is deactivated. If it is DELETED, you have created a matching
                 event bus, but the event source has since been deleted.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next
          set of results.
