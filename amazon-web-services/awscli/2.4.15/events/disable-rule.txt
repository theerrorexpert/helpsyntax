DISABLE-RULE()                                                  DISABLE-RULE()



NAME
       disable-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  the  specified  rule. A disabled rule won't match any events,
       and won't self-trigger if it has a schedule expression.

       When you disable a rule, incoming events might continue to match to the
       disabled rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-rule
          --name <value>
          [--event-bus-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the  rule.  If  you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disable a CloudWatch Events rule

       This  example  disables the rule named DailyLambdaFunction. The rule is
       not deleted:

          aws events disable-rule --name "DailyLambdaFunction"

OUTPUT
       None



                                                                DISABLE-RULE()
