SEND-TASK-HEARTBEAT()                                    SEND-TASK-HEARTBEAT()



NAME
       send-task-heartbeat -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by activity workers and task states using the callback pattern to
       report to Step Functions that the task  represented  by  the  specified
       taskToken  is  still  making progress. This action resets the Heartbeat
       clock. The Heartbeat threshold is specified in the state machine's Ama-
       zon  States  Language  definition (HeartbeatSeconds ). This action does
       not in itself create an event in the execution history. However, if the
       task  times  out,  the  execution  history contains an ActivityTimedOut
       entry for activities, or a TaskTimedOut entry for for tasks  using  the
       job run or callback pattern.

       NOTE:
          The  Timeout of a task, defined in the state machine's Amazon States
          Language definition, is its maximum allowed duration, regardless  of
          the  number  of  SendTaskHeartbeat requests received. Use Heartbeat-
          Seconds to configure the timeout interval for heartbeats.

SYNOPSIS
            send-task-heartbeat
          --task-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-token (string)
          The token that represents this task. Task tokens  are  generated  by
          Step  Functions  when  tasks  are  assigned  to  a worker, or in the
          context object when a workflow enters a task state. See   GetActivi-
          tyTaskOutput$taskToken .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
