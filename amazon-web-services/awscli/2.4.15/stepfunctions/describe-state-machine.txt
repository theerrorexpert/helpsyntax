DESCRIPTION
       Describes a state machine.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-state-machine
          --state-machine-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       stateMachineArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the state machine.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the state machine.

          A name must not contain:

          o brackets < > { } [ ]

          o wildcard characters ? *

       roleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role  used  when  creating
          this  state  machine.  (The  IAM role maintains security by granting
          Step Functions access to AWS resources.)

       type -> (string)
          The type of the state machine (STANDARD or EXPRESS ).

       creationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the state machine is created.

       loggingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The LoggingConfiguration data type is used to  set  CloudWatch  Logs
          options.

          level -> (string)
              Defines which category of execution history events are logged.

          includeExecutionData -> (boolean)
              Determines  whether execution data is included in your log. When
              set to false , data is excluded.

          destinations -> (list)
              An array of objects that describes where your execution  history
              events  will be logged. Limited to size 1. Required, if your log
              level is not set to OFF .

              (structure)
                 cloudWatchLogsLogGroup -> (structure)
                     An object describing a CloudWatch  log  group.  For  more
                     information, see AWS::Logs::LogGroup in the AWS CloudFor-
                     mation User Guide.

                     logGroupArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the the CloudWatch log group to  which  you
