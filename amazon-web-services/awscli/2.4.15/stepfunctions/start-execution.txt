START-EXECUTION()                                            START-EXECUTION()



NAME
       start-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a state machine execution.

       NOTE:
          StartExecution  is  idempotent. If StartExecution is called with the
          same name and input as a running execution, the  call  will  succeed
          and  return the same response as the original request. If the execu-
          tion is closed or if the input is different, it will  return  a  400
          ExecutionAlreadyExists error. Names can be reused after 90 days.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-execution
          --state-machine-arn <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--input <value>]
          [--trace-header <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine to execute.

       --name (string)
          The  name  of  the  execution. This name must be unique for your AWS
          account, region, and state machine for 90 days.  For  more  informa-
          tion, see Limits Related to State Machine Executions in the AWS Step
          Functions Developer Guide .

          A name must not contain:

          o white space

          o brackets < > { } [ ]

          o wildcard characters ? *

          o special characters " # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /

          o control characters (U+0000-001F , U+007F-009F )

          To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should only contain
          0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

       --input (string)
          The  string that contains the JSON input data for the execution, for
          example:
              "input": "{\"first_name\" : \"test\"}"

          NOTE:
              If you don't include any JSON input data, you still must include
              the two braces, for example: "input": "{}"

          Length  constraints  apply to the payload size, and are expressed as
          bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

       --trace-header (string)
          Passes the AWS X-Ray trace header. The  trace  header  can  also  be
          passed in the request payload.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       executionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the execution.

       startDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the execution is started.
