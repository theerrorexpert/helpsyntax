GET-EXECUTION-HISTORY()                                GET-EXECUTION-HISTORY()



NAME
       get-execution-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the history of the specified execution as a list of events. By
       default, the results are returned in ascending order of  the  timeStamp
       of  the events. Use the reverseOrder parameter to get the latest events
       first.

       If nextToken is returned, there are more results available.  The  value
       of  nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call
       again using the returned token to retrieve  the  next  page.  Keep  all
       other  arguments  unchanged.  Each  pagination  token  expires after 24
       hours. Using an expired  pagination  token  will  return  an  HTTP  400
       InvalidToken error.

       This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-execution-history  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: events

SYNOPSIS
            get-execution-history
          --execution-arn <value>
          [--reverse-order | --no-reverse-order]
          [--include-execution-data | --no-include-execution-data]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution.

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          Lists events in descending order of their timeStamp .

       --include-execution-data | --no-include-execution-data (boolean)
          You can select whether execution data (input or output of a  history
          event) is returned. The default is true .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each  pagination  token  expires
          after  24  hours.  Using  an expired pagination token will return an
          HTTP 400 InvalidToken error.
