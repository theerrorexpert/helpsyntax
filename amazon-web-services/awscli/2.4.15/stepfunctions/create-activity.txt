CREATE-ACTIVITY()                                            CREATE-ACTIVITY()



NAME
       create-activity -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  activity. An activity is a task that you write in any pro-
       gramming language and host on any machine that has access to  AWS  Step
       Functions.  Activities  must poll Step Functions using the GetActivity-
       Task API action and respond using SendTask* API actions. This  function
       lets  Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an
       identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the  activ-
       ity.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       NOTE:
          CreateActivity is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests wont create
          a  duplicate  resource  if it was already created. CreateActivity 's
          idempotency check is based on the activity name  .  If  a  following
          request  has different tags values, Step Functions will ignore these
          differences and treat it as an idempotent request of  the  previous.
          In  this case, tags will not be updated, even if they are different.

SYNOPSIS
            create-activity
          --name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the activity to create. This name  must  be  unique  for
          your  AWS  account and region for 90 days. For more information, see
          Limits Related to State Machine Executions in the AWS Step Functions
          Developer Guide .

          A name must not contain:

          o white space

          o brackets < > { } [ ]

          o wildcard characters ? *

          o special characters " # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /

          o control characters (U+0000-001F , U+007F-009F )

          To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should only contain
          0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

       --tags (list)
          The list of tags to add to a resource.

          An array of key-value pairs. For more information,  see  Using  Cost
          Allocation  Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide ,
          and Controlling Access Using IAM Tags .

          Tags may only contain Unicode letters, digits, white space, or these
          symbols: _ . : / = + - @ .

          (structure)
              Tags  are key-value pairs that can be associated with Step Func-
              tions state machines and activities.

              An array of key-value pairs. For  more  information,  see  Using
              Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User
              Guide , and Controlling Access Using IAM Tags .

              Tags may only contain Unicode letters, digits, white  space,  or
              these symbols: _ . : / = + - @ .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of a tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of a tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       activityArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the created activity.

       creationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the activity is created.
