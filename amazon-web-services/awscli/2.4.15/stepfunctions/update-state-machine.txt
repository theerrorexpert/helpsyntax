UPDATE-STATE-MACHINE()                                  UPDATE-STATE-MACHINE()



NAME
       update-state-machine -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an existing state machine by modifying its definition , roleArn
       , or loggingConfiguration . Running executions will continue to use the
       previous definition and roleArn . You must include at least one of def-
       inition or roleArn  or  you  will  receive  a  MissingRequiredParameter
       error.

       NOTE:
          All  StartExecution  calls within a few seconds will use the updated
          definition and roleArn . Executions started immediately after  call-
          ing UpdateStateMachine may use the previous state machine definition
          and roleArn .

SYNOPSIS
            update-state-machine
          --state-machine-arn <value>
          [--definition <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--logging-configuration <value>]
          [--tracing-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine.

       --definition (string)
          The Amazon States Language definition  of  the  state  machine.  See
          Amazon States Language .

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role of the state machine.

       --logging-configuration (structure)
          The LoggingConfiguration data type is used to  set  CloudWatch  Logs
          options.

          level -> (string)
              Defines which category of execution history events are logged.

          includeExecutionData -> (boolean)
              Determines  whether execution data is included in your log. When
              set to false , data is excluded.

          destinations -> (list)
              An array of objects that describes where your execution  history
              events  will be logged. Limited to size 1. Required, if your log
              level is not set to OFF .

              (structure)
                 cloudWatchLogsLogGroup -> (structure)
                     An object describing a CloudWatch  log  group.  For  more
                     information, see AWS::Logs::LogGroup in the AWS CloudFor-
                     mation User Guide.

                     logGroupArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the the CloudWatch log group to  which  you
                        want your logs emitted to. The ARN must end with :*

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "level": "ALL"|"ERROR"|"FATAL"|"OFF",
            "includeExecutionData": true|false,
            "destinations": [
              {
                "cloudWatchLogsLogGroup": {
                  "logGroupArn": "string"
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --tracing-configuration (structure)
          Selects whether AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              When set to true , AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "enabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       updateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the state machine was updated.
