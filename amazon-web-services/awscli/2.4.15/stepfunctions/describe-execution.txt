NAME
       describe-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an execution.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-execution
          --execution-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       executionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the execution.

       stateMachineArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the executed stated machine.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the execution.

          A name must not contain:

          o white space

          o brackets < > { } [ ]

          o wildcard characters ? *

          o control characters (U+0000-001F , U+007F-009F )

          To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should only contain
          0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

       status -> (string)
          The current status of the execution.

       startDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the execution is started.

       stopDate -> (timestamp)
          If  the execution has already ended, the date the execution stopped.

       input -> (string)
          The string that contains the  JSON  input  data  of  the  execution.
          Length  constraints  apply to the payload size, and are expressed as
          bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

       inputDetails -> (structure)
          Provides details about execution input or output.

          included -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether input or output was included in the  response.
              Always true for API calls.

       output -> (string)
          The  JSON  output data of the execution. Length constraints apply to
          the payload size, and are expressed as bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

          NOTE:
              This field is set only if the execution succeeds. If the  execu-
              tion fails, this field is null.

       outputDetails -> (structure)
          Provides details about execution input or output.

          included -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether input or output was included in the response.
              Always true for API calls.

       traceHeader -> (string)
          The AWS X-Ray trace header that was passed to the execution.
