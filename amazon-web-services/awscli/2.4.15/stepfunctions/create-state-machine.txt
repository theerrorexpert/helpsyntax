CREATE-STATE-MACHINE()                                  CREATE-STATE-MACHINE()



NAME
       create-state-machine -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  state  machine. A state machine consists of a collection of
       states that can do work (Task states), determine  to  which  states  to
       transition  next (Choice states), stop an execution with an error (Fail
       states), and so on. State machines are specified  using  a  JSON-based,
       structured  language.  For more information, see Amazon States Language
       in the AWS Step Functions User Guide.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       NOTE:
          CreateStateMachine  is  an  idempotent API. Subsequent requests wont
          create a duplicate resource if  it  was  already  created.  CreateS-
          tateMachine  's idempotency check is based on the state machine name
          , definition , type , LoggingConfiguration and  TracingConfiguration
          .  If  a  following  request  has a different roleArn or tags , Step
          Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as  an  idempo-
          tent  request  of  the previous. In this case, roleArn and tags will
          not be updated, even if they are different.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to use for this state
          machine.

       --type (string)
          Determines  whether  a Standard or Express state machine is created.
          The default is STANDARD . You cannot update  the  type  of  a  state
          machine once it has been created.

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o EXPRESS

       --logging-configuration (structure)

          includeExecutionData -> (boolean)
              Determines  whether execution data is included in your log. When
              set to false , data is excluded.

          destinations -> (list)
              An array of objects that describes where your execution  history
              events  will be logged. Limited to size 1. Required, if your log
              level is not set to OFF .

              (structure)
                 cloudWatchLogsLogGroup -> (structure)
                     An object describing a CloudWatch  log  group.  For  more
                     information, see AWS::Logs::LogGroup in the AWS CloudFor-
                     mation User Guide.

                     logGroupArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the the CloudWatch log group to  which  you
                        want your logs emitted to. The ARN must end with :*

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "level": "ALL"|"ERROR"|"FATAL"|"OFF",
            "includeExecutionData": true|false,
            "destinations": [
              {
                "cloudWatchLogsLogGroup": {
                  "logGroupArn": "string"
                }
              }

            ]
          }

       --tags (list)
          Tags to be added when creating a state machine.

          An  array  of  key-value pairs. For more information, see Using Cost
          Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide  ,
          and Controlling Access Using IAM Tags .

          Tags may only contain Unicode letters, digits, white space, or these
          symbols: _ . : / = + - @ .

          (structure)
              Tags are key-value pairs that can be associated with Step  Func-
              tions state machines and activities.

              An  array  of  key-value  pairs. For more information, see Using
              Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User
              Guide , and Controlling Access Using IAM Tags .

              Tags  may  only contain Unicode letters, digits, white space, or
              these symbols: _ . : / = + - @ .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of a tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of a tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tracing-configuration (structure)
          Selects whether AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              When set to true , AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "enabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       stateMachineArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  identifies  the  created  state
          machine.

       creationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the state machine is created.
