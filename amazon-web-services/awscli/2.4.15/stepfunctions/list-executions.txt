LIST-EXECUTIONS()                                            LIST-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the executions of a state machine that meet the filtering crite-
       ria. Results are sorted by time, with the most recent execution  first.

       If  nextToken  is returned, there are more results available. The value
       of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the  call
       again  using  the  returned  token  to retrieve the next page. Keep all
       other arguments unchanged.  Each  pagination  token  expires  after  24
       hours.  Using  an  expired  pagination  token  will  return an HTTP 400
       InvalidToken error.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-executions  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: executions

SYNOPSIS
            list-executions
          --state-machine-arn <value>
          [--status-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine whose executions
          is listed.

       --status-filter (string)
          If  specified, only list the executions whose current execution sta-
          tus matches the given filter.

          Possible values:

          o RUNNING

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

          o TIMED_OUT

          o ABORTED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       executions -> (list)
          The list of matching executions.

          (structure)
              Contains details about an execution.

              executionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the execution.

              stateMachineArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the executed state machine.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the execution.

                 A name must not contain:

                 o white space

                 o brackets < > { } [ ]

                 o wildcard characters ? *

                 o special characters " # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /

                 o control characters (U+0000-001F , U+007F-009F )

                 To  enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should only
                 contain 0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the execution.

              startDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the execution started.

              stopDate -> (timestamp)
                 If the  execution  already  ended,  the  date  the  execution
                 stopped.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  nextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
          value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the  call  again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each  pagination  token  expires
          after  24  hours.  Using  an expired pagination token will return an
          HTTP 400 InvalidToken error.
