NAME
       describe-state-machine-for-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the state machine associated with a specific execution.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-state-machine-for-execution
          --execution-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  execution  you  want  state
          machine information for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       stateMachineArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine associated with
          the execution.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the state machine associated with the execution.

       definition -> (string)
          The Amazon States Language definition  of  the  state  machine.  See
          Amazon States Language .

       roleArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role of the State Machine
          for the execution.

       updateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the state machine associated with an execution was
          updated.  For  a  newly  created state machine, this is the creation
          date.

       loggingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The LoggingConfiguration data type is used to  set  CloudWatch  Logs
          options.

          level -> (string)
              Defines which category of execution history events are logged.

          includeExecutionData -> (boolean)
              Determines  whether execution data is included in your log. When
              set to false , data is excluded.

          destinations -> (list)
              An array of objects that describes where your execution  history
              events  will be logged. Limited to size 1. Required, if your log
              level is not set to OFF .

              (structure)
                 cloudWatchLogsLogGroup -> (structure)
                     An object describing a CloudWatch  log  group.  For  more
                     information, see AWS::Logs::LogGroup in the AWS CloudFor-
                     mation User Guide.

                     logGroupArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the the CloudWatch log group to  which  you
                        want your logs emitted to. The ARN must end with :*

       tracingConfiguration -> (structure)
          Selects whether AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              When set to true , AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.
