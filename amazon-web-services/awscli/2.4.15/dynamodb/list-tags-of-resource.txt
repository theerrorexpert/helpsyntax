LIST-TAGS-OF-RESOURCE()                                LIST-TAGS-OF-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-of-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all  tags  on  an Amazon DynamoDB resource. You can call ListTag-
       sOfResource up to 10 times per second, per account.

       For an overview on tagging DynamoDB resources, see Tagging for DynamoDB
       in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tags-of-resource  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Tags

SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-of-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon DynamoDB resource with tags to be listed. This  value  is
          an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list tags of a DynamoDB resource

       The  following list-tags-of-resource example displays tags for the Mus-
       icCollection table.

          aws dynamodb list-tags-of-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection

       Output:

          {
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "Key": "Owner",
                      "Value": "blueTeam"
                  },
                  {
                      "Key": "Environment",
                      "Value": "Production"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Tagging for DynamoDB in the  Amazon  DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

       Example 2: To limit the number of tags returned

       The  following  example  limits  the  number of tags returned to 1. The
       response includes a NextToken value with which  to  retrieve  the  next
       page of results.

          aws dynamodb list-tags-of-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection \
              --max-items 1

       Output:

          {
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "Key": "Owner",
                      "Value": "blueTeam"
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9"
          }

       Developer Guide.

       Example 3: To retrieve the next page of results

       The following command uses the NextToken value from a previous call  to
       the  list-tags-of-resource command to retrieve another page of results.
       Since the response in this case does not include a NextToken value,  we
       know that we have reached the end of the results.

          aws dynamodb list-tags-of-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection \
              --starting-token abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9

       Output:

          {
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "Key": "Environment",
                      "Value": "Production"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          The tags currently associated with the Amazon DynamoDB resource.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag. A tag is a key-value pair. You can add up to 50
              tags to a single DynamoDB table.

              Amazon  Web Services-assigned tag names and values are automati-
              cally assigned the aws: prefix, which the  user  cannot  assign.
              Amazon  Web Services-assigned tag names do not count towards the
              tag limit of 50. User-assigned tag names have the  prefix  user:
              in  the Cost Allocation Report. You cannot backdate the applica-
              tion of a tag.

              For an overview on tagging DynamoDB resources, see  Tagging  for
              DynamoDB in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  of  the  tag.  Tag  keys  are  case sensitive. Each
                 DynamoDB table can only have up to one tag with the same key.
                 If  you  try  to add an existing tag (same key), the existing
                 tag value will be updated to the new value.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag. Tag values are case-sensitive  and  can
                 be null.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  this  value is returned, there are additional results to be dis-
          played. To retrieve them, call ListTagsOfResource again, with  Next-
          Token set to this value.
