DESCRIBE-GLOBAL-TABLE()                                DESCRIBE-GLOBAL-TABLE()



NAME
       describe-global-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the specified global table.

       NOTE:
          This  operation only applies to Version 2017.11.29 of global tables.
          If you are using  global  tables  Version  2019.11.21  you  can  use
          DescribeTable instead.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-global-table
          --global-table-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-table-name (string)
          The name of the global table.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To display information about a DynamoDB global table

       The  following describe-global-table example displays details about the
       MusicCollection global table.

          aws dynamodb describe-global-table \
              --global-table-name MusicCollection

       Output:

          {
              "GlobalTableDescription": {
                  "ReplicationGroup": [
                      {
                          "RegionName": "us-east-2"
                      },
                      {
                          "RegionName": "us-east-1"
                      }
                  ],
                  "GlobalTableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb::123456789012:global-table/MusicCollection",
                  "CreationDateTime": 1576625818.532,
                  "GlobalTableStatus": "ACTIVE",
                  "GlobalTableName": "MusicCollection"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       GlobalTableDescription -> (structure)
          Contains the details of the global table.

          ReplicationGroup -> (list)
              The Regions where the global table has replicas.

              (structure)
                 Contains the details of the replica.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The name of the Region.

                 ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the replica:

                     o CREATING - The replica is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The replica is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The replica is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The replica is ready for use.

                     o REGION_DISABLED  -  The replica is inaccessible because
                       the Amazon Web Services Region has been disabled.

                     NOTE:
                        If the Amazon Web Services Region remains inaccessible
                        for  more  than  20  hours,  DynamoDB will remove this
                        replica from the replication group. The  replica  will
                        not  be  deleted and replication will stop from and to
                        this region.

                     o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS - The KMS key  used
                       to encrypt the table is inaccessible.

                     NOTE:
                        If  the  KMS key remains inaccessible for more than 20
                        hours, DynamoDB will  remove  this  replica  from  the
                        replication group. The replica will not be deleted and
                        replication will stop from and to this region.

                 ReplicaStatusDescription -> (string)
                     Detailed information about the replica status.

                 ReplicaStatusPercentProgress -> (string)
                     Specifies the progress of a  Create,  Update,  or  Delete

                     encryption.

                 ProvisionedThroughputOverride -> (structure)
                     Replica-specific   provisioned   throughput.    If    not

                     settings.

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        Replica-specific read capacity units.  If  not  speci-

                 GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
                     Replica-specific global secondary index settings.
