DESCRIBE-EXPORT()                                            DESCRIBE-EXPORT()



NAME
       describe-export -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an existing table export.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-export
          --export-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the export.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExportDescription -> (structure)
          Represents the properties of the export.

          ExportArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table export.

          ExportStatus -> (string)
              Export  can be in one of the following states: IN_PROGRESS, COM-
              PLETED, or FAILED.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the export task began.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the export task completed.

          ExportManifest -> (string)
              The name of the manifest file for the export task.

          TableArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table that was exported.

          TableId -> (string)
              Unique ID of the table that was exported.

          ExportTime -> (timestamp)
              Point in time from which table data was exported.

          ClientToken -> (string)
              The client token that was provided for the export task. A client
              token  makes  calls to ExportTableToPointInTimeInput idempotent,
              meaning that multiple identical calls have the  same  effect  as
              one single call.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket containing the export.

          S3BucketOwner -> (string)
              The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket
              containing the export.

          S3Prefix -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket prefix used as the file name  and  path  of
              the exported snapshot.

          S3SseAlgorithm -> (string)
              Type  of  encryption  used  on  the  bucket where export data is
              stored. Valid values for S3SseAlgorithm are:

              o AES256 - server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys

              o KMS - server-side encryption with KMS managed keys

          S3SseKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The ID of the KMS managed key used  to  encrypt  the  S3  bucket
              where export data is stored (if applicable).

          FailureCode -> (string)
              Status code for the result of the failed export.

          FailureMessage -> (string)
              Export failure reason description.

          ExportFormat -> (string)
              The  format  of the exported data. Valid values for ExportFormat
              are DYNAMODB_JSON or ION .

          BilledSizeBytes -> (long)
              The billable size of the table export.

          ItemCount -> (long)
              The number of items exported.
