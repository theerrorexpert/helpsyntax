CREATE-BACKUP()                                                CREATE-BACKUP()



NAME
       create-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a backup for an existing table.

       Each  time  you  create  an  on-demand backup, the entire table data is
       backed up. There is no limit to the number of  on-demand  backups  that
       can be taken.

       When  you  create  an on-demand backup, a time marker of the request is
       cataloged, and the backup is created asynchronously,  by  applying  all
       changes  until the time of the request to the last full table snapshot.
       Backup requests are processed instantaneously and become available  for
       restore within minutes.

       You can call CreateBackup at a maximum rate of 50 times per second.

       All backups in DynamoDB work without consuming any provisioned through-
       put on the table.

       If you submit a backup request on 2018-12-14 at 14:25:00, the backup is
       guaranteed  to  contain all data committed to the table up to 14:24:00,
       and data committed after 14:26:00 will not be. The backup might contain
       data modifications made between 14:24:00 and 14:26:00. On-demand backup
       does not support causal consistency.

       Along with data, the following are also included on the backups:

       o Global secondary indexes (GSIs)

       o Local secondary indexes (LSIs)

       o Streams

       o Provisioned read and write capacity

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-backup
          --table-name <value>
          --backup-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table.

       --backup-name (string)
          Specified name for the backup.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a backup for an existing DynamoDB table

       The following create-backup example creates a backup of  the  MusicCol-
       lection table.

          aws dynamodb create-backup \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --backup-name MusicCollectionBackup

       Output:

          {
              "BackupDetails": {
                  "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01576616366715-b4e58d3a",
                  "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup",
                  "BackupSizeBytes": 0,
                  "BackupStatus": "CREATING",
                  "BackupType": "USER",
                  "BackupCreationDateTime": 1576616366.715
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       BackupDetails -> (structure)
          Contains the details of the backup created for the table.

          BackupArn -> (string)
              ARN associated with the backup.

          BackupName -> (string)
              Name of the requested backup.

          BackupSizeBytes -> (long)
              Size of the backup in bytes.

          BackupStatus -> (string)
              Backup can be in one of the following states: CREATING,  ACTIVE,
              DELETED.

          BackupType -> (string)
              BackupType:

              o USER  - You create and manage these using the on-demand backup
                feature.

              o SYSTEM - If you delete a  table  with  point-in-time  recovery
                enabled,  a  SYSTEM  backup  is  automatically  created and is
                retained for 35 days (at no additional cost).  System  backups
                allow  you to restore the deleted table to the state it was in
                just before the point of deletion.

              o AWS_BACKUP - On-demand backup created by you from Backup  ser-
                vice.

          BackupCreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              Time  at  which the backup was created. This is the request time
              of the backup.

          BackupExpiryDateTime -> (timestamp)
              Time at which the automatic on-demand backup created by DynamoDB
              will  expire. This SYSTEM on-demand backup expires automatically
              35 days after its creation.
