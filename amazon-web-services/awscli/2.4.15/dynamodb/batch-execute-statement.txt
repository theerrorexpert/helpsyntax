BATCH-EXECUTE-STATEMENT()                            BATCH-EXECUTE-STATEMENT()



NAME
       batch-execute-statement -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  allows  you  to  perform batch reads or writes on data
       stored in DynamoDB, using PartiQL.

       NOTE:
          The entire batch must consist of either  read  statements  or  write
          statements, you cannot mix both in one batch.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-execute-statement
          --statements <value>
          [--return-consumed-capacity <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --statements (list)
          The list of PartiQL statements representing the batch to run.

          (structure)
              A PartiQL batch statement request.

              Statement -> (string)
                 A valid PartiQL statement.

              Parameters -> (list)
                 The  parameters  associated  with  a PartiQL statement in the
                 batch request.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name  is  the  data  type, and the value is the data
                     itself.

                     DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     S -> (string)
                        An attribute of type String. For example:
                            "S": "Hello"

                     N -> (string)
                        An attribute of type Number. For example:
                            "N": "123.45"

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     B -> (blob)
                        An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                            "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                     SS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                            "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                        (string)

                     NS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                            "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                        Numbers are sent across the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                        strings,  to  maximize  compatibility across languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                        (string)

                     BS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:

                        (blob)

                     M -> (map)
                        An attribute of type Map. For example:
                            "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each  attribute value is described as a name-value
                            pair. The name is the data type, and the value  is
                            the data itself.

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

          o INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for
            the operation, together with ConsumedCapacity for each  table  and
            secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such
            as GetItem and BatchGetItem , do not access any indexes at all. In
            these  cases, specifying INDEXES will only return ConsumedCapacity
            information for table(s).

          o TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate  ConsumedCapacity
            for the operation.

          o NONE - No ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name  is  the  data  type, and the value is the data
                     itself.
