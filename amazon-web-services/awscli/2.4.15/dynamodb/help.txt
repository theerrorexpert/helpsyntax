NAME
       dynamodb -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides
       fast and predictable performance with  seamless  scalability.  DynamoDB
       lets  you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a
       distributed database, so that you don't have to  worry  about  hardware
       provisioning,  setup and configuration, replication, software patching,
       or cluster scaling.

       With DynamoDB, you can  create  database  tables  that  can  store  and
       retrieve  any  amount  of data, and serve any level of request traffic.
       You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without
       downtime  or  performance  degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services
       Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance met-
       rics.

       DynamoDB  automatically  spreads  the  data and traffic for your tables
       over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and stor-
       age  requirements,  while  maintaining consistent and fast performance.
       All of your data is stored on solid state disks  (SSDs)  and  automati-
       cally  replicated  across  multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web
       Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durabil-
       ity.
