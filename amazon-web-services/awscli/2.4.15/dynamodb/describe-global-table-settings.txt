NAME
       describe-global-table-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes Region-specific settings for a global table.

       NOTE:
          This  operation only applies to Version 2017.11.29 of global tables.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-global-table-settings
          --global-table-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-table-name (string)
          The name of the global table to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a DynamoDB global table's settings

       The following describe-global-table-settings example displays the  set-
       tings for the MusicCollection global table.

          aws dynamodb describe-global-table-settings \
              --global-table-name MusicCollection

OUTPUT
       GlobalTableName -> (string)
          The name of the global table.

       ReplicaSettings -> (list)
          The Region-specific settings for the global table.

          (structure)
              Represents the properties of a replica.

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The Region name of the replica.

              ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                 The current state of the Region:

                 o CREATING - The Region is being created.

                 o UPDATING - The Region is being updated.

                 o DELETING - The Region is being deleted.

                 o ACTIVE - The Region is ready for use.

              ReplicaBillingModeSummary -> (structure)
                 The read/write capacity mode of the replica.

                 BillingMode -> (string)
                     Controls how you are charged for read and write  through-
                     put  and  how  you  manage  capacity. This setting can be
                     changed later.

                     o PROVISIONED - Sets the read/write capacity mode to PRO-
                       VISIONED  .  We  recommend  using  PROVISIONED for pre-

                 LastUpdateToPayPerRequestDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     Represents the time when PAY_PER_REQUEST was last set  as

                 The  maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per
                 second before DynamoDB returns a  ThrottlingException  .  For
                 more  information, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements
                 in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              ReplicaProvisionedReadCapacityAutoScalingSettings -> (structure)
                 Auto  scaling  settings  for  a  global  table replica's read

                     secondary index should be scaled up to.

                 AutoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Disabled auto scaling for this  global  table  or  global

                 ScalingPolicies -> (list)
                     Information about the scaling policies.

                     (structure)
                        Represents the properties of the scaling policy.

                        PolicyName -> (string)
                            The name of the scaling policy.

                        TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration   ->  (struc-
                        ture)
                            Represents a target tracking scaling  policy  con-
                            figuration.

                            DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether scale in by the target track-
                               ing policy is disabled. If the value  is  true,
                               scale  in  is  disabled and the target tracking
                               policy won't remove capacity from the  scalable
                               resource.  Otherwise,  scale  in is enabled and
                               the target tracking policy can remove  capacity
                               from  the  scalable resource. The default value
                               is false.

                            ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                               The amount of time, in seconds, after  a  scale
                               in  activity  completes before another scale in
                               activity can start. The cooldown period is used
                               to  block subsequent scale in requests until it
                               has expired. You should scale in conservatively
                               to  protect  your  application's  availability.
                               However, if another alarm triggers a scale  out
                               policy  during  the  cooldown  period  after  a
                               scale-in, application auto scaling  scales  out
                               your scalable target immediately.

                            ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                               The  amount  of time, in seconds, after a scale
                               out activity completes before another scale out
                               activity  can  start. While the cooldown period
                               is in effect, the capacity that has been  added
                               by  the previous scale out event that initiated
                               the cooldown  is  calculated  as  part  of  the
                               desired  capacity  for  the next scale out. You
                               should continuously (but not excessively) scale
                               out.

                            TargetValue -> (double)
                               The  target  value for the metric. The range is
                               8.515920e-109 to  1.174271e+108  (Base  10)  or
                               2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

              ReplicaProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The  maximum  number  of  writes  consumed  per second before
                 DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException .  For  more  informa-

                     Disabled auto scaling for this  global  table  or  global
                     secondary index.

                 AutoScalingRoleArn -> (string)
                     Role ARN used for configuring the auto scaling policy.

                               ing policy is disabled. If the value  is  true,
                               scale  in  is  disabled and the target tracking
                               policy won't remove capacity from the  scalable
                               resource.  Otherwise,  scale  in is enabled and
                               the target tracking policy can remove  capacity
                               from  the  scalable resource. The default value
                               is false.

                               your scalable target immediately.

                            ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)

                                      Indicates whether scale in by the target
                                      tracking  policy  is  disabled.  If  the
