LIST-TABLES()                                                    LIST-TABLES()



NAME
       list-tables -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of table names associated with the current account and
       endpoint. The output from  ListTables  is  paginated,  with  each  page
       returning a maximum of 100 table names.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tables  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: TableNames

SYNOPSIS
            list-tables
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list tables

       The  following  list-tables  example lists all of the tables associated
       with the current AWS account and Region.

          aws dynamodb list-tables

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Forum",
                  "ProductCatalog",
                  "Reply",
                  "Thread"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Listing Table Names in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

       Example 2: To limit page size

       The  following  example  returns  a  list  of  all existing tables, but
       retrieves only one item in each call, performing multiple calls if nec-
       essary  to  get  the entire list. Limiting the page size is useful when
       running list commands on a large number of resources, which can  result
       in a "timed out" error when using the default page size of 1000.

          aws dynamodb list-tables \
              --page-size 1

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Forum",
                  "ProductCatalog",
                  "Reply",
                  "Thread"
              ]
          }

       For  more  information,  see Listing Table Names in the Amazon DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

       Example 3: To limit the number of items returned

       The following example limits the number of items  returned  to  2.  The
       response  includes  a  NextToken  value with which to retrieve the next
       page of results.

          aws dynamodb list-tables \
              --max-items 2

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Forum",
                  "ProductCatalog"
              ],
              "NextToken": "abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9"
          }

       Developer Guide.

       Example 4: To retrieve the next page of results

       The  following command uses the NextToken value from a previous call to
       the list-tables command to retrieve another page of results. Since  the
       response  in this case does not include a NextToken value, we know that
       we have reached the end of the results.

          aws dynamodb list-tables \
              --starting-token abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Reply",
                  "Thread"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Listing Table Names in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       TableNames -> (list)
          The  names  of the tables associated with the current account at the
          current endpoint. The maximum size of this array is 100.

          If LastEvaluatedTableName also appears in the output,  you  can  use
          this  value as the ExclusiveStartTableName parameter in a subsequent
          ListTables request and obtain the next page of results.

          (string)

       LastEvaluatedTableName -> (string)
          The name of the last table in the current page of results. Use  this
          value  as the ExclusiveStartTableName in a new request to obtain the
          next page of results, until all the table names are returned.

          If  you  do  not  receive  a  LastEvaluatedTableName  value  in  the
          response,  this  means  that  there  are  no  more table names to be
          retrieved.
