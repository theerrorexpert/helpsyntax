UPDATE-CONTINUOUS-BACKUPS()                        UPDATE-CONTINUOUS-BACKUPS()



NAME
       update-continuous-backups -

DESCRIPTION
          UpdateContinuousBackups  enables  or disables point in time recovery
          for the specified table. A successful  UpdateContinuousBackups  call
          returns  the current ContinuousBackupsDescription . Continuous back-
          ups are ENABLED on all tables at table creation. If  point  in  time
          recovery  is  enabled,  PointInTimeRecoveryStatus  will  be  set  to
          ENABLED.

       Once continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can
       restore to any point in time within EarliestRestorableDateTime and Lat-
       estRestorableDateTime .
          LatestRestorableDateTime is typically 5 minutes before  the  current
          time.  You  can  restore  your table to any point in time during the
          last 35 days.

SYNOPSIS
            update-continuous-backups
          --table-name <value>
          --point-in-time-recovery-specification <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table.

       --point-in-time-recovery-specification (structure)
          Represents the settings used to enable point in time recovery.

          PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether point in time recovery is  enabled  (true)  or
              disabled (false) on the table.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To update continuous backup settings for a DynamoDB table

       The  following  update-continuous-backups example enables point-in-time
       recovery for the MusicCollection table.

          aws dynamodb update-continuous-backups \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --point-in-time-recovery-specification PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled=true

       Output:

          {
              "ContinuousBackupsDescription": {
                  "ContinuousBackupsStatus": "ENABLED",
                  "PointInTimeRecoveryDescription": {
                      "PointInTimeRecoveryStatus": "ENABLED",
                      "EarliestRestorableDateTime": 1576622404.0,
                      "LatestRestorableDateTime": 1576622404.0
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ContinuousBackupsDescription -> (structure)
          Represents  the  continuous  backups and point in time recovery set-
          tings on the table.

          ContinuousBackupsStatus -> (string)
              ContinuousBackupsStatus can be  one  of  the  following  states:
              ENABLED, DISABLED

          PointInTimeRecoveryDescription -> (structure)
              The  description  of the point in time recovery settings applied
              to the table.

              PointInTimeRecoveryStatus -> (string)
                 The current state of point in time recovery:

                 o ENABLING - Point in time recovery is being enabled.

                 o ENABLED - Point in time recovery is enabled.

                 o DISABLED - Point in time recovery is disabled.

              EarliestRestorableDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the earliest point in time you can restore your ta-
                 ble  to. You can restore your table to any point in time dur-
                 ing the last 35 days.

              LatestRestorableDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 LatestRestorableDateTime is typically 5  minutes  before  the
                 current time.
