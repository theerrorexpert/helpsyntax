NAME
       describe-table-replica-auto-scaling -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  auto scaling settings across replicas of the global table at
       once.

       NOTE:
          This operation only applies to Version 2019.11.21 of global  tables.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-table-replica-auto-scaling
          --table-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view auto scaling settings across replicas of a global table

       The following describe-table-replica-auto-scaling example displays auto
       scaling settings across replicas of the MusicCollection global table.

          aws dynamodb describe-table-replica-auto-scaling \
              --table-name MusicCollection

                                      DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                                          Indicates  whether  scale  in by the
                                          target tracking policy is  disabled.
                                          If  the  value  is true, scale in is
                                          disabled  and  the  target  tracking
                                          policy  won't  remove  capacity from
                                          the  scalable  resource.  Otherwise,
                                          scale  in  is enabled and the target
                                          tracking policy can remove  capacity
                                          from   the  scalable  resource.  The
                                          default value is false.

                                      ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                                          The  amount  of  time,  in  seconds,
                                          after  a scale in activity completes
                                          before another scale in activity can
                                          start.  The  cooldown period is used
                                          to   block   subsequent   scale   in
                                          requests  until  it has expired. You
                                          should scale  in  conservatively  to
                                          protect  your  application's  avail-
                                          ability. However, if  another  alarm
                                          triggers  a  scale out policy during
                                          the   cooldown   period   after    a
                                          scale-in,  application  auto scaling
                                          scales  out  your  scalable   target
                                          immediately.

                                      ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                                          The  amount  of  time,  in  seconds,
                                          after a scale out activity completes
                                          before  another  scale  out activity
                                          can start. While the cooldown period
                                          is  in effect, the capacity that has
                                          been added by the previous scale out
                                          event that initiated the cooldown is
                                          calculated as part  of  the  desired
                                          capacity for the next scale out. You
                                          should continuously (but not  exces-
                                          sively) scale out.

                                      TargetValue -> (double)
                                          The target value for the metric. The
                                          range    is     8.515920e-109     to
                                          1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360 to
                                          2e360 (Base 2).

                        ProvisionedWriteCapacityAutoScalingSettings -> (struc-
                        ture)
                            Represents  the auto scaling settings for a global
                            table or global secondary index.

                            MinimumUnits -> (long)
                               The minimum capacity units that a global  table
                               or global secondary index should be scaled down
                               to.

                            MaximumUnits -> (long)
                               The maximum capacity units that a global  table
                               or  global  secondary index should be scaled up
                               to.

                                          If  the  value  is true, scale in is

                                          before another scale in activity can
                                          start.  The  cooldown period is used
                                          to   block   subsequent   scale   in
                                          requests  until  it has expired. You

                                          can start. While the cooldown period
                                          is  in effect, the capacity that has
                                          been added by the previous scale out
                                          event that initiated the cooldown is
                                          calculated as part  of  the  desired
                                          capacity for the next scale out. You
                                          should continuously (but not  exces-
