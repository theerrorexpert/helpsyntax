DESCRIBE-LIMITS()                                            DESCRIBE-LIMITS()



NAME
       describe-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  current  provisioned-capacity  quotas for your Amazon Web
       Services account in a Region, both for the Region as a  whole  and  for
       any one DynamoDB table that you create there.

       When you establish an Amazon Web Services account, the account has ini-
       tial quotas on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units
       that  you  can  provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given
       Region. Also, there are per-table quotas that apply when you  create  a
       table there. For more information, see Service, Account, and Table Quo-
       tas page in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at  Amazon  Web
       Services  Support Center , obtaining the increase is not instantaneous.
       The DescribeLimits action lets you write code to compare  the  capacity
       you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that
       you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota.

       For example, you could use one of the Amazon Web Services  SDKs  to  do
       the following:

       o Call  DescribeLimits  for  a particular Region to obtain your current
         account quotas on provisioned capacity there.

       o Create a variable to hold the aggregate read  capacity  units  provi-
         sioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggre-
         gate write capacity units. Zero them both.

       o Call ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.

       o For each table name listed by ListTables , do the following:

         o Call DescribeTable with the table name.

         o Use the data returned by DescribeTable to  add  the  read  capacity
           units  and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to
           your variables.

         o If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs),  loop
           over  these  GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your
           variables as well.

       o Report the account quotas for that Region returned by  DescribeLimits
         ,  along  with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have
         calculated.

       This  will  let  you  see  whether  you  are  getting  close  to   your
       account-level quotas.

       The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They
       restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the  new  table  itself
       and all its global secondary indexes.

       For  existing  tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase
       provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies
       is  that  the  aggregate  provisioned capacity over all your tables and
       GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account quotas.

       NOTE:
          DescribeLimits should only be called periodically.  You  can  expect
          throttling errors if you call it more than once in a minute.

       The DescribeLimits Request element has no content.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-limits
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view provisioned-capacity limits

       The  following  describe-limits  example  displays provisioned-capacity
       limits for your account in the current AWS Region.

          aws dynamodb describe-limits

       Output:

          {
              "AccountMaxReadCapacityUnits": 80000,
              "AccountMaxWriteCapacityUnits": 80000,
              "TableMaxReadCapacityUnits": 40000,
              "TableMaxWriteCapacityUnits": 40000
          }

       For more information, see Limits in DynamoDB  in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       AccountMaxReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
          The  maximum  total read capacity units that your account allows you
          to provision across all of your tables in this Region.

       AccountMaxWriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
          The maximum total write capacity units that your account allows  you
          to provision across all of your tables in this Region.

       TableMaxReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
          The maximum read capacity units that your account allows you to pro-
          vision for a new table that you are creating in this Region, includ-
          ing  the  read  capacity  units provisioned for its global secondary
          indexes (GSIs).

       TableMaxWriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
          The maximum write capacity units that your  account  allows  you  to
          provision  for  a  new  table  that you are creating in this Region,
          including the write capacity units provisioned for its  global  sec-
          ondary indexes (GSIs).
