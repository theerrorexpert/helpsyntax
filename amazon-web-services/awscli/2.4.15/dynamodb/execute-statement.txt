EXECUTE-STATEMENT()                                        EXECUTE-STATEMENT()



NAME
       execute-statement -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation allows you to perform reads and singleton writes on data
       stored in DynamoDB, using PartiQL.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            execute-statement
          --statement <value>
          [--parameters <value>]
          [--consistent-read | --no-consistent-read]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--return-consumed-capacity <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --statement (string)
          The PartiQL statement representing the operation to run.

       --parameters (list)
          The parameters for the PartiQL statement, if any.

          (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For  more  information,  see  Data  Types in the Amazon DynamoDB
              Developer Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:
                     "S": "Hello"

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                     "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

                 (string)

              BS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                     "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name  is  the  data  type, and the value is the data
                     itself.

       --consistent-read | --no-consistent-read (boolean)
          The  consistency  of  a  read  operation.  If  set  to true , then a
          strongly consistent read is used; otherwise, an  eventually  consis-
          tent read is used.

       --next-token (string)
          Set  this  value to get remaining results, if NextToken was returned
          in the statement response.

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

          o INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for
            the operation, together with ConsumedCapacity for each  table  and
            secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such
            as GetItem and BatchGetItem , do not access any indexes at all. In
            these  cases, specifying INDEXES will only return ConsumedCapacity
            information for table(s).

          o TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate  ConsumedCapacity
            for the operation.

          o NONE - No ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          If  a read operation was used, this property will contain the result
          of the read operation; a map of attribute names  and  their  values.
          For the write operations this value will be empty.

          (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for an attribute.

                 Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair. The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                 For more information, see Data Types in the  Amazon  DynamoDB
                 Developer Guide .

                 S -> (string)
                     An attribute of type String. For example:
                        "S": "Hello"

                 N -> (string)
                     An attribute of type Number. For example:
                        "N": "123.45"

                     Numbers  are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB as
                     strings, to maximize compatibility across  languages  and
                     libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats them as number type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                 B -> (blob)
                     An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                        "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                 SS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                        "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                     (string)

                 NS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                        "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                     Numbers are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                     strings,  to  maximize compatibility across languages and
                     libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as  number  type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.
