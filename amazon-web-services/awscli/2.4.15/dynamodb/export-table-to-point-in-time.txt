EXPORT-TABLE-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()                EXPORT-TABLE-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()



NAME
       export-table-to-point-in-time -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  table  data to an S3 bucket. The table must have point in time
       recovery enabled, and you can export data  from  any  time  within  the
       point in time recovery window.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            export-table-to-point-in-time
          --table-arn <value>
          [--export-time <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --s3-bucket <value>
          [--s3-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--s3-prefix <value>]
          [--s3-sse-algorithm <value>]
          [--s3-sse-kms-key-id <value>]
          [--export-format <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the table to export.

       --export-time (timestamp)
          Time in the past from which to export table data. The  table  export
          will be a snapshot of the table's state at this point in time.

       --client-token (string)
          Providing  a  ClientToken  makes  the  call to ExportTableToPointIn-
          TimeInput idempotent, meaning that multiple identical calls have the
          same effect as one single call.

          A  client  token  is  valid for 8 hours after the first request that
          uses it is completed. After 8  hours,  any  request  with  the  same
          client  token  is treated as a new request. Do not resubmit the same
          request with the same client token for more than  8  hours,  or  the
          result might not be idempotent.

          If  you  submit a request with the same client token but a change in
          other parameters within  the  8-hour  idempotency  window,  DynamoDB
          returns an IdempotentParameterMismatch exception.

       --s3-bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to export the snapshot to.

       --s3-bucket-owner (string)
          The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket the
          export will be stored in.

       --s3-prefix (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket prefix to use as the file name and path of  the
          exported snapshot.

       --s3-sse-algorithm (string)
          Type  of  encryption  used  on  the bucket where export data will be
          stored. Valid values for S3SseAlgorithm are:

          o AES256 - server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys

          o KMS - server-side encryption with KMS managed keys

          Possible values:

          o AES256

          o KMS

       --s3-sse-kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the KMS managed key used to encrypt the  S3  bucket  where
          export data will be stored (if applicable).

       --export-format (string)
          The  format for the exported data. Valid values for ExportFormat are
          DYNAMODB_JSON or ION .

          Possible values:

          o DYNAMODB_JSON

          o ION

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExportDescription -> (structure)
          Contains a description of the table export.

          ExportArn -> (string)

          ExportStatus -> (string)
              Export can be in one of the following states: IN_PROGRESS,  COM-
              PLETED, or FAILED.

              The time at which the export task began.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the export task completed.

          ExportManifest -> (string)
              The name of the manifest file for the export task.

          TableArn -> (string)

          TableId -> (string)
              Unique ID of the table that was exported.

          ExportTime -> (timestamp)
              Point in time from which table data was exported.

          ClientToken -> (string)
              The client token that was provided for the export task. A client
              token makes calls to  ExportTableToPointInTimeInput  idempotent,
              meaning  that  multiple  identical calls have the same effect as
              one single call.

              containing the export.

          S3Prefix -> (string)
              The  Amazon  S3  bucket prefix used as the file name and path of
              the exported snapshot.

          S3SseAlgorithm -> (string)
              Type of encryption used on  the  bucket  where  export  data  is
              stored. Valid values for S3SseAlgorithm are:

              o AES256 - server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys

              o KMS - server-side encryption with KMS managed keys

          S3SseKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  ID  of  the  KMS  managed key used to encrypt the S3 bucket
              where export data is stored (if applicable).

          FailureCode -> (string)
              Status code for the result of the failed export.

              Export failure reason description.

          ExportFormat -> (string)
              The format of the exported data. Valid values  for  ExportFormat
