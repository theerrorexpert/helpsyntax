OPTIONS
       --global-secondary-index-updates (list)
          Represents the auto scaling settings of the global secondary indexes
          of the replica to be updated.

          (structure)
              Represents the auto scaling settings of a global secondary index
              for a global table that will be modified.

              IndexName -> (string)
                 The name of the global secondary index.

              ProvisionedWriteCapacityAutoScalingUpdate -> (structure)
                 Represents the auto scaling settings to  be  modified  for  a
                 global table or global secondary index.

                 MinimumUnits -> (long)
                     The  minimum capacity units that a global table or global
                     secondary index should be scaled down to.

                 MaximumUnits -> (long)
                     The maximum capacity units that a global table or  global
                     secondary index should be scaled up to.

                 AutoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Disabled  auto  scaling  for  this global table or global
                     secondary index.

                 AutoScalingRoleArn -> (string)
                     Role ARN used for configuring auto scaling policy.

                 ScalingPolicyUpdate -> (structure)
                     The scaling policy to apply for scaling target global ta-
                     ble or global secondary index capacity units.

                     PolicyName -> (string)
                        The name of the scaling policy.

                     TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Represents a target tracking scaling policy configura-
                        tion.

                        DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether scale in by the target  tracking
                            policy is disabled. If the value is true, scale in
                            is disabled and the target tracking  policy  won't
                            remove capacity from the scalable resource. Other-
                            wise, scale in is enabled and the target  tracking
                            policy  can  remove  capacity  from  the  scalable
                            resource. The default value is false.

                        ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, after a  scale  in
                            activity  completes before another scale in activ-
                            ity can start. The  cooldown  period  is  used  to
                            block  subsequent  scale  in requests until it has
                            expired. You should  scale  in  conservatively  to
                            protect  your application's availability. However,
                            if another alarm triggers a scale out policy  dur-
                            ing the cooldown period after a scale-in, applica-
                            tion auto scaling scales out your scalable  target
                            immediately.

                        ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                            The  amount of time, in seconds, after a scale out
                            activity completes before another scale out activ-
                            ity  can  start.  While  the cooldown period is in
                            effect, the capacity that has been  added  by  the
                            previous   scale  out  event  that  initiated  the
                            cooldown is calculated  as  part  of  the  desired
                            capacity  for  the next scale out. You should con-
                            tinuously (but not excessively) scale out.

                        TargetValue -> (double)
                            The target value for  the  metric.  The  range  is
                            8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360
                            to 2e360 (Base 2).

                     Indicates  whether scale in by the target tracking policy
                     is disabled. If the value is true, scale in  is  disabled
                     and the target tracking policy won't remove capacity from
                     the scalable resource. Otherwise, scale in is enabled and
                     the  target  tracking policy can remove capacity from the
                     scalable resource. The default value is false.

                 ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale in activity
                     completes before another scale in activity can start. The
                     cooldown period is used  to  block  subsequent  scale  in
                     requests  until  it has expired. You should scale in con-
                     servatively to protect your  application's  availability.
                     However,  if  another  alarm  triggers a scale out policy
                     during the cooldown period after a scale-in,  application
                     auto scaling scales out your scalable target immediately.

                 ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale out  activ-
                     ity  completes  before  another  scale  out  activity can
                     start. While the cooldown period is in effect, the capac-
                     ity  that  has been added by the previous scale out event
                     that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of  the
                     desired  capacity for the next scale out. You should con-
                     tinuously (but not excessively) scale out.

                 TargetValue -> (double)
                     The  target  value  for  the   metric.   The   range   is
                     8.515920e-109  to  1.174271e+108  (Base  10) or 2e-360 to

                        Represents a target tracking scaling policy configura-
                        tion.

                        DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether scale in by the target tracking
                            policy is disabled. If the value is true, scale in
                            is  disabled  and the target tracking policy won't
                            remove capacity from the scalable resource. Other-
                            wise,  scale in is enabled and the target tracking
                            policy  can  remove  capacity  from  the  scalable
                            resource. The default value is false.

                        ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of time, in seconds, after a scale in
                            activity completes before another scale in  activ-
                            ity  can  start.  The  cooldown  period is used to
                            block subsequent scale in requests  until  it  has
                            expired.  You  should  scale  in conservatively to
                            protect your application's availability.  However,
                            if  another alarm triggers a scale out policy dur-
                            ing the cooldown period after a scale-in, applica-
                            tion  auto scaling scales out your scalable target
                            immediately.

                        ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale  out
                            activity completes before another scale out activ-
                            ity can start. While the  cooldown  period  is  in
                            effect,  the  capacity  that has been added by the
                            previous  scale  out  event  that  initiated   the
                            cooldown  is  calculated  as  part  of the desired
                            capacity for the next scale out. You  should  con-
                            tinuously (but not excessively) scale out.

                        TargetValue -> (double)
                            The  target  value  for  the  metric. The range is
                            8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360
                            to 2e360 (Base 2).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                                   period is used to block subsequent scale in
                                   requests until it has expired.  You  should
                                   scale  in  conservatively  to  protect your
                                   application's  availability.  However,   if
                                   another  alarm  triggers a scale out policy
                                   during  the   cooldown   period   after   a
                                   scale-in,  application  auto scaling scales
                                   out your scalable target immediately.

                                   The amount of time,  in  seconds,  after  a
                                   scale out activity completes before another
                                   scale out activity  can  start.  While  the
                                   cooldown  period is in effect, the capacity
                                   that has been added by the  previous  scale
                                   out  event  that  initiated the cooldown is
                                   calculated as part of the desired  capacity
                                   for the next scale out. You should continu-
                                   ously (but not excessively) scale out.

                                   The target value for the metric. The  range
                                   is 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10)
                                   or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

                 ReplicaProvisionedWriteCapacityAutoScalingSettings -> (struc-
                 ture)
                     Represents  the  auto scaling settings for a global table
                     or global secondary index.

                     MinimumUnits -> (long)
                        The minimum capacity units  that  a  global  table  or
                        global secondary index should be scaled down to.

                     MaximumUnits -> (long)
                        The  maximum  capacity  units  that  a global table or
                        global secondary index should be scaled up to.

                     AutoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                        Disabled auto scaling for this global table or  global
                        secondary index.

                     AutoScalingRoleArn -> (string)
                        Role ARN used for configuring the auto scaling policy.

                     ScalingPolicies -> (list)
                        Information about the scaling policies.

                        (structure)
                            Represents the properties of the scaling policy.

                            PolicyName -> (string)
                               The name of the scaling policy.

                            (structure)
                               Represents  a  target  tracking  scaling policy
                               configuration.

                               DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                                   Indicates whether scale in  by  the  target
                                   tracking  policy  is disabled. If the value
                                   is true, scale in is disabled and the  tar-
                                   get  tracking  policy won't remove capacity
                                   from  the  scalable  resource.   Otherwise,
                                   scale in is enabled and the target tracking
                                   policy can remove capacity from  the  scal-
                                   able  resource. The default value is false.
