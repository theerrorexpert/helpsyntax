BATCH-DELETE-DOCUMENT()                                BATCH-DELETE-DOCUMENT()



NAME
       batch-delete-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  one  or  more documents from an index. The documents must have
       been added with the BatchPutDocument operation.

       The documents are deleted asynchronously. You can see the  progress  of
       the  deletion  by  using Amazon Web Services CloudWatch. Any error mes-
       sages related to the processing of the batch are sent to you CloudWatch
       log.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-document
          --index-id <value>
          --document-id-list <value>
          [--data-source-sync-job-metric-target <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that contains the documents to delete.

       --document-id-list (list)
          One or more identifiers for documents to delete from the index.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --data-source-sync-job-metric-target (structure)
          Maps  a particular data source sync job to a particular data source.

          DataSourceId -> (string)
              The ID of the data source that is running the sync job.

          DataSourceSyncJobId -> (string)
              The ID of the sync job that is running on the data source.

              If the ID of a sync job is not provided and there is a sync  job
              running,  then  the  ID of this sync job is used and metrics are
              generated for this sync job.

              If the ID of a sync job is not provided and there is no sync job
              running,  then  no  metrics  are  generated  and  documents  are
              indexed/deleted at the index  level  without  sync  job  metrics
              included.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DataSourceId=string,DataSourceSyncJobId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DataSourceId": "string",
            "DataSourceSyncJobId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedDocuments -> (list)
          A  list  of documents that could not be removed from the index. Each
          entry contains an error message  that  indicates  why  the  document
          couldn't be removed from the index.

          (structure)
              Provides  information  about documents that could not be removed
              from an index by the BatchDeleteDocument operation.

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the document that couldn't be removed  from
                 the index.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  error code for why the document couldn't be removed from
                 the index.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 An explanation for why the document couldn't be removed  from
                 the index.
