NAME
       describe-data-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a Amazon Kendra data source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-data-source
          --id <value>
          --index-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier of the data source to describe.

       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that contains the data source.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The identifier of the data source.

       IndexId -> (string)
          The identifier of the index that contains the data source.

       Configuration -> (structure)
          Information  that describes where the data source is located and how
          the data source is  configured.  The  specific  information  in  the
          description depends on the data source provider.

          S3Configuration -> (structure)
              Provides  information  to  create  a data source connector for a
              document repository in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket that contains the documents.

              InclusionPrefixes -> (list)
                 A list of S3  prefixes  for  the  documents  that  should  be
                 included in the index.

                 (string)

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of glob patterns for documents that should be indexed.
                 If a document that matches an inclusion pattern also  matches
                 an exclusion pattern, the document is not indexed.

                 Some examples are:

                 o
                   **
                   .txt*  will  include  all  text files in a directory (files
                   with the extension .txt).

                   **
                   /.txt* will include all text files in a directory  and  its
                   subdirectories.

                 o tax  will  include  all  files  in a directory that contain
                   'tax'  in  the  file  name,   such   as   'tax',   'taxes',

                 A  list  of  glob  patterns  for documents that should not be
                 indexed. If a document that matches an  inclusion  prefix  or
                 inclusion pattern also matches an exclusion pattern, the doc-
                 ument is not indexed.

                 Some examples are:

                 o
                   **
                   .png , .jpg will exclude all PNG and JPEG image files in  a
                   directory (files with the extensions .png and .jpg).

                   'internal' in the file name, such  as  'internal',  'inter-
                   nal_only', 'company_internal'.

                 o */*internal  will  exclude  all internal-related files in a
                   directory and its subdirectories.

                 (string)

              DocumentsMetadataConfiguration -> (structure)

                 document  access  control  information,  source URI, document
                 author, and custom attributes. Each  metadata  file  contains
                 metadata about a single document.

                 S3Prefix -> (string)
                     A  prefix  used to filter metadata configuration files in
                     the Amazon Web Services S3 bucket. The  S3  bucket  might
                     contain  multiple metadata files. Use S3Prefix to include
                     only the desired metadata files.

              AccessControlListConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Provides the path to the S3 bucket  that  contains  the  user
                 context  filtering  files for the data source. For the format
                 of the file, see Access control for S3 data sources .

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  credentials  stored  in
                 Secrets  Manager.  The  credentials should be a user/password
                 pair. If you use SharePoint Server, you also need to  provide
                 the  sever  domain  name as part of the credentials. For more
                 information, see Using a Microsoft SharePoint Data  Source  .
                 For  more  information  about  Secrets  Manager  see  What Is
                 Secrets Manager in the Secrets Manager user guide.

              CrawlAttachments -> (boolean)
                 TRUE to include  attachments  to  documents  stored  in  your

                 Set  to  TRUE  to  use the Microsoft SharePoint change log to
                 determine the documents that need to be updated in the index.
                 Depending  on  the  size of the SharePoint change log, it may
                 take longer for Amazon Kendra to use the change log  than  it
                 takes  it to determine the changed documents using the Amazon
                 Kendra document crawler.

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of regular expression patterns. Documents  that  match
                 the  patterns are included in the index. Documents that don't
                 match the patterns are excluded from the index. If a document
                 matches  both  an inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern,
                 the document is not included in the index.

                 The regex is applied to the display  URL  of  the  SharePoint
                 document.

                 (string)

              ExclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A  list  of regular expression patterns. Documents that match
                 the patterns are excluded  from  the  index.  Documents  that
                 don't match the patterns are included in the index. If a doc-
                 ument matches both an exclusion pattern and an inclusion pat-
                 tern, the document is not included in the index.

                 The  regex  is  applied  to the display URL of the SharePoint
                 document.

                     specified  in  the  UserContext field of the Query opera-
                     tion.

              SqlConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Provides information about how Amazon Kendra uses quote marks
                 around  SQL identifiers when querying a database data source.

                 QueryIdentifiersEnclosingOption -> (string)
                     Determines whether Amazon Kendra encloses SQL identifiers
                     for  tables  and  column  names in double quotes (") when
                     making a database query.

                     By default, Amazon Kendra passes SQL identifiers the  way
                     that they are entered into the data source configuration.
                     It does not change the case  of  identifiers  or  enclose
                     them in quotes.

                     PostgreSQL  internally  converts  uppercase characters to
                     lower case characters  in  identifiers  unless  they  are
                     quoted.  Choosing  this  option  encloses  identifiers in
                     quotes so that PostgreSQL does not  convert  the  charac-
                     ter's case.

                     For  MySQL  databases,  you  must  enable the ansi_quotes
                     option when you set this field to DOUBLE_QUOTES .

          SalesforceConfiguration -> (structure)
              Provides configuration information for data sources that connect
              to a Salesforce site.

                 The  instance  URL  for  the Salesforce site that you want to
                 index.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  an  Secrets  Managersecret
                 that contains the key/value pairs required to connect to your
                 Salesforce instance. The secret must contain a JSON structure
                 with the following keys:

                 o authenticationUrl  -  The OAUTH endpoint that Amazon Kendra

                     aren't indexed. A space in the list  must  exist.  Other-
                     wise, Amazon Kendra logs an error when the data source is
                     synchronized. If a space is in both the IncludeSpaces and
                     the ExcludeSpaces list, the space is excluded.

                 ID.  You  can  also set up a new Amazon WorkDocs directory in
                 the Directory Service console and enable  a  Amazon  WorkDocs
                 site for the directory in the Amazon WorkDocs console.

              CrawlComments -> (boolean)
                     TRUE  to  include  comments  on  documents in your index.
                     Including comments in your index means each comment is  a
                     document that can be searched on.

                 The default is set to FALSE .

              UseChangeLog -> (boolean)
                     TRUE  to  use the change logs to update documents in your
                     index instead of scanning all documents.

                 If you are syncing your Amazon WorkDocs data source with your
                 index  for  the  first time, all documents are scanned. After
                 your first sync, you can use the change logs to  update  your
                 documents in your index for future syncs.

                 The default is set to FALSE .

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A  list  of  regular  expression  patterns to include certain
                 files in your Amazon WorkDocs  site  repository.  Files  that
                 match  the  patterns  are  included  in the index. Files that
                 don't match the patterns are excluded from the  index.  If  a
                 file  matches both an inclusion pattern and an exclusion pat-
                 tern, the exclusion pattern takes  precedence  and  the  file
                 isnt included in the index.

                 (string)

              ExclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A  list  of  regular  expression  patterns to exclude certain
                 files in your Amazon WorkDocs  site  repository.  Files  that
                 match  the  patterns  are excluded from the index. Files that
                 dont match the patterns are included in the index. If a  file
                 matches  both  an inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern,
                 the exclusion pattern takes  precedence  and  the  file  isnt
                 included in the index.

                     into Amazon Kendra.

                     ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                        The  identifier of the document attribute used for the
                        condition.

                        For example, 'Source_URI' could be an  identifier  for
                        the  attribute  or metadata field that contains source
                        URIs associated with the documents.

                        Amazon  Kendra  currently  does  not  support   _docu-
                        ment_body  as an attribute key used for the condition.

                     Operator -> (string)
                        The condition operator.

                        For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match
                        a string.

                     ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                        The value used by the operator.

                        For example, you can specify the value 'financial' for
                        strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match
                        or contain this value.

                        StringValue -> (string)

                        metadata field.

                        For example, 'Department' could be an  identifier  for
                        the  target  attribute or metadata field that includes
                        the department names associated with the documents.

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValueDeletion -> (boolean)
                        TRUE to delete the  existing  target  value  for  your
                        specified  target  attribute  key. You cannot create a
                        target value and set this to TRUE . To create a target
                        value  (TargetDocumentAttributeValue  ),  set  this to
                        FALSE .
