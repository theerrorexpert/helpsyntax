          --index-id <value>
          --query-id <value>
          [--click-feedback-items <value>]
          [--relevance-feedback-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that was queried.

       --query-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the specific query for which you are submitting
          feedback. The query ID is returned in  the  response  to  the  Query
          operation.

       --click-feedback-items (list)
          Tells  Amazon Kendra that a particular search result link was chosen
          by the user.

          (structure)
              Gathers information about when a particular result  was  clicked
              by a user. Your application uses the SubmitFeedback operation to
              provide click information.

              ResultId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the search result that was  clicked.

              ClickTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix  timestamp of the date and time that the result was
                 clicked.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResultId=string,ClickTime=timestamp ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResultId": "string",
              "ClickTime": timestamp
            }
            ...
          ]

       --relevance-feedback-items (list)
          Provides Amazon Kendra with relevant or not  relevant  feedback  for
          whether a particular item was relevant to the search.

          (structure)
              Provides  feedback  on  how  relevant a document is to a search.
              Your application uses the SubmitFeedback  operation  to  provide
              relevance information.

              ResultId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the search result that the user pro-
                 vided relevance feedback for.

              RelevanceValue -> (string)
                 Whether to document was  relevant  or  not  relevant  to  the
                 search.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResultId=string,RelevanceValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResultId": "string",
              "RelevanceValue": "RELEVANT"|"NOT_RELEVANT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
