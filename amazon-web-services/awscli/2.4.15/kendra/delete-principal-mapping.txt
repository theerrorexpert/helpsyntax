DELETE-PRINCIPAL-MAPPING()                          DELETE-PRINCIPAL-MAPPING()



NAME
       delete-principal-mapping -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  group  so  that all users and sub groups that belong to the
       group can no longer access documents only available to that group.

       For example, after deleting the group "Summer Interns", all interns who
       belonged  to  that  group  no longer see intern-only documents in their
       search results.

       If you want to delete or replace users or sub groups of  a  group,  you
       need  to  use the PutPrincipalMapping operation. For example, if a user
       in the group "Engineering" leaves the engineering team and another user
       takes  their  place, you provide an updated list of users or sub groups
       that belong to the "Engineering" group when calling PutPrincipalMapping
       .  You  can  update your internal list of users or sub groups and input
       this list when calling PutPrincipalMapping .
          DeletePrincipalMapping is currently not supported in the Amazon  Web
          Services GovCloud (US-West) region.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-principal-mapping
          --index-id <value>
          [--data-source-id <value>]
          --group-id <value>
          [--ordering-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to delete a group from.

       --data-source-id (string)
          The identifier of the data source you want to delete a group from.

          This  is  useful if a group is tied to multiple data sources and you
          want to delete a group from accessing documents in  a  certain  data
          source.  For  example,  the  groups  "Research",  "Engineering", and
          "Sales and Marketing" are all tied to the company's documents stored
          in  the  data  sources Confluence and Salesforce. You want to delete
          "Research" and "Engineering" groups from Salesforce, so  that  these
          groups  cannot  access  customer-related  documents stored in Sales-
          force. Only "Sales and Marketing" should  access  documents  in  the
          Salesforce data source.

       --group-id (string)
          The identifier of the group you want to delete.

       --ordering-id (long)
          The  timestamp  identifier  you specify to ensure Amazon Kendra does
          not override the latest DELETE action  with  previous  actions.  The
          highest  number  ID,  which is the ordering ID, is the latest action
          you want to process and apply on top of  other  actions  with  lower
          number  IDs.  This  prevents  previous actions with lower number IDs
          from possibly overriding the latest action.

          The ordering ID can be the UNIX time of the last update you made  to
          a  group members list. You would then provide this list when calling
          PutPrincipalMapping . This  ensures  your  DELETE  action  for  that
          updated  group  with the latest members list doesn't get overwritten
          by earlier DELETE actions for the same group which  are  yet  to  be
          processed.

          The  default  ordering  ID  is the current UNIX time in milliseconds
          that the action was received by Amazon Kendra.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
