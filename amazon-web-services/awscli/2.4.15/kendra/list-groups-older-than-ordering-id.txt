SYNOPSIS
            list-groups-older-than-ordering-id
          --index-id <value>
          [--data-source-id <value>]
          --ordering-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the index for getting a list of groups mapped to
          users before a given ordering or timestamp identifier.

       --data-source-id (string)
          The identifier of the data source  for  getting  a  list  of  groups
          mapped to users before a given ordering timestamp identifier.

       --ordering-id (long)
          The  timestamp  identifier  used for the latest PUT or DELETE action
          for mapping users to their groups.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  data
          to  retrieve),  Amazon  Kendra  returns  a  pagination  token in the
          response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set
          of  groups that are mapped to users before a given ordering or time-
          stamp identifier.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of returned  groups  that  are  mapped  to  users
          before a given ordering or timestamp identifier.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GroupsSummaries -> (list)
          Summary  information  for  list  of  groups that are mapped to users
          before a given ordering or timestamp identifier.

          (structure)
              Group summary information.

              GroupId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the group you want group  summary  informa-
                 tion on.

              OrderingId -> (long)
                 The  timestamp  identifier  used for the latest PUT or DELETE
                 action.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Kendra returns this token  that
          you  can  use  in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of
          groups that are mapped to users before a given ordering or timestamp
          identifier.
