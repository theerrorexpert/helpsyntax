BATCH-PUT-DOCUMENT()                                      BATCH-PUT-DOCUMENT()



NAME
       batch-put-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds one or more documents to an index.

       The  BatchPutDocument  operation enables you to ingest inline documents
       or a set of documents stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use this operation
       to  ingest  your  text  and unstructured text into an index, add custom
       attributes to the documents, and to attach an access  control  list  to
       the documents added to the index.

       The  documents  are indexed asynchronously. You can see the progress of
       the batch using Amazon Web  Services  CloudWatch.  Any  error  messages
       related  to  processing  the batch are sent to your Amazon Web Services
       CloudWatch log.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-put-document
          --index-id <value>
          [--role-arn <value>]
          --documents <value>
          [--custom-document-enrichment-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index to add the documents  to.  You  need  to
          create the index first using the CreateIndex operation.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role that is allowed to run the
          BatchPutDocument operation. For more information, see IAM Roles  for
          Amazon Kendra .

       --documents (list)
          One or more documents to add to the index.

          Documents can include custom attributes. For example, 'DataSourceId'
          and 'DataSourceSyncJobId' are custom attributes that provide  infor-
          mation on the synchronization of documents running on a data source.
          Note, 'DataSourceSyncJobId' could be an optional custom attribute as
          Amazon Kendra will use the ID of a running sync job.

          Documents have the following file size limits.

          o 5 MB total size for inline documents

          o 50 MB total size for files from an S3 bucket

          o 5 MB extracted text for any file

          For more information about file size and transaction per second quo-
          tas, see Quotas .

          (structure)
              A document in an index.

              Id -> (string)
                 A unique identifier of the document in the index.

              Title -> (string)
                 The title of the document.

              Blob -> (blob)
                 The contents of the document.

                 Documents  passed  to  the  Blob  parameter  must  be  base64
                 encoded. Your code might not need to encode the document file
                 bytes if you're using an Amazon Web Services SDK to call Ama-
                 zon  Kendra  operations. If you are calling the Amazon Kendra
                 endpoint directly using REST, you must base64 encode the con-
                 tents before sending.

              S3Path -> (structure)
                 Information  required to find a specific file in an Amazon S3
                 bucket.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket that contains the file.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the file.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 Custom attributes to apply to the document.  Use  the  custom
                 attributes  to  provide additional information for searching,
                 to provide facets for refining searches, and to provide addi-
                 tional information in the query response.

                 (structure)
                     A custom attribute value assigned to a document.

                     For  more  information  on  how to create custom document
                     attributes, see Custom Attributes .

          Configuration  information  for  altering your document metadata and
          content during the document  ingestion  process  when  you  use  the
          BatchPutDocument operation.

          For  more  information  on how to create, modify and delete document
          metadata, or make other content alterations when  you  ingest  docu-
          ments  into  Amazon Kendra, see Customizing document metadata during
          the ingestion process .

          InlineConfigurations -> (list)
              Configuration information to alter document attributes or  meta-
              data  fields  and  content  when ingesting documents into Amazon
              Kendra.

              (structure)
                 Provides the configuration  information  for  applying  basic
                 logic  to  alter document metadata and content when ingesting
                 documents into Amazon Kendra. To apply advanced logic, to  go
                 beyond    what   you   can   do   with   basic   logic,   see
                 HookConfiguration .

                 For more information, see Customizing document metadata  dur-
                 ing the ingestion process .

                 Condition -> (structure)
                     Configuration  of the condition used for the target docu-
                     ment attribute or metadata field when ingesting documents
                     into Amazon Kendra.

                     ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                        The  identifier of the document attribute used for the
                        condition.

                        For example, 'Source_URI' could be an  identifier  for
                        the  attribute  or metadata field that contains source
                        URIs associated with the documents.

                        Amazon  Kendra  currently  does  not  support   _docu-
                        ment_body  as an attribute key used for the condition.

                     Operator -> (string)
                        The condition operator.

                        For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match
                        a string.

                     ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                        The value used by the operator.

                        For example, you can specify the value 'financial' for
                        strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match
                        or contain this value.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                        LongValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        DateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It  is  important for the time zone to be included
                            in the ISO 8601  date-time  format.  For  example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00    is   the   ISO   8601
                            date-time format for March 25th  2012  at  12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                 Target -> (structure)
                     Configuration  of  the target document attribute or meta-
                     data field when ingesting documents into  Amazon  Kendra.
                     You can also include a value.

                     TargetDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                        The  identifier  of  the  target document attribute or
                        metadata field.

                        For example, 'Department' could be an  identifier  for
                        the  target  attribute or metadata field that includes
                        the department names associated with the documents.

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValueDeletion -> (boolean)
                        TRUE to delete the  existing  target  value  for  your
                        specified  target  attribute  key. You cannot create a
                        target value and set this to TRUE . To create a target
                        value  (TargetDocumentAttributeValue  ),  set  this to
                        FALSE .

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValue -> (structure)
                        The target value you want to  create  for  the  target
                        attribute.

                        For  example,  'Finance' could be the target value for
                        the target attribute key 'Department'.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It is important for the time zone to  be  included
                            in  the  ISO  8601  date-time format. For example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the   ISO    8601
                            date-time  format  for  March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                 DocumentContentDeletion -> (boolean)
                     TRUE to delete content if the condition used for the tar-
                     get attribute is met.

          PreExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration  information  for  invoking  a  Lambda function in
              Lambda on the original or raw documents before extracting  their
              metadata  and  text.  You  can  use  a  Lambda function to apply
              advanced logic for creating,  modifying,  or  deleting  document
              metadata  and  content.  For more information, see Advanced data
              manipulation .

              InvocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The condition used for  when  a  Lambda  function  should  be
                 invoked.

                 For  example,  you  can specify a condition that if there are
                 empty date-time values, then Amazon Kendra  should  invoke  a
                 function that inserts the current date-time.

                 ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                     The  identifier  of  the  document attribute used for the
                     condition.

                     For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for  the
                     attribute  or  metadata  field  that contains source URIs
                     associated with the documents.

                     Amazon Kendra currently does not  support  _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     The condition operator.

                     For  example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match a
                     string.

                 ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                     The value used by the operator.

                     For example, you can specify the  value  'financial'  for
                     strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match or
                     contain this value.

                     StringValue -> (string)
                        A string, such as "department".

                     StringListValue -> (list)
                        A list of strings.

                        (string)

                     LongValue -> (long)
                        A long integer value.

                     DateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It is important for the time zone to  be  included  in
                        the   ISO   8601   date-time   format.   For  example,
                        2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is the  ISO  8601  date-time
                        format  for  March  25th 2012 at 12:30PM (plus 10 sec-
                        onds) in Central European Time.

              LambdaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with  permission  to
                 run a Lambda function during ingestion. For more information,
                 see IAM roles for Amazon Kendra .

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 Stores the original, raw documents or the structured,  parsed
                 documents  before  and after altering them. For more informa-
                 tion, see Data contracts for Lambda functions .

          PostExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration information for  invoking  a  Lambda  function  in
              Lambda  on the structured documents with their metadata and text
              extracted. You can use a Lambda function to apply advanced logic
              for  creating, modifying, or deleting document metadata and con-
              tent. For more information, see Advanced data manipulation .

              InvocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The condition used for  when  a  Lambda  function  should  be
                 invoked.

                 For  example,  you  can specify a condition that if there are
                 empty date-time values, then Amazon Kendra  should  invoke  a
                 function that inserts the current date-time.

                 ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                     The  identifier  of  the  document attribute used for the
                     condition.

                     For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for  the
                     attribute  or  metadata  field  that contains source URIs
                     associated with the documents.

                     Amazon Kendra currently does not  support  _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     The condition operator.

                     For  example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match a
                     string.

                 ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                     The value used by the operator.

                     For example, you can specify the  value  'financial'  for
                     strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match or
                     contain this value.

                     StringValue -> (string)
                        A string, such as "department".

                     StringListValue -> (list)
                        A list of strings.

                        (string)

                     LongValue -> (long)
                        A long integer value.

                     DateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It is important for the time zone to  be  included  in
                        the   ISO   8601   date-time   format.   For  example,
                        2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is the  ISO  8601  date-time
                        format  for  March  25th 2012 at 12:30PM (plus 10 sec-
                        onds) in Central European Time.

              LambdaArn -> (string)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedDocuments -> (list)
          A list of documents that were not added to  the  index  because  the

          index.

          If  there  was  an  error adding a document to an index the error is
          reported in your Amazon Web Services CloudWatch log. For more infor-
          mation, see Monitoring Amazon Kendra with Amazon CloudWatch Logs
