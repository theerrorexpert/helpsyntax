BATCH-GET-DOCUMENT-STATUS()                        BATCH-GET-DOCUMENT-STATUS()



NAME
       batch-get-document-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  indexing  status for one or more documents submitted with
       the BatchPutDocument operation.

       When you use the  BatchPutDocument  operation,  documents  are  indexed
       asynchronously. You can use the BatchGetDocumentStatus operation to get
       the current status of a list of documents so that you can determine  if
       they have been successfully indexed.

       You can also use the BatchGetDocumentStatus operation to check the sta-
       tus of the BatchDeleteDocument operation. When a  document  is  deleted
       from the index, Amazon Kendra returns NOT_FOUND as the status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-document-status
          --index-id <value>
          --document-info-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  index to add documents to. The index ID is
          returned by the CreateIndex operation.

       --document-info-list (list)
          A list of DocumentInfo objects that identify the documents for which
          to  get  the status. You identify the documents by their document ID
          and optional attributes.

          (structure)
              Identifies a document for which to retrieve status information

              DocumentId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the document.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 Attributes that identify a specific version of a document  to
                 check.

                 The only valid attributes are:

                 o version

                 o datasourceId

                 o jobExecutionId

                 The attributes follow these rules:

                 o dataSourceId and jobExecutionId must be used together.

                 o version  is  ignored if dataSourceId and jobExecutionId are
                   not provided.

                 o If dataSourceId and jobExecutionId are provided,  but  ver-
                   sion is not, the version defaults to "0".

                 (structure)
                     A custom attribute value assigned to a document.

                     For  more  information  on  how to create custom document
                     attributes, see Custom Attributes .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The identifier for the attribute.

                     Value -> (structure)
                        The value of the attribute.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                        LongValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        DateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It is important for the time zone to  be  included
                            in  the  ISO  8601  date-time format. For example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the   ISO    8601
                            date-time  format  for  March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DocumentId": "string",
              "Attributes": [
                {
                  "Key": "string",
                  "Value": {
                    "StringValue": "string",
                    "StringListValue": ["string", ...],
                    "LongValue": long,
                    "DateValue": timestamp
                  }
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Errors -> (list)
          A list of documents that Amazon Kendra couldn't get the status  for.
          The  list  includes  the  ID of the document and the reason that the
          status couldn't be found.

          (structure)
              Provides a response when the status of a document could  not  be
              retrieved.

              DocumentId -> (string)
                 The  unique identifier of the document whose status could not
                 be retrieved.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 Indicates the source of the error.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 States that the API could not get the status of  a  document.
                 This  could be because the request is not valid or there is a
                 system error.

       DocumentStatusList -> (list)
          The status of documents. The status indicates  if  the  document  is
          waiting  to be indexed, is in the process of indexing, has completed
          indexing, or failed indexing. If a  document  failed  indexing,  the
          status provides the reason why.

          (structure)
              Provides information about the status of documents submitted for
              indexing.

              DocumentId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the document.

              DocumentStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of a document.

                 If the document was submitted for  deletion,  the  status  is
                 NOT_FOUND after the document is deleted.

              FailureCode -> (string)
                 Indicates the source of the error.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 Provides detailed information about why the document couldn't
                 be indexed. Use this information to correct the error  before
                 you resubmit the document for indexing.
