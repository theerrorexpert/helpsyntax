NAME
       describe-principal-mapping -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the processing of PUT and DELETE actions for mapping users to
       their groups. This includes information on the status of  actions  cur-
       rently  processing  or  yet  to  be  processed,  when actions were last
       updated, when actions were received by Amazon Kendra, the latest action
       that  should  process  and  apply after other actions, and useful error
       messages if an action could not be processed.
          DescribePrincipalMapping is currently not supported  in  the  Amazon
          Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-principal-mapping
          --index-id <value>
          [--data-source-id <value>]
          --group-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The  identifier of the index required to check the processing of PUT
          and DELETE actions for mapping users to their groups.

       --data-source-id (string)
          The identifier of the data source to check the processing of PUT and
          DELETE actions for mapping users to their groups.

       --group-id (string)
          The  identifier of the group required to check the processing of PUT
          and DELETE actions for mapping users to their groups.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          actions for mapping users to their groups:

          o Status  the status can be either PROCESSING , SUCCEEDED , DELETING
            , DELETED , or FAILED .

          o Last updated  the last date-time an action was updated.

          o Received  the last date-time an action was received or  submitted.

          o Ordering ID  the latest action that should process and apply after
