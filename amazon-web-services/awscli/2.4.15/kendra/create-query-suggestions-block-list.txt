DESCRIPTION
       Creates a block list to exlcude certain queries from suggestions.

       blocked or filtered out from being shown as a suggestion.

       You need to provide the file location of your block list text  file  in
       your S3 bucket. In your text file, enter each block word or phrase on a
       separate line.

       For information on the current quota limits for block lists, see Quotas

          [--description <value>]
          --source-s3-path <value>
          [--client-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to create a  query  suggestions
          block list for.

       --name (string)
          A user friendly name for the block list.

          For  example,  the  block  list named 'offensive-words' includes all
          offensive words that could appear in user queries  and  need  to  be
          blocked from suggestions.

       --description (string)
          A user-friendly description for the block list.

          For  example,  the description "List of all offensive words that can
          appear in user queries and need to be blocked from suggestions."

       --source-s3-path (structure)
          The S3 path to your block list text file in your S3 bucket.

          Each block word or phrase should be on a separate  line  in  a  text
          file.

          For  information  on  the  current quota limits for block lists, see
          Quotas for Amazon Kendra .

          Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the S3 bucket that contains the file.

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Key=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Key": "string"
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A token that you provide to identify the request to create  a  query
          suggestions block list.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  IAM (Identity and Access Management) role used by Amazon Kendra
          to access the block list text file in your S3 bucket.

          You need permissions to the role ARN  (Amazon  Resource  Name).  The
          role  needs S3 read permissions to your file in S3 and needs to give
          STS (Security Token  Service)  assume  role  permissions  to  Amazon
          Kendra.

       --tags (list)
          A tag that you can assign to a block list that categorizes the block
          list.

          (structure)
              A list of key/value pairs that identify an index, FAQ,  or  data
              source. Tag keys and values can consist of Unicode letters, dig-
              its, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =  +
              - @.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key for the tag. Keys are not case sensitive and must be
                 unique for the index, FAQ, or data source.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value associated with the tag. The value may be an  empty
                 string but it can't be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the created block list.
