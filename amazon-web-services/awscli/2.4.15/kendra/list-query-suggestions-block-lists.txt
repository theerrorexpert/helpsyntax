       For information on the current quota limits for block lists, see Quotas
       for Amazon Kendra .
          ListQuerySuggestionsBlockLists is currently  not  supported  in  the
          Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-query-suggestions-block-lists
          --index-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index for a list of all block lists that exist
          for that index.

          For information on the current quota limits  for  block  lists,  see
          Quotas for Amazon Kendra .

       --next-token (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon  Kendra  returns  a  pagination  token  in  the
          response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set
          of block lists (BlockListSummaryItems ).

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of block lists to return.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BlockListSummaryItems -> (list)
          Summary items for a block list.

          This includes summary items on the block list ID, block  list  name,
          when  the  block  list  was  created,  when  the block list was last
          updated, and the count of block words/phrases in the block list.

              when the block list was created, when the block  list  was  last
              updated, and the count of block words/phrases in the block list.
