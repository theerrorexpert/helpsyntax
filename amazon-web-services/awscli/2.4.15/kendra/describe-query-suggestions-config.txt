NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the settings of query suggestions for an index.

       This  is  used  to  check the current settings applied to query sugges-
       tions.
          DescribeQuerySuggestionsConfig is currently  not  supported  in  the
          Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-query-suggestions-config
          --index-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the index you want to describe query suggestions
          settings for.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Mode -> (string)
          Shows whether query suggestions are currently  in  ENABLED  mode  or
          LEARN_ONLY mode.

          By  default,  Amazon Kendra enables query suggestions.``LEARN_ONLY``
          turns off query suggestions for your users. You can change the  mode
          using the UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig operation.

       Status -> (string)
          Shows  whether the status of query suggestions settings is currently
          Active or Updating.

          Active means the current settings  apply  and  Updating  means  your
          changed settings are in the process of applying.

       QueryLogLookBackWindowInDays -> (integer)
          Shows  how recent your queries are in your query log time window (in
          days).

       IncludeQueriesWithoutUserInformation -> (boolean)
          Shows whether Amazon Kendra uses all queries or  only  uses  queries
          that include user information to generate query suggestions.

       MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers -> (integer)
          Shows  the minimum number of unique users who must search a query in
          order for the query to be eligible to suggest to your users.

       MinimumQueryCount -> (integer)
          Shows the minimum number of times a query must be searched in  order
          for the query to be eligible to suggest to your users.

       LastSuggestionsBuildTime -> (timestamp)
          Shows the date-time query suggestions for an index was last updated.

       LastClearTime -> (timestamp)
          Shows the date-time query suggestions for an index was last cleared.

          After  you  clear  suggestions, Amazon Kendra learns new suggestions
          based on new queries added to  the  query  log  from  the  time  you
          cleared suggestions. Amazon Kendra only considers re-occurences of a
          query from the time you cleared suggestions.

       TotalSuggestionsCount -> (integer)
          Shows the current total count of query suggestions for an index.

          This count can change when you update your  query  suggestions  set-
          tings,  if  you  filter out certain queries from suggestions using a
          block list, and as the query log accumulates more queries for Amazon
          Kendra to learn from.
