NAME
       update-query-suggestions-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the settings of query suggestions for an index.

       Amazon Kendra supports partial updates, so you only need to provide the
       fields you want to update.

       If an update is currently processing (i.e. 'happening'),  you  need  to
       wait for the update to finish before making another update.

       Updates to query suggestions settings might not take effect right away.
       The time for your updated  settings  to  take  effect  depends  on  the
       updates made and the number of search queries in your index.

       You can still enable/disable query suggestions at any time.
          UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig  is currently not supported in the Ama-
          zon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-query-suggestions-config
          --index-id <value>
          [--mode <value>]
          [--query-log-look-back-window-in-days <value>]
          [--include-queries-without-user-information | --no-include-queries-without-user-information]
          [--minimum-number-of-querying-users <value>]
          [--minimum-query-count <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want  to  update  query  suggestions
          settings for.

       --mode (string)
          Set the mode to ENABLED or LEARN_ONLY .

          By default, Amazon Kendra enables query suggestions. LEARN_ONLY mode
          allows you to turn off query suggestions. You can to update this  at
          any time.

          In  LEARN_ONLY  mode,  Amazon  Kendra  continues  to  learn from new
          queries to keep suggestions up to date for when  you  are  ready  to
          switch to ENABLED mode again.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o LEARN_ONLY

       --query-log-look-back-window-in-days (integer)
          How recent your queries are in your query log time window.

          The time window is the number of days from current day to past days.

          By default, Amazon Kendra sets this to 180.

       --include-queries-without-user-information | --no-include-queries-with-
       out-user-information (boolean)
              TRUE  to  include  queries  without  user  information (i.e. all
              queries, irrespective of the  user),  otherwise  FALSE  to  only
              include queries with user information.

          If  you  pass  user  information  to  Amazon  Kendra  along with the
          queries, you can set this flag to FALSE and instruct  Amazon  Kendra
          to only consider queries with user information.

          If  you set to FALSE , Amazon Kendra only considers queries searched
          at least MinimumQueryCount times across MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers
          unique users for suggestions.

          If  you set to TRUE , Amazon Kendra ignores all user information and
          learns from all queries.

       --minimum-number-of-querying-users (integer)
          The minimum number of unique users who must search a query in  order
          for the query to be eligible to suggest to your users.

          Increasing  this  number  might  decrease the number of suggestions.
          However, this ensures a query is searched by many users and is truly
          popular to suggest to users.

          How you tune this setting depends on your specific needs.

       --minimum-query-count (integer)
          The the minimum number of times a query must be searched in order to
          be eligible to suggest to your users.

          Decreasing this number increases the number of suggestions. However,
          this  affects  the quality of suggestions as it sets a low bar for a
          query to be considered popular to suggest to users.

          How you tune this setting depends on your specific needs.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
