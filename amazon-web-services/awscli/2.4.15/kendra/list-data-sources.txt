NAME
       list-data-sources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the data sources that you have created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-data-sources
          --index-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that contains the data source.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon  Kendra  returns  a  pagination  token  in  the
          response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set
          of data sources (DataSourceSummaryItems ).

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of data sources to return.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SummaryItems -> (list)
          An array of summary information for one or more data sources.

          (structure)
              Summary information for a Amazon Kendra data source. Returned in
              a call to the DescribeDataSource operation.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the data source.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the data source.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the data source.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The UNIX datetime that the data source was created.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The UNIX datetime that the data source was lasted updated.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status of the data source. When the status is ACTIVE the
                 data source is ready to use.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The code for a language. This shows a supported language  for
                 all  documents  in  the  data source. English is supported by
                 default. For more information on supported languages, includ-
                 ing their codes, see Adding documents in languages other than
                 English .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Kendra returns this token  that
          you  can  use  in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of
          data sources.
