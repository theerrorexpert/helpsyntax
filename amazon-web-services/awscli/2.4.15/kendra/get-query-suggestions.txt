DESCRIPTION

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-query-suggestions
          --index-id <value>
          --query-text <value>
          [--max-suggestions-count <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to get query suggestions  from.

       --query-text (string)
          The text of a user's query to generate query suggestions.

          A  query is suggested if the query prefix matches what a user starts
          to type as their query.

          Amazon Kendra does not show any suggestions if a  user  types  fewer
          than  two  characters  or more than 60 characters. A query must also
          have at least one search result and contain at  least  one  word  of
          more than four characters.

       --max-suggestions-count (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  query suggestions you want to show to your
          users.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
