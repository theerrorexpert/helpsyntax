DESCRIPTION
       Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore dif-
       ferent dimensions of database load based on data captured from  a  run-
       ning DB instance. The guide provides detailed information about Perfor-
       mance Insights data types, parameters and errors.

       When Performance  Insights  is  enabled,  the  Amazon  RDS  Performance
       Insights  API  provides  visibility  into  the  performance  of your DB
       instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for  Ama-
       zon   Web   Services  service-vended  monitoring  metrics.  Performance
       Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB load.

       DB load is measured as average active  sessions.  Performance  Insights
       provides  the  data  to  API consumers as a two-dimensional time-series
       dataset. The time dimension provides DB load data for each  time  point
       in  the  queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall load in
       relation to the requested dimensions,  measured  at  that  time  point.
       Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.
