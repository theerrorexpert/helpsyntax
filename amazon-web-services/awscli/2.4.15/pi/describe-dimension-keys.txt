NAME
       describe-dimension-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a  specific  time  period, retrieve the top N dimension keys for a
       metric.

       NOTE:
          Each response element returns a maximum of  500  bytes.  For  larger
          elements,  such  as  SQL  statements,  only  the first 500 bytes are
          returned.

OPTIONS
       --service-type (string)
          The Amazon Web Services service for which Performance Insights  will
          return metrics. The only valid value for ServiceType is RDS .

          Possible values:

          o RDS

          o DOCDB

       --identifier (string)
          An  immutable,  Amazon  Web  Services Region-unique identifier for a
          data source. Performance Insights gathers  metrics  from  this  data
          source.

          To  use  an  Amazon  RDS  instance as a data source, you specify its
          DbiResourceId   value.   For   example,    specify    db-FAIHNTYBKT-
          GAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A .

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  specifying the beginning of the requested time
          series data. You must specify a StartTime within the  past  7  days.
          The  value  specified  is  inclusive  , which means that data points
          equal to or greater than StartTime are returned.

          The value for StartTime must be earlier than the value for EndTime .

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time specifying the end of the requested time series
          data. The value specified is  exclusive  ,  which  means  that  data
          points less than (but not equal to) EndTime are returned.

          The value for EndTime must be later than the value for StartTime .

       --metric (string)
          The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

          Valid values for Metric are:

          o db.load.avg - a scaled representation of the number of active ses-
            sions for the database engine.

          o db.sampledload.avg - the raw number of  active  sessions  for  the
            database engine.

          If  the  number  of active sessions is less than an internal Perfor-
          mance Insights threshold, db.load.avg and db.sampledload.avg are the
          same  value.  If  the  number of active sessions is greater than the
          internal threshold, Performance Insights  samples  the  active  ses-
          sions,  with  db.load.avg  showing  the  scaled  values, db.sampled-
          load.avg showing the raw values, and  db.sampledload.avg  less  than
          db.load.avg . For most use cases, you can query db.load.avg only.

       --period-in-seconds (integer)
          The  granularity,  in seconds, of the data points returned from Per-
          formance Insights. A period can be as short as  one  second,  or  as
          long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

          o 1 (one second)

          o 60 (one minute)

          o 300 (five minutes)

          o 3600 (one hour)

          o 86400 (twenty-four hours)

          If  you  don't  specify  PeriodInSeconds , then Performance Insights
          chooses a value for you, with a goal of  returning  roughly  100-200
          data points in the response.

       --group-by (structure)
          A  specification  for  how to aggregate the data points from a query
          result. You  must  specify  a  valid  dimension  group.  Performance
          Insights  returns  all dimensions within this group, unless you pro-
          vide the names of specific dimensions within  this  group.  You  can
          also  request  that  Performance Insights return a limited number of
          values for a dimension.

          Group -> (string)
              The name of the dimension group. Valid values are:

              The maximum number of items to fetch for this dimension group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Group=string,Dimensions=string,string,Limit=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Group": "string",

            "Limit": integer
          }

       --filter (map)
          One or more filters to apply in the request. Restrictions:

          o Any  number  of filters by the same dimension, as specified in the
            GroupBy or Partition parameters.

          o A single filter for any other dimension in this dimension group.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return in the response. If more items
          exist  than  the  specified  MaxRecords value, a pagination token is
          included in the response  so  that  the  remaining  results  can  be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the token, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe dimension keys

       This  example requests the names of all wait events. The data is summa-
       rized by event name, and the aggregate values of those events over  the
       specified time period.

       Command:

OUTPUT
       AlignedStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The start time for the returned dimension keys, after alignment to a
          granular boundary (as specified by PeriodInSeconds ).  AlignedStart-
          Time  will  be less than or equal to the value of the user-specified
          StartTime .

       AlignedEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The end time for the returned dimension keys, after alignment  to  a
          granular boundary (as specified by PeriodInSeconds ). AlignedEndTime
          will be greater than or equal to the  value  of  the  user-specified
          Endtime .

       PartitionKeys -> (list)
          If  PartitionBy  was  present in the request, PartitionKeys contains
          the breakdown of dimension keys by the specified partitions.

          (structure)
              If PartitionBy was specified in a DescribeDimensionKeys request,
              the  dimensions  are  returned  in an array. Each element in the
              array specifies one dimension.

              Dimensions -> (map)
                 A dimension map that contains the dimensions for this  parti-
                 tion.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Keys -> (list)
          The dimension keys that were requested.

          (structure)
              An  object  that includes the requested dimension key values and
              aggregated metric values within a dimension group.

              Dimensions -> (map)
                 A map of name-value pairs for the dimensions in the group.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              Total -> (double)
                 The aggregated metric value  for  the  dimensions,  over  the
                 requested time range.

              AdditionalMetrics -> (map)
                 A map that contains the value for each additional metric.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (double)

              Partitions -> (list)
                 If  PartitionBy  was  specified,  PartitionKeys  contains the
                 dimensions that were.

                 (double)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token that indicates  the  response  didnt  return  all
          available  records  because MaxRecords was specified in the previous
          request. To get the remaining records, specify NextToken in a  sepa-
          rate request with this value.
