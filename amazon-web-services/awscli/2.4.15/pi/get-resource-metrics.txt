NAME
       get-resource-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve Performance Insights metrics for a set of data sources, over a
       time period. You can provide specific dimension groups and  dimensions,
       and provide aggregation and filtering criteria for each group.

       NOTE:
          Each  response  element  returns  a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger
          elements, such as SQL statements,  only  the  first  500  bytes  are
          returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-metrics
          --service-type <value>
          --identifier <value>
          --metric-queries <value>
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--period-in-seconds <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-type (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  service  for  which Performance Insights
          returns metrics. The only valid value for ServiceType is RDS .

          Possible values:

          o RDS

          o DOCDB

       --identifier (string)
          An immutable, Amazon Web Services  Region-unique  identifier  for  a
          data  source.  Performance  Insights  gathers metrics from this data
          source.

          To use a DB instance as a data  source,  specify  its  DbiResourceId
          value. For example, specify db-FAIHNTYBKTGAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A .

       --metric-queries (list)
          An  array of one or more queries to perform. Each query must specify
          a Performance Insights metric, and can optionally  specify  aggrega-
          tion and filtering criteria.

          (structure)
              A  single  query to be processed. You must provide the metric to
              query.  If  no  other  parameters  are  specified,   Performance
              Insights  returns  all  data  points  for  the specified metric.
              Optionally, you can request that the data points  be  aggregated
              by dimension group (GroupBy ), and return only those data points
              that match your criteria (Filter ).

              Metric -> (string)
                 The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

                 Valid values for Metric are:

                 o db.load.avg - a scaled  representation  of  the  number  of
                   active sessions for the database engine.

                 o db.sampledload.avg  - the raw number of active sessions for
                   the database engine.

                 If the number of active sessions is  less  than  an  internal
                 Performance  Insights  threshold, db.load.avg and db.sampled-
                 load.avg are the same value. If the number of active sessions
                 is  greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights
                 samples the active sessions,  with  db.load.avg  showing  the
                 scaled values, db.sampledload.avg showing the raw values, and
                 db.sampledload.avg less  than  db.load.avg  .  For  most  use
                 cases, you can query db.load.avg only.

              GroupBy -> (structure)
                 A  specification  for how to aggregate the data points from a
                 query result. You must specify a valid dimension group.  Per-
                 formance  Insights  will  return all of the dimensions within
                 that group, unless you provide the names of  specific  dimen-
                 sions  within  that  group. You can also request that Perfor-
                 mance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimen-
                 sion.

                 Group -> (string)
                     The name of the dimension group. Valid values are:

                     o db.session_type - The type of the current session (only
                       Aurora PostgreSQL and RDS PostgreSQL)

                     o db.sql  -  The  SQL  that  is  currently executing (all

                 Dimensions -> (list)
                     A  list of specific dimensions from a dimension group. If
                     this parameter is not present, then it signifies that all
                     of  the  dimensions  in  the group were requested, or are
                     present in the response.

                   group.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Metric=string,GroupBy={Group=string,Dimensions=[string,string],Limit=integer},Filter={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Metric": "string",
              "GroupBy": {
                "Group": "string",
                "Dimensions": ["string", ...],
                "Limit": integer
              },
              "Filter": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  specifying the beginning of the requested time
          series data. You can't specify a StartTime  that's  earlier  than  7
          days ago. The value specified is inclusive - data points equal to or
          greater than StartTime will be returned.

          The value for StartTime must be earlier than the value for EndTime .

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time specifying the end of the requested time series
          data. The value specified is exclusive - data points less than  (but
          not equal to) EndTime will be returned.

          The value for EndTime must be later than the value for StartTime .

       --period-in-seconds (integer)
          The  granularity,  in seconds, of the data points returned from Per-
          formance Insights. A period can be as short as  one  second,  or  as
          long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

          o 1 (one second)

          o 60 (one minute)

          o 300 (five minutes)

          o 3600 (one hour)

          o 86400 (twenty-four hours)

          If  you  don't  specify  PeriodInSeconds , then Performance Insights
          will choose a value for  you,  with  a  goal  of  returning  roughly
          100-200 data points in the response.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return in the response. If more items
          exist than the specified MaxRecords value,  a  pagination  token  is
          included  in  the  response  so  that  the  remaining results can be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the token, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get resource metrics

       This example requests  data  points  for  the  db.wait_event  dimension
       group,  and  for the db.wait_event.name dimension within that group. In
       the response, the relevant data points are  grouped  by  the  requested
       dimension (db.wait_event.name).

       Command:

          aws pi get-resource-metrics --service-type RDS --identifier db-LKCGOBK26374TPTDFXOIWVCPPM --start-time 1527026400 --end-time 1527080400 --period-in-seconds 300 --metric db.load.avg --metric-queries file://metric-queries.json

       The  arguments  for  --metric-queries  are  stored in a JSON file, met-
       ric-queries.json.  Here are the contents of that file:

          [
              {
                  "Metric": "db.load.avg",
                  "GroupBy": {

                  }
              }
          ]

OUTPUT
       AlignedStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The start time for the returned metrics, after alignment to a granu-
          lar  boundary  (as  specified by PeriodInSeconds ). AlignedStartTime
          will be less than or equal to the value of the user-specified Start-
          Time .

       AlignedEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The end time for the returned metrics, after alignment to a granular
          boundary (as specified by PeriodInSeconds ). AlignedEndTime will  be
          greater than or equal to the value of the user-specified Endtime .

       Identifier -> (string)
          An  immutable,  Amazon  Web  Services Region-unique identifier for a
          data source. Performance Insights gathers  metrics  from  this  data
          source.

          To use a DB instance as a data source, you specify its DbiResourceId
          value - for example: db-FAIHNTYBKTGAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A

       MetricList -> (list)
          An array of metric results,, where each array element  contains  all
          of the data points for a particular dimension.

          (structure)
              A  time-ordered series of data points, corresponding to a dimen-
              sion of a Performance Insights metric.

              Key -> (structure)
                 The dimensions to which the data points apply.

                 Metric -> (string)
                     The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

                     Valid values for Metric are:

                     o db.load.avg  - a scaled representation of the number of
                       active sessions for the database engine.

                     o db.sampledload.avg - the raw number of active  sessions
                       for the database engine.

                     If the number of active sessions is less than an internal
                     Performance Insights threshold, db.load.avg  and  db.sam-
                     pledload.avg  are the same value. If the number of active
                     sessions is greater than the internal threshold,  Perfor-
                     mance   Insights   samples   the  active  sessions,  with
                     db.load.avg showing the scaled values, db.sampledload.avg
                     showing  the raw values, and db.sampledload.avg less than
                     db.load.avg  .  For  most  use  cases,  you   can   query
                     db.load.avg only.

                 Dimensions -> (map)
                     The valid dimensions for the metric.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              DataPoints -> (list)
                 An  array of timestamp-value pairs, representing measurements
                 over a period of time.

                 (structure)
                     A timestamp, and a single numerical value, which together
                     represent a measurement at a particular point in time.

                     Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                        The  time, in epoch format, associated with a particu-
                        lar Value .

                     Value -> (double)
                        The actual value associated with  a  particular  Time-
                        stamp .

       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the token, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
