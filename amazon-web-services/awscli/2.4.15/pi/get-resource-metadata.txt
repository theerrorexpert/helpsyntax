GET-RESOURCE-METADATA()                                GET-RESOURCE-METADATA()



NAME
       get-resource-metadata -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve the metadata for different features. For example, the metadata
       might indicate that a feature is turned on or  off  on  a  specific  DB
       instance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-metadata
          --service-type <value>
          --identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-type (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  service  for  which Performance Insights
          returns metrics.

          Possible values:

          o RDS

          o DOCDB

       --identifier (string)
          An immutable identifier for a data source that is unique for an Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Region. Performance Insights gathers metrics from
          this data source. To use a DB instance as a data source, specify its
          DbiResourceId    value.    For    example,   specify   db-ABCDEFGHI-
          JKLMNOPQRSTU1VW2X .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Identifier -> (string)
          An immutable identifier for a data source that is unique for an Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Region. Performance Insights gathers metrics from
          this data source. To use a DB instance as a data source, specify its
          DbiResourceId    value.    For    example,   specify   db-ABCDEFGHI-
          JKLMNOPQRSTU1VW2X .

       Features -> (map)
          The metadata for different features. For example, the metadata might
          indicate  that  a  feature  is  turned  on  or  off on a specific DB
          instance.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The metadata for a feature.  For  example,  the  metadata  might
              indicate  that  a  feature  is turned on or off on a specific DB
              instance.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the feature on the DB instance. Possible values
                 include the following:

                 o ENABLED : the feature is enabled on the instance.

                 o DISABLED : the feature is disabled on the instance.

                 o UNSUPPORTED  : the feature isn't supported on the instance.

                 o ENABLED_PENDING_REBOOT : the  feature  is  enabled  on  the
                   instance but requires a reboot to take effect.

                 o DISABLED_PENDING_REBOOT  :  the  feature is disabled on the
                   instance but requires a reboot to take effect.

                 o UNKNOWN : the feature status couldn't be determined.
