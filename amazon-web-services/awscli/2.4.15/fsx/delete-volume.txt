SYNOPSIS
            delete-volume
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          --volume-id <value>
          [--ontap-configuration <value>]
          [--open-zfs-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --volume-id (string)
          The ID of the volume that you are deleting.

       --ontap-configuration (structure)
          For  Amazon  FSx  for ONTAP volumes, specify whether to take a final
          backup of the volume and apply tags to the backup. To apply tags  to
          the backup, you must have the fsx:TagResource permission.

          SkipFinalBackup -> (boolean)
              Set  to  true  if  you want to skip taking a final backup of the
              volume you are deleting.

          FinalBackupTags -> (list)
              A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the  tag.
                     Tag  keys  must  be unique for the resource to which they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned
                     to  the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and
                     don't have to be unique in a tag set.  For  example,  you
                     can  have  a  key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SkipFinalBackup=boolean,FinalBackupTags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SkipFinalBackup": true|false,
            "FinalBackupTags": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --open-zfs-configuration (structure)
          For Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volumes, specify whether  to  delete  all
          child volumes and snapshots.

          Options -> (list)
              To delete the volume's child volumes, snapshots, and clones, use
              the string DELETE_CHILD_VOLUMES_AND_SNAPSHOTS .

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Options=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Options": ["DELETE_CHILD_VOLUMES_AND_SNAPSHOTS", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VolumeId -> (string)
          The ID of the volume that's being deleted.

       Lifecycle -> (string)
          The lifecycle state of the volume being deleted. If the DeleteVolume
          operation is successful, this value is DELETING .

       OntapResponse -> (structure)
          Returned  after  a  DeleteVolume  request, showing the status of the
          delete request.

          FinalBackupId -> (string)
              The ID of the source backup. Specifies the backup that  you  are
              copying.

          FinalBackupTags -> (list)
              A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.
                     Tag keys must be unique for the resource  to  which  they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned
                     to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and
                     don't  have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you
                     can have a key-value pair in a  tag  set  of  finances  :
                     April and also of payroll : April .
