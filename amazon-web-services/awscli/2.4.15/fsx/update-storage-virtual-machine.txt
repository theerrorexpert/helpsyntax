OPTIONS
       --active-directory-configuration (structure)
          Updates the Microsoft Active Directory (AD) configuration for an SVM
          that is joined to an AD.

          SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration that Amazon FSx uses to join the Windows  File
              Server  instance  to  a  self-managed Microsoft Active Directory
              (AD) directory.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The user name for the service account on your self-managed AD
                 domain  that  Amazon  FSx will use to join to your AD domain.
                 This account must have the permission to  join  computers  to
                 the  domain  in the organizational unit provided in Organiza-
                 tionalUnitDistinguishedName .

              Password -> (string)
                 The password for the service account on your self-managed  AD
                 domain that Amazon FSx will use to join to your AD domain.

              DnsIps -> (list)
                 A  list  of up to three IP addresses of DNS servers or domain
                 controllers in the self-managed AD directory.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration={UserName=string,Password=string,DnsIps=[string,string]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration": {
              "UserName": "string",
              "Password": "string",
              "DnsIps": ["string", ...]
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --storage-virtual-machine-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  SVM  that  you  want  to  update,  in  the  format
          svm-0123456789abcdef0 .

       --svm-admin-password (string)
          Enter a new SvmAdminPassword if you are updating it.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
