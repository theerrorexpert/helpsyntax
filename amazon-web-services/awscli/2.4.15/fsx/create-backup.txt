CREATE-BACKUP()                                                CREATE-BACKUP()



NAME
       create-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file
       system, Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, Amazon FSx for NetApp  ONTAP
       volume,  or  Amazon  FSx for OpenZFS file system. We recommend creating
       regular backups so that you can restore a file system or volume from  a
       backup if an issue arises with the original file system or volume.

       For  Amazon  FSx  for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only
       for file systems that have the following configuration:

       o A Persistent deployment type

       o Are not linked to a data repository

       For more information about backups, see the following:

       o For Amazon FSx for Lustre, see Working with FSx for Lustre backups  .

       o For  Amazon FSx for Windows, see Working with FSx for Windows backups
         .

       o For Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, see  Working  with  FSx  for  NetApp
         ONTAP backups .

       o For  Amazon FSx for OpenZFS, see Working with FSx for OpenZFS backups
         .

       If a backup with the specified client  request  token  exists  and  the
       parameters  match, this operation returns the description of the exist-
       ing backup. If a backup with the specified client request token  exists
       and  the parameters don't match, this operation returns IncompatiblePa-
       rameterError . If a backup with  the  specified  client  request  token
       doesn't exist, CreateBackup does the following:

       o Creates  a  new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial
         lifecycle state of CREATING .

       o Returns the description of the backup.

       By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateBackup  opera-
       tion without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be
       useful when an initial call fails  in  a  way  that  makes  it  unclear
       whether  a backup was created. If you use the same client request token
       and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a success-
       ful result because all the parameters are the same.

       The  CreateBackup  operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state
       is still CREATING . You can check the backup creation status by calling
       the  DescribeBackups  operation,  which  returns the backup state along
       with other information.

SYNOPSIS
            create-backup
          [--file-system-id <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--volume-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system to back up.

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) A string of up to 64 ASCII  characters  that  Amazon  FSx
          uses  to  ensure  idempotent  creation. This string is automatically
          filled on your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface  (CLI)
          or an Amazon Web Services SDK.

       --tags (list)
          (Optional)  The  tags to apply to the backup at backup creation. The
          key value of the Name tag appears in the console as the backup name.
          If  you  have set CopyTagsToBackups to true , and you specify one or
          more tags using the CreateBackup operation, no existing file  system
          tags are copied from the file system to the backup.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag. Tag
                 keys must be unique  for  the  resource  to  which  they  are
                 attached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned to
                 the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and  don't
                 have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a
                 key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April and  also  of
                 payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --volume-id (string)
          (Optional) The ID of the FSx for ONTAP volume to back up.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 o DELETING - Amazon FSx is deleting an existing file  system.

                 o FAILED  -  An existing file system has experienced an unre-
                   coverable failure. When creating a new file system,  Amazon
                   FSx was unable to create the file system.

                 o MISCONFIGURED - The file system is in a failed but recover-
                   able state.

              StorageType -> (string)
                 The type of storage the file system is using. If set to SSD ,
                 the file system uses solid state drive storage. If set to HDD
                 , the file system uses hard disk drive storage.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  primary virtual private cloud (VPC) for the

                 Specifies the IDs of the subnets  that  the  file  system  is
                 accessible  from.  For  the  Amazon  FSx  Windows  and  ONTAP
                 MULTI_AZ_1 file system deployment type, there are two  subnet
                 IDs,  one  for  the  preferred  file  server  and one for the
                 standby file server. The preferred file server subnet identi-
                 fied  in  the PreferredSubnetID property. All other file sys-
                 tems have only one subnet ID.

                 For FSx for Lustre file systems, and Single-AZ  Windows  file
                 systems,  this is the ID of the subnet that contains the file
                 system's endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows and ONTAP file sys-
                 tems, the file system endpoint is available in the Preferred-
                 SubnetID .

                 (string)
                     The ID for a subnet. A subnet is a range of IP  addresses
                     in  your  virtual  private cloud (VPC). For more informa-
                     tion, see VPC and subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

              NetworkInterfaceIds -> (list)
                 The IDs of the elastic network interfaces from which  a  spe-
                 cific  file  system is accessible. The elastic network inter-
                 face is automatically created in  the  same  virtual  private
                 cloud  (VPC)  that the Amazon FSx file system was created in.
                 For more information, see Elastic Network Interfaces  in  the
                 Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                 For  an  Amazon  FSx for Windows File Server file system, you
                 can have one network interface ID. For an Amazon FSx for Lus-
                 tre file system, you can have more than one.

                 (string)
                     An  elastic  network  interface  ID.  An  elastic network
                     interface is a logical networking component in a  virtual
                     private  cloud  (VPC)  that  represents a virtual network
                     card. For more information, see  Elastic  Network  Inter-
                     faces  in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

              DNSName -> (string)
                 The Domain Name System (DNS) name for the file system.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the  Key  Management  Service  (KMS)  key  used  to
                 encrypt  the  file  system's  data for Amazon FSx for Windows
                 File Server file systems, Amazon FSx for  NetApp  ONTAP  file
                 systems, and PERSISTENT Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems at
                 rest. If this ID isn't specified, the Amazon FSx-managed  key
                 for  your  account is used. The scratch Amazon FSx for Lustre
                 file systems are always encrypted at rest  using  the  Amazon
                 FSx-managed  key  for your account. For more information, see
                 Encrypt in the Key Management Service API Reference .

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the file system  resource.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to associate with the file system. For more informa-
                 tion, see Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon EC2
                 User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                     Key -> (string)

                        tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which
                        they are attached.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A  value  that  specifies  the  TagValue  ,  the value
                        assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag values  can
                        be  null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For
                        example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of
                        finances : April and also of payroll : April .

                     Amazon FSx Remote PowerShell.

                     For SINGLE_AZ_1 and SINGLE_AZ_2 deployment types, this is
                     the DNS name of the file system.

                     This  endpoint  is  temporarily unavailable when the file
                     system is undergoing maintenance.

                 PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
                     For MULTI_AZ_1 deployment types, it specifies the  ID  of
                     the  subnet  where  the preferred file server is located.
                     Must be one of the two subnet IDs specified in  SubnetIds
                     property.  Amazon  FSx  serves  traffic  from this subnet
                     except in the event of a failover to the  secondary  file
                     server.

                     For  SINGLE_AZ_1  and  SINGLE_AZ_2 deployment types, this
                     value is the same as that for SubnetIDs . For more infor-
                     mation,  see  Availability  and durability: Single-AZ and
                     Multi-AZ file systems .

                 PreferredFileServerIp -> (string)
                     For MULTI_AZ_1 deployment types, the IP  address  of  the
                     primary, or preferred, file server.

                     Use  this  IP  address  when  mounting the file system on
                     Linux SMB clients or Windows SMB  clients  that  are  not
                     joined  to  a  Microsoft Active Directory. Applicable for
                     all Windows file system deployment types. This IP address
                     is temporarily unavailable when the file system is under-
                     going maintenance. For Linux and Windows SMB clients that
                     are  joined to an Active Directory, use the file system's
                     DNSName instead. For  more  information  on  mapping  and
                     mounting file shares, see Accessing File Shares .

                 ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)
                     The throughput of the Amazon FSx file system, measured in
                     megabytes per second.

                 MaintenanceOperationsInProgress -> (list)
                     The list of maintenance operations in progress  for  this
                     file system.

                     (string)
                        An  enumeration specifying the currently ongoing main-
                        tenance operation.

                 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                     The preferred start time to perform  weekly  maintenance,
                     formatted  d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone. d is the weekday
                     number, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and  end-
                     ing with Sunday.

                 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                     The  preferred  time  to take daily automatic backups, in
                     the UTC time zone.

                 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                     The number of days to retain automatic  backups.  Setting
                     this  to  0  disables  automatic  backups. You can retain
                     automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days.

                 CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                     A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system
                     should  be  copied  to  backups.  This  value defaults to
                     false. If it's set to true, all tags on the  file  system
                     are  copied  to all automatic backups and any user-initi-
                     ated backups where the user doesn't specify any tags.  If
                     this  value  is  true,  and you specify one or more tags,
                     only the specified tags are copied  to  backups.  If  you
                     specify  one  or more tags when creating a user-initiated
                     backup, no tags are copied from the file system,  regard-
                     less of this value.

                 Aliases -> (list)
                     An  array  of  one or more DNS aliases that are currently
                     associated with the Amazon FSx file system. Aliases allow
                     you  to use existing DNS names to access the data in your
                     Amazon FSx file  system.  You  can  associate  up  to  50
                     aliases with a file system at any time. You can associate
                     additional DNS aliases after you create the  file  system
                     using  the  AssociateFileSystemAliases operation. You can
                     remove DNS aliases from the file system after it is  cre-
                     ated  using  the DisassociateFileSystemAliases operation.
                     You only need to specify the alias name  in  the  request
                     payload. For more information, see DNS aliases .

                     (structure)
                        A  DNS  alias that is associated with the file system.
                        You can use a DNS alias to access a file system  using
                        user-defined DNS names, in addition to the default DNS
                        name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file  system.  For
                        more  information, see DNS aliases in the FSx for Win-
                        dows File Server User Guide .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the DNS alias. The alias name  has  to
                            meet the following requirements:

                            o Formatted   as  a  fully-qualified  domain  name
                              (FQDN), hostname.domain , for example,  account-
                              ing.example.com .

                            o Can  contain alphanumeric characters, the under-
                              score (_), and the hyphen (-).

                            o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                            o Can start with a numeric.

                            For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic  char-
                            acters  as  lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of
                            how you specify them: as uppercase letters, lower-
                            case  letters,  or  the  corresponding  letters in
                            escape codes.

                        Lifecycle -> (string)
                            Describes the state of the DNS alias.

                            o AVAILABLE - The DNS alias is associated with  an
                              Amazon FSx file system.

                            o CREATING  - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS alias
                              and associating it with the file system.

                            o CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable  to  asso-
                              ciate the DNS alias with the file system.

                            o DELETING  - Amazon FSx is disassociating the DNS
                              alias from the file system and deleting it.

                            o DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to  disas-
                              sociate the DNS alias from the file system.

                 AuditLogConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The configuration that Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
                     uses to audit and log user accesses  of  files,  folders,
                     and file shares on the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
                     file system.

                     FileAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                        Sets which attempt type is logged by  Amazon  FSx  for
                        file and folder accesses.

                        o SUCCESS_ONLY  -  only  successful attempts to access
                          files or folders are logged.

                        o FAILURE_ONLY - only failed attempts to access  files
                          or folders are logged.

                        o SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE  -  both successful attempts and
                          failed attempts  to  access  files  or  folders  are
                          logged.

                        o DISABLED  -  access auditing of files and folders is
                          turned off.

                     FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                        Sets which attempt type is logged by  Amazon  FSx  for
                        file share accesses.

                        o SUCCESS_ONLY  -  only  successful attempts to access

                        o DISABLED - access auditing of file shares is  turned
                          off.

                     AuditLogDestination -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the destination of
                        the audit logs. The  destination  can  be  any  Amazon
                        CloudWatch  Logs  log group ARN or Amazon Kinesis Data
                        Firehose delivery stream ARN.

                        The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group  must
                        begin with the /aws/fsx prefix. The name of the Amazon

                     The  data repository configuration object for Lustre file
                     systems returned in the response of the  CreateFileSystem
                     operation.

                     This data type is not supported for file systems with the
                     Persistent_2 deployment type. Instead, use .

                     Lifecycle -> (string)
                        Describes the state of the file  system's  S3  durable
                        data repository, if it is configured with an S3 repos-
                        itory. The lifecycle can have the following values:

                        o CREATING - The data repository configuration between
                          the  FSx  file system and the linked S3 data reposi-
                          tory  is  being  created.  The  data  repository  is
                          unavailable.

                        o AVAILABLE  -  The  data  repository is available for
                          use.

                        o MISCONFIGURED  -  Amazon  FSx  cannot  automatically
                          import  updates  from  the  S3 bucket until the data
                          repository  configuration  is  corrected.  For  more
                          information,  see  Troubleshooting  a  Misconfigured
                          linked S3 bucket .

                        o UPDATING - The data repository is undergoing a  cus-
                          tomer  initiated  update  and  availability  may  be
                          impacted.

                        o FAILED - The data repository is in a terminal  state
                          that cannot be recovered.

                     ImportPath -> (string)
                        The  import path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and optional
                        prefix) that you're using as the data  repository  for
                        your   FSx   for   Lustre  file  system,  for  example
                        s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix . If  a  prefix  is
                        specified after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object
                        keys with that prefix are loaded into the file system.

                     ExportPath -> (string)
                        The  export  path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix)
                        that you are using to store  new  and  changed  Lustre
                        file system files in S3.

                     ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                        For  files imported from a data repository, this value
                        determines the stripe count and maximum amount of data
                        per  file  (in  MiB) stored on a single physical disk.
                        The maximum number of disks that a single file can  be
                        striped across is limited by the total number of disks
                        that make up the file system.

                        The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go
                        as  high  as  512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects
                        have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                     AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                        Describes the file system's  linked  S3  data  reposi-
                        tory's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoImportPolicy config-
                        ures how Amazon FSx  keeps  your  file  and  directory
                        listings  up  to  date as you add or modify objects in
                        your linked S3 bucket. AutoImportPolicy can  have  the
                        following values:

                        o NONE  - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only
                          updates file and directory listings from the  linked
                          S3  bucket when the file system is created. FSx does
                          not update file and directory listings for  any  new
                          or changed objects after choosing this option.

                        o NEW  -  AutoImport  is  on. Amazon FSx automatically
                          imports directory listings of any new objects  added
                          to  the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist
                          in the FSx file system.

                        o NEW_CHANGED - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automati-
                          cally imports file and directory listings of any new
                          objects added to the  S3  bucket  and  any  existing
                          objects  that are changed in the S3 bucket after you
                          choose this option.

                        o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport is on.  Amazon  FSx
                          automatically imports file and directory listings of
                          any new objects added to the S3 bucket, any existing
                          objects  that  are changed in the S3 bucket, and any
                          objects that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                     FailureDetails -> (structure)
                        Provides detailed information about the data  resposi-
                        tory  if  its  Lifecycle  is  set  to MISCONFIGURED or
                        FAILED .

                        Message -> (string)
                            A detailed error message.

                 DeploymentType -> (string)
                     The deployment type of the FSx for  Lustre  file  system.
                     Scratch deployment type is designed for temporary storage
                     and shorter-term processing of data.
                        SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment  types  are  best
                        suited   for  when  you  need  temporary  storage  and
                        shorter-term processing of data. The SCRATCH_2 deploy-
                        ment  type  provides in-transit encryption of data and
                        higher burst throughput capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                     The PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment type is used
                     for  longer-term  storage and workloads and encryption of
                     data in transit. PERSISTENT_2 is built  on  Lustre  v2.12
                     and  offers  higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput (up to 1000
                     MB/s/TiB) along with a  lower  minimum  storage  capacity
                     requirement (600 GiB). To learn more about FSx for Lustre
                     deployment types, see FSx for Lustre deployment options .

                     The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                 PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                     Per  unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per
                     second of read or write  throughput  per  1  tebibyte  of
                     storage  provisioned.  File system throughput capacity is
                     equal to Storage capacity (TiB) *  PerUnitStorageThrough-
                     put  (MB/s/TiB).  This  option  is only valid for PERSIS-
                     TENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types.

                     Valid values:

                     o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                     o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                     o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000.

                 MountName -> (string)
                     You use the MountName value when mounting the  file  sys-
                     tem.

                     For  the  SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value is always
                     "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 ,  and  PERSISTENT_2
                     deployment  types,  this value is a string that is unique
                     within an Amazon Web Services Region.

                 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                     A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM . HH  is  the
                     zero-padded  hour  of  the  day  (0-23),  and  MM  is the
                     zero-padded minute of the hour. For example, 05:00 speci-
                     fies 5 AM daily.

                 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                     The  number  of days to retain automatic backups. Setting
                     this property to 0 disables automatic  backups.  You  can
                     retain  automatic  backups  for a maximum of 90 days. The
                     default is 0 .

                 CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                     A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system
                     are  copied  to backups. If it's set to true, all tags on
                     the file system are copied to all automatic  backups  and
                     any user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify
                     any tags. If this value is true, and you specify  one  or
                     more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups.
                     If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-ini-
                     tiated  backup,  no tags are copied from the file system,
                     regardless of this value. (Default = false)

                 DriveCacheType -> (string)
                     The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems
                     that  are  provisioned  with  HDD  storage  devices. This
                     parameter is required when StorageType is HDD.  When  set
                     to  READ the file system has an SSD storage cache that is
                     sized to 20% of the file system's storage capacity.  This
                     improves the performance for frequently accessed files by
                     caching up to 20% of the total storage capacity.

                     This parameter is required when  StorageType  is  set  to
                     HDD.

                 DataCompressionType -> (string)
                     The  data  compression configuration for the file system.
                     DataCompressionType can have the following values:

                     o NONE - Data compression is turned off for the file sys-
                       tem.

                     o LZ4  - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algo-
                       rithm.

                 LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The Lustre logging configuration. Lustre  logging  writes
                     the  enabled  log  events  for your file system to Amazon
                     CloudWatch Logs.

                     Level -> (string)
                        The data repository events that are logged  by  Amazon
                        FSx.

                        o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                        o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                        o WARN_ERROR  -  both  warning events and error events
                          are logged.

                        o DISABLED - logging  of  data  repository  events  is
                          turned off.

                     Destination -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the des-
                        tination of the logs. The destination can be any  Ama-
                        zon CloudWatch Logs log group ARN. The destination ARN
                        must be in the same  Amazon  Web  Services  partition,
                        Amazon  Web  Services  Region, and Amazon Web Services
                        account as your Amazon FSx file system.

              AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                 A list of administrative actions for the file system that are
                 in process or waiting to be processed. Administrative actions
                 describe changes to the Amazon FSx system that you have  ini-
                 tiated using the UpdateFileSystem operation.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for
                     the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file system.

                     AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                        Describes the type of administrative action,  as  fol-
                        lows:

                        o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  -  A file system update adminis-
                          trative action initiated from the  Amazon  FSx  con-
                          sole,    API    (UpdateFileSystem    ),    or    CLI
                          (update-file-system ).

                        o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION - After the  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                          task  to  increase  a file system's storage capacity
                          has been completed successfully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZA-
                          TION task starts.

                          o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization is the
                            process of migrating the file system data to newer
                            larger disks.

                          o For   Lustre,  storage  optimization  consists  of
                            rebalancing the data across the existing and newly
                            added file servers.

                        You  can track the storage-optimization progress using
                        the ProgressPercent property.  When  STORAGE_OPTIMIZA-
                        TION  has  been  completed  successfully,  the  parent
                        FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE action status changes to  COMPLETED
                        .  For more information, see Managing storage capacity

                          to  associate  a  new Domain Name System (DNS) alias
                          with the file  system.  For  more  information,  see
                          AssociateFileSystemAliases .

                        o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION  -  A  file  system
                          update to disassociate a DNS  alias  from  the  file
                          system.      For      more      information,     see
                          DisassociateFileSystemAliases .

                        o VOLUME_UPDATE - A volume update to an Amazon FSx for
                          NetApp ONTAP or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume initi-
                          ated from the Amazon FSx console, API  (UpdateVolume
                          ), or CLI (update-volume ).

                        o SNAPSHOT_UPDATE - A snapshot update to an Amazon FSx
                          for OpenZFS volume initiated  from  the  Amazon  FSx

                               this value is true, and you specify one or more
                               tags, only the specified  tags  are  copied  to
                               backups.  If  you specify one or more tags when
                               creating a user-initiated backup, no  tags  are
                               copied from the file system, regardless of this
                               value.

                            Aliases -> (list)
                               An array of one or more DNS  aliases  that  are
                               currently  associated  with the Amazon FSx file
                               system. Aliases allow you to use  existing  DNS
                               names  to  access  the  data in your Amazon FSx
                               file system. You can associate up to 50 aliases
                               with  a  file system at any time. You can asso-
                               ciate additional DNS aliases after  you  create
                               the  file  system  using  the AssociateFileSys-
                               temAliases  operation.  You  can   remove   DNS
                               aliases  from  the file system after it is cre-
                               ated  using  the  DisassociateFileSystemAliases
                               operation.  You  only need to specify the alias
                               name in the request payload. For more  informa-
                               tion, see DNS aliases .

                                   A  DNS  alias  that  is associated with the
                                   file system. You can use  a  DNS  alias  to
                                   access a file system using user-defined DNS
                                   names, in addition to the default DNS  name
                                   that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the  DNS  alias.  The  alias
                                      name  has to meet the following require-
                                      ments:

                                      o Formatted as a fully-qualified  domain
                                        name  (FQDN),  hostname.domain  ,  for
                                        example, accounting.example.com .

                                      o Can contain  alphanumeric  characters,
                                        the  underscore  (_),  and  the hyphen
                                        (-).

                                      o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                                      o Can start with a numeric.

                                      For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores  alpha-
                                      betic  characters  as  lowercase letters
                                      (a-z), regardless  of  how  you  specify
                                      them:  as  uppercase  letters, lowercase
                                      letters, or the corresponding letters in
                                      escape codes.

                                      o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating  the
                                        DNS  alias and associating it with the
                                        file system.

                                      o CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was  unable
                                        to  associate  the  DNS alias with the
                                        file system.

                                      o DELETING - Amazon FSx is  disassociat-
                                        ing the DNS alias from the file system
                                        and deleting it.

                                      o DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was  unable
                                        to disassociate the DNS alias from the
                                        file system.

                                     linked S3 data repository is  being  cre-
                                     ated. The data repository is unavailable.

                                   o AVAILABLE - The data repository is avail-
                                     able for use.

                                   o MISCONFIGURED  -  Amazon FSx cannot auto-
                                     matically  import  updates  from  the  S3

                                   file       system,       for        example
                                   s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix  .  If a
                                   prefix is specified  after  the  Amazon  S3
                                   bucket  name,  only  object  keys with that
                                   prefix are loaded into the file system.

                               ExportPath -> (string)

                                   maximum  amount  of  data per file (in MiB)
                                   stored on a single physical disk. The maxi-
                                   mum  number of disks that a single file can
                                   be striped across is limited by  the  total
                                   number  of disks that make up the file sys-
                                   tem.

                                   The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB)
                                   and  can  go  as  high  as 512,000 MiB (500
                                   GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size
                                   of 5 TB.

                               AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                                   Describes  the file system's linked S3 data
                                   repository's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoIm-
                                   portPolicy  configures how Amazon FSx keeps

                                   data respository if its Lifecycle is set to
                                   MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                                   Message -> (string)
                                      A detailed error message.

                            DeploymentType -> (string)
                               The deployment type of the FSx for Lustre  file
                               system. Scratch deployment type is designed for
                               temporary storage and  shorter-term  processing
                               of data.
                                   SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2  deployment types
                                   are best suited for when you need temporary
                                   storage   and  shorter-term  processing  of
                                   data. The SCRATCH_2  deployment  type  pro-
                                   vides  in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                   higher  burst  throughput   capacity   than
                                   SCRATCH_1 .

                               The  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                               type is used for longer-term storage and  work-
                               loads  and  encryption of data in transit. PER-
                               SISTENT_2 is built on Lustre v2.12  and  offers
                               higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up  to  1000
                               MB/s/TiB) along with a  lower  minimum  storage
                               capacity  requirement  (600 GiB). To learn more
                               about FSx for Lustre deployment types, see  FSx
                               for Lustre deployment options .

                               The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                            PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                               Per  unit  storage  throughput  represents  the
                               megabytes per second of read or write  through-
                               put per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File
                               system throughput capacity is equal to  Storage
                               capacity   (TiB)   *   PerUnitStorageThroughput
                               (MB/s/TiB). This option is only valid for  PER-
                               SISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types.

                               Valid values:

                               o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                               o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                               o For  PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500,
                                 1000.

                            MountName -> (string)
                               You use the MountName value when  mounting  the
                               file system.

                               For  the  SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value
                               is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 ,  PERSISTENT_1
                               , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types, this value
                               is a string that is unique within an Amazon Web
                               Services Region.

                            DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                               A  recurring  daily time, in the format HH:MM .
                               HH is the zero-padded hour of the  day  (0-23),
                               and  MM  is the zero-padded minute of the hour.
                               For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                            AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                               The number of days to retain automatic backups.
                               Setting  this  property to 0 disables automatic
                               backups. You can retain automatic backups for a
                               maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

                            CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                               A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags on the
                               file system are copied to backups. If it's  set
                               to true, all tags on the file system are copied
                               to all automatic backups and any user-initiated
                               backups  where  the  user  doesn't  specify any
                               tags. If this value is true,  and  you  specify
                               one  or  more tags, only the specified tags are
                               copied to backups. If you specify one  or  more
                               tags  when creating a user-initiated backup, no
                               tags are copied from the file  system,  regard-
                               less of this value. (Default = false)

                            DriveCacheType -> (string)
                               The  type  of  drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1
                               file systems  that  are  provisioned  with  HDD
                               storage  devices.  This  parameter  is required
                               when StorageType is HDD. When set to  READ  the
                               file  system  has  an SSD storage cache that is
                               sized to  20%  of  the  file  system's  storage
                               capacity.  This  improves  the  performance for
                               frequently accessed files by caching up to  20%
                               of the total storage capacity.

                               This  parameter is required when StorageType is
                               set to HDD.

                            DataCompressionType -> (string)
                               The data compression configuration for the file
                               system.  DataCompressionType  can have the fol-
                               lowing values:

                               o NONE - Data compression is turned off for the
                                 file system.

                               o LZ4  - Data compression is turned on with the
                                 LZ4 algorithm.

                               For more information, see Lustre data  compres-
                               sion .

                            LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                               The  Lustre  logging configuration. Lustre log-
                               ging writes the enabled  log  events  for  your
                               file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                               Level -> (string)
                                   The  data repository events that are logged
                                   by Amazon FSx.

                                   o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning  events   are
                                     logged.

                                   o ERROR_ONLY   -   only  error  events  are
                                     logged.

                                   o WARN_ERROR  -  both  warning  events  and
                                     error events are logged.

                                     events is turned off.

                               Destination -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  speci-
                                   fies  the destination of the logs. The des-
                                   tination can be any Amazon CloudWatch  Logs
                                   log  group ARN. The destination ARN must be
                                   in the same Amazon Web Services  partition,
                                   Amazon  Web Services Region, and Amazon Web
                                   Services account as your  Amazon  FSx  file
                                   system.

                                          tual machine.

                                      StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                          A Boolean  flag  indicating  whether
                                          this  volume  is the root volume for
                                          its storage virtual  machine  (SVM).
                                          Only one volume on an SVM can be the
                                          root volume. This value defaults  to
                                          false . If this value is true , then
                                          this is the SVM root volume.

                                          This  flag  is  useful  when  you're
                                          deleting  an  SVM,  because you must
                                          first delete all  non-root  volumes.
                                          This flag, when set to false , helps
                                          you identify which volumes to delete
                                          before you can delete the SVM.

                                               system and Snapshot  copies  to
                                               the storage pool tier.

                                             o NONE - keeps a volume's data in
                                               the primary storage tier,  pre-

                                      UUID -> (string)
                                          The  volume's   universally   unique
                                          identifier (UUID).

                                      OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                          Specifies  the type of volume. Valid
                                          values are the following:

                                          o RW specifies a read/write  volume.
                                            RW is the default.

                                          o DP   specifies  a  data-protection
                                            volume. You can  protect  data  by
                                            replicating  it to data-protection
                                            mirror  copies.  If   a   disaster
                                            occurs,    you   can   use   these
                                            data-protection mirror  copies  to
                                            recover data.

                                          o LS specifies a load-sharing mirror
                                            volume.  A   load-sharing   mirror
                                            reduces  the  network traffic to a
                                            FlexVol volume by providing  addi-
                                            tional    read-only    access   to
                                            clients.

                                             A value that specifies the TagKey
                                             ,  the  name of the tag. Tag keys
                                             must be unique for  the  resource
                                             to which they are attached.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             A  value  that specifies the Tag-
                                             Value , the value assigned to the
                                             corresponding tag key. Tag values
                                             can be null and don't have to  be
                                             unique in a tag set. For example,
                                             you can have a key-value pair  in
                                             a tag set of finances : April and
                                             also of payroll : April .

                                          volume. You can't reserve more stor-
                                          age   than  the  parent  volume  has
                                          reserved.

                                      StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                          The maximum  amount  of  storage  in
                                          gibibtyes  (GiB) that the volume can
                                          use from its parent. You can specify
                                          a  quota  larger than the storage on
                                          the parent volume.

                                      DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                          The method used to compress the data
                                          on  the volume. Unless a compression
                                          type is specified,  volumes  inherit
                                          the   DataCompressionType  value  of
                                          their parent volume.

                                          o NONE - Doesn't compress  the  data
                                            on the volume.

                                          o ZSTD  - Compresses the data in the
                                            volume using the Zstandard  (ZSTD)
                                            compression  algorithm. This algo-
                                            rithm reduces the amount of  space
                                            used  on  your volume and has very
                                            little    impact    on     compute
                                            resources.

                                      CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                          A  Boolean  value indicating whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to snapshots. This value defaults to
                                          false . If it's set to  true  ,  all
                                          tags  for  the  volume are copied to
                                          snapshots  where  the  user  doesn't
                                          specify  tags. If this value is true
                                          and you specify one  or  more  tags,
                                          only  the  specified tags are copied
                                          to snapshots. If you specify one  or
                                          more  tags  when  creating the snap-
                                          shot, no tags are  copied  from  the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                      OriginSnapshot -> (structure)

                                             ARN  when  you  need to specify a
                                             resource unambiguously across all
                                             of  Amazon Web Services. For more

                                             data from the snapshot to the new
                                             volume.

                                             o CLONE - The new  volume  refer-

                                               snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is
                                               faster  than  copying  the data
                                               from a snapshot to a new volume
                                               and    doesn't   consume   disk
                                               throughput. However, the origin
                                               snapshot  can't  be  deleted if
                                               there is  a  volume  using  its
                                               copied data.

                                             o FULL_COPY  -  Copies  all  data

                                      ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                          A  Boolean  value indicating whether
                                          the volume is read-only.

                                      NfsExports -> (list)

                               specify  one  or  more tags, only the specified
                               tags are copied to backups. If you specify  one
                               or  more  tags  when  creating a user-initiated
                               backup, no tags are copied from the  file  sys-
                               tem, regardless of this value.

                            CopyTagsToVolumes -> (boolean)

                               value defaults to false . If it's set to true ,
                               all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots
                               where  the  user  doesn't specify tags. If this
                               value is true and you specify one or more tags,
                               only  the  specified  tags  are copied to snap-
                               shots. If you specify one  or  more  tags  when
                               creating  the snapshot, no tags are copied from
                               the volume, regardless of this value.

                               Domain Name System (DNS) name  or  IP  address.
                               You  can create a JunctionPath directly below a
                               parent volume junction or on a directory within
                               a  volume.  A  JunctionPath  for a volume named
                               vol3   might   be    /vol1/vol2/vol3    ,    or
                               /vol1/dir2/vol3 , or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                            SecurityStyle -> (string)
                               The security style for the volume, which can be
                               UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                            SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                               The configured size of the volume, in megabytes
                               (MBs).

                            StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                               The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                            StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                               The ID of the volume's storage virtual machine.

                            StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                               A Boolean flag indicating whether  this  volume
                               is  the  root  volume  for  its storage virtual
                               machine (SVM). Only one volume on an SVM can be
                               the root volume. This value defaults to false .
                               If this value is true , then this  is  the  SVM
                               root volume.

                               This  flag  is  useful  when you're deleting an
                               SVM, because you must first delete all non-root
                               volumes.  This  flag, when set to false , helps
                               you identify which volumes to delete before you
                               can delete the SVM.

                            TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                               The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                               CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                                   Specifies the number of days that user data
                                   in a volume must remain inactive before  it
                                   is  considered  "cold"  and  moved  to  the
                                   capacity pool. Used with the AUTO and SNAP-
                                   SHOT_ONLY  tiering  policies. Enter a whole
                                   number between 2 and  183.  Default  values
                                   are  31  days for AUTO and 2 days for SNAP-
                                   SHOT_ONLY .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   Specifies the tiering policy used to  tran-
                                   sition data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY
                                   .

                                   o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold  snapshots  to
                                     the capacity pool storage tier.

                                   o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots
                                     to the capacity pool storage  tier  based
                                     on your access patterns.

                                   o ALL  - moves all user data blocks in both
                                     the  active  file  system  and   Snapshot
                                     copies to the storage pool tier.

                                   o NONE  - keeps a volume's data in the pri-
                                     mary storage  tier,  preventing  it  from
                                     being moved to the capacity pool tier.

                            UUID -> (string)
                               The   volume's  universally  unique  identifier
                               (UUID).

                            OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                               Specifies the type of volume. Valid values  are
                               the following:

                               o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW is the
                                 default.

                               o DP specifies a  data-protection  volume.  You
                                 can   protect   data  by  replicating  it  to
                                 data-protection mirror copies. If a  disaster
                                 occurs,  you  can  use  these data-protection
                                 mirror copies to recover data.

                               o LS specifies a load-sharing mirror volume.  A
                                 load-sharing mirror reduces the network traf-
                                 fic to a FlexVol volume  by  providing  addi-
                                 tional read-only access to clients.

                        ResourceARN -> (string)

                            resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon  Web  Ser-
                            vices  resources.  We require an ARN when you need
                            to specify a resource unambiguously across all  of
                            Amazon  Web  Services.  For  more information, see
                            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  in  the  Amazon  Web

                               Key -> (string)
                                   A  value  that  specifies  the TagKey , the
                                   name of the tag. Tag keys  must  be  unique
                                   for   the   resource   to  which  they  are
                                   attached.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   A value that specifies the TagValue  ,  the

                                   key. Tag values can be null and don't  have
                                   to be unique in a tag set. For example, you
                                   can have a key-value pair in a tag  set  of
                                   finances  :  April  and  also  of payroll :
                                   April .

                                      For  FSx  for  Lustre  file systems, and
                                      Single-AZ Windows file systems, this  is
                                      the  ID  of the subnet that contains the
                                      file system's endpoint.  For  MULTI_AZ_1
                                      Windows and ONTAP file systems, the file
                                      system endpoint is available in the Pre-
                                      ferredSubnetID .

                                          the  Amazon FSx file system. Aliases
                                          allow you to use existing DNS  names
                                          to  access  the  data in your Amazon
                                          FSx file system. You  can  associate
                                          up  to 50 aliases with a file system
                                          at any time. You can associate addi-
                                          tional  DNS aliases after you create
                                          the file system using the Associate-
                                          FileSystemAliases operation. You can
                                          remove DNS  aliases  from  the  file
                                          system after it is created using the
                                          DisassociateFileSystemAliases opera-
                                          tion.  You  only need to specify the
                                          alias name in the  request  payload.

                                          user  doesn't  specify  any tags. If
                                          this value is true, and you  specify
                                          one or more tags, only the specified
                                          tags are copied to backups.  If  you

                                          visioned  with  HDD storage devices.
                                          This  parameter  is  required   when
                                          StorageType is HDD. When set to READ
                                          the file system has an  SSD  storage
                                          cache  that  is  sized to 20% of the
                                          file system's storage capacity. This
                                          improves  the  performance  for fre-
                                          quently accessed files by caching up
                                          to  20%  of the total storage capac-
                                          ity.

                                          This  parameter  is  required   when
                                          StorageType is set to HDD.

                                          true , all tags on the  file  system
                                          are  copied to all automatic backups

                                          specify tags. If this value is  true
                                          and  you  specify  one or more tags,
                                          only the specified tags  are  copied
                                          to  snapshots. If you specify one or

                                      StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the volume's storage  vir-
                                          tual machine.

                                      StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                          A  Boolean  flag  indicating whether
                                          this volume is the root  volume  for
                                          its  storage  virtual machine (SVM).
                                          Only one volume on an SVM can be the
                                          root  volume. This value defaults to
                                          false . If this value is true , then
                                          this is the SVM root volume.

                                          This  flag  is  useful  when  you're
                                          deleting an SVM,  because  you  must
                                          first  delete  all non-root volumes.
                                          This flag, when set to false , helps
                                          you identify which volumes to delete
                                          before you can delete the SVM.

                                               access patterns.

                                             o ALL   -  moves  all  user  data
                                               blocks in both the active  file
                                               system  and  Snapshot copies to
                                               the storage pool tier.

                                             o NONE - keeps a volume's data in
                                               the  primary storage tier, pre-
                                               venting it from being moved  to

                                             , the name of the tag.  Tag  keys
                                             must  be  unique for the resource
                                             to which they are attached.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             A value that specifies  the  Tag-
                                             Value , the value assigned to the
                                             corresponding tag key. Tag values
                                             can  be null and don't have to be
                                             unique in a tag set. For example,
                                             you  can have a key-value pair in
                                             a tag set of finances : April and
                                             also of payroll : April .

                                          volume. You can't reserve more stor-
                                          age  than  the  parent  volume   has
                                          reserved.

                                      StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                          The  maximum  amount  of  storage in
                                          gibibtyes (GiB) that the volume  can
                                          use from its parent. You can specify
                                          a quota larger than the  storage  on
                                          the parent volume.

                                      DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                          The method used to compress the data
                                          on the volume. Unless a  compression
                                          type  is  specified, volumes inherit
                                          the  DataCompressionType  value   of
                                          their parent volume.

                                          o NONE  -  Doesn't compress the data
                                            on the volume.

                                          o ZSTD - Compresses the data in  the
                                            volume  using the Zstandard (ZSTD)
                                            compression algorithm. This  algo-
                                            rithm  reduces the amount of space
                                            used on your volume and  has  very
                                            little     impact    on    compute
                                            resources.

                                      CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                          A Boolean value  indicating  whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to snapshots. This value defaults to
                                          false  .  If  it's set to true , all
                                          tags for the volume  are  copied  to
                                          snapshots  where  the  user  doesn't
                                          specify tags. If this value is  true
                                          and  you  specify  one or more tags,
                                          only the specified tags  are  copied
                                          to  snapshots. If you specify one or
                                          more tags when  creating  the  snap-
                                          shot,  no  tags  are copied from the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                      OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                          The configuration object that speci-

                                          gin of the data for the volume.

                                          SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)
                                             for   a   given   resource.  ARNs
                                             uniquely identify Amazon Web Ser-

                                          CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                             The  strategy  used  when copying
                                             data from the snapshot to the new
                                             volume.

                                             o CLONE  -  The new volume refer-
                                               ences the data  in  the  origin
                                               snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is
                                               faster than  copying  the  data
                                               from a snapshot to a new volume
                                               and   doesn't   consume    disk
                                               throughput. However, the origin
                                               snapshot can't  be  deleted  if
                                               there  is  a  volume  using its
                                               copied data.

                                             o FULL_COPY  -  Copies  all  data
                                               from  the  snapshot  to the new
                                               volume.

                                      ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                          A Boolean value  indicating  whether
                                          the volume is read-only.

                                      is of.

                                   CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                                      The time that the resource was  created,
                                      in seconds (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z),
                                      also known as Unix time.

                                   Lifecycle -> (string)
                                      The lifecycle status of the snapshot.

                                      o PENDING - Amazon  FSx  hasn't  started
                                        creating the snapshot.

                                      o CREATING  - Amazon FSx is creating the
                                        snapshot.

                                      o DELETING - Amazon FSx is deleting  the
                                        snapshot.

                                      o AVAILABLE  -  The  snapshot  is  fully
                                        available.

                                   Tags -> (list)

                                      50 elements.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies  a  key-value  pair  for a
                                          resource tag.

                                          Key -> (string)
                                             A value that specifies the TagKey
                                             ,  the  name of the tag. Tag keys
                                             must be unique for  the  resource
                                             to which they are attached.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             A  value  that specifies the Tag-
                                             Value , the value assigned to the
                                             corresponding tag key. Tag values
                                             can be null and don't have to  be
                                             unique in a tag set. For example,
                                             you can have a key-value pair  in
                                             a tag set of finances : April and
                                             also of payroll : April .

                        OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)

                            volume.

                            ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                               The ID of the parent volume.

                            VolumePath -> (string)
                               The  path  to  the volume from the root volume.
                               For example, fsx/parentVolume/volume1 .

                            StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                               The amount of storage  in  gibibytes  (GiB)  to
                               reserve  from  the  parent  volume.  You  can't
                               reserve more storage than the parent volume has
                               reserved.

                            StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                               The  maximum  amount  of  storage  in gibibtyes
                               (GiB) that the volume can use from its  parent.
                               You can specify a quota larger than the storage
                               on the parent volume.

                            DataCompressionType -> (string)
                               The method used to compress  the  data  on  the
                               volume. Unless a compression type is specified,
                               volumes inherit the  DataCompressionType  value
                               of their parent volume.

                               o NONE  - Doesn't compress the data on the vol-
                                 ume.

                               o ZSTD - Compresses  the  data  in  the  volume
                                 using  the Zstandard (ZSTD) compression algo-
                                 rithm. This algorithm reduces the  amount  of
                                 space used on your volume and has very little
                                 impact on compute resources.

                            CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                               A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the
                               volume  should  be  copied  to  snapshots. This
                               value defaults to false . If it's set to true ,
                               all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots
                               where the user doesn't specify  tags.  If  this
                               value is true and you specify one or more tags,
                               only the specified tags  are  copied  to  snap-
                               shots.  If  you  specify  one or more tags when
                               creating the snapshot, no tags are copied  from
                               the volume, regardless of this value.

                            OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  object  that  specifies the
                               snapshot to use as the origin of the  data  for
                               the volume.

                               SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given
                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services  resources. We require an ARN when
                                   you need to specify  a  resource  unambigu-
                                   ously  across  all  of Amazon Web Services.
                                   For more information, see  Amazon  Resource
                                   Names  (ARNs)  in  the  Amazon Web Services

                               CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                   The strategy used when  copying  data  from
                                   the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   o CLONE  -  The  new  volume references the
                                     data in the origin  snapshot.  Cloning  a
                                     snapshot  is faster than copying the data
                                     from a  snapshot  to  a  new  volume  and
                                     doesn't consume disk throughput. However,
                                     the origin snapshot can't be  deleted  if
                                     there  is a volume using its copied data.

                                   o FULL_COPY -  Copies  all  data  from  the
                                     snapshot to the new volume.

                            ReadOnly -> (boolean)

                                      For  FSx  for  Lustre  file systems, and
                                      Single-AZ Windows file systems, this  is
                                      the  ID  of the subnet that contains the
                                      file system's endpoint.  For  MULTI_AZ_1
                                      Windows and ONTAP file systems, the file
                                      system endpoint is available in the Pre-
                                      ferredSubnetID .

                                          that are currently  associated  with
                                          the  Amazon FSx file system. Aliases
                                          allow you to use existing DNS  names
                                          to  access  the  data in your Amazon
                                          FSx file system. You  can  associate
                                          up  to 50 aliases with a file system
                                          at any time. You can associate addi-
                                          tional  DNS aliases after you create
                                          the file system using the Associate-
                                          FileSystemAliases operation. You can
                                          remove DNS  aliases  from  the  file

                                          mounting the file system.

                                          For  the  SCRATCH_1 deployment type,
                                          this value is  always  "fsx  ".  For
                                          SCRATCH_2  , PERSISTENT_1 , and PER-
                                          SISTENT_2  deployment  types,   this
                                          value  is  a  string  that is unique
                                          within  an   Amazon   Web   Services
                                          Region.

                                      DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime         ->
                                      (string)
                                          A recurring daily time, in the  for-
                                          mat  HH:MM  .  HH is the zero-padded
                                          hour of the day (0-23),  and  MM  is
                                          the  zero-padded minute of the hour.
                                          For example, 05:00  specifies  5  AM
                                          daily.

                                      AutomaticBackupRetentionDays  ->  (inte-
                                      ger)

                                          matic backups. Setting this property
                                          to 0 disables automatic backups. You
                                          can  retain  automatic backups for a
                                          maximum of 90 days. The default is 0
                                          .

                                      CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                          A  boolean  flag  indicating whether
                                          tags on the file system  are  copied
                                          to backups. If it's set to true, all
                                          tags on the file system  are  copied
                                          to  all  automatic  backups  and any
                                          user-initiated  backups  where   the
                                          user  doesn't  specify  any tags. If
                                          this value is true, and you  specify
                                          one or more tags, only the specified
                                          tags are copied to backups.  If  you
                                          specify one or more tags when creat-
                                          ing a user-initiated backup, no tags
                                          are  copied  from  the  file system,
                                          regardless of this value. (Default =
                                          false)

                                      DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                          The type of drive cache used by PER-
                                          SISTENT_1 file systems that are pro-
                                          visioned  with  HDD storage devices.
                                          This  parameter  is  required   when
                                          StorageType is HDD. When set to READ
                                          the file system has an  SSD  storage
                                          cache  that  is  sized to 20% of the
                                          file system's storage capacity. This
                                          improves  the  performance  for fre-
                                          quently accessed files by caching up
                                          to  20%  of the total storage capac-
                                          ity.

                                          This  parameter  is  required   when
                                          StorageType is set to HDD.

                                          sionType can have the following val-
                                          ues:

                                          o NONE - Data compression is  turned
                                            off for the file system.

                                          o LZ4  -  Data compression is turned
                                            on with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                          true , all tags on the  file  system
                                          are  copied to all automatic backups

                                          specify tags. If this value is  true
                                          and  you  specify  one or more tags,
                                          only the specified tags  are  copied
                                          to  snapshots. If you specify one or

                                      StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the volume's storage  vir-
                                          tual machine.

                                      StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                          A  Boolean  flag  indicating whether
                                          this volume is the root  volume  for
                                          its  storage  virtual machine (SVM).
                                          Only one volume on an SVM can be the
                                          root  volume. This value defaults to
                                          false . If this value is true , then
                                          this is the SVM root volume.

                                          This  flag  is  useful  when  you're
                                          deleting an SVM,  because  you  must
                                          first  delete  all non-root volumes.
                                          This flag, when set to false , helps
                                          you identify which volumes to delete
                                          before you can delete the SVM.

                                               access patterns.

                                             o ALL   -  moves  all  user  data
                                               blocks in both the active  file
                                               system  and  Snapshot copies to
                                               the storage pool tier.

                                             o NONE - keeps a volume's data in
                                               the  primary storage tier, pre-
                                               venting it from being moved  to

                                             A value that specifies the TagKey
                                             , the name of the tag.  Tag  keys
                                             must  be  unique for the resource
                                             to which they are attached.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             A value that specifies  the  Tag-
                                             Value , the value assigned to the
                                             corresponding tag key. Tag values
                                             can  be null and don't have to be
                                             unique in a tag set. For example,
                                             you  can have a key-value pair in
                                             a tag set of finances : April and
                                             also of payroll : April .

                                          volume. You can't reserve more stor-
                                          age  than  the  parent  volume   has
                                          reserved.

                                      StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                          The  maximum  amount  of  storage in
                                          gibibtyes (GiB) that the volume  can
                                          use from its parent. You can specify
                                          a quota larger than the  storage  on
                                          the parent volume.

                                      DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                          The method used to compress the data
                                          on the volume. Unless a  compression
                                          type  is  specified, volumes inherit
                                          the  DataCompressionType  value   of
                                          their parent volume.

                                          o NONE  -  Doesn't compress the data
                                            on the volume.

                                          o ZSTD - Compresses the data in  the
                                            volume  using the Zstandard (ZSTD)
                                            compression algorithm. This  algo-
                                            rithm  reduces the amount of space
                                            used on your volume and  has  very
                                            little     impact    on    compute
                                            resources.

                                      CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                          A Boolean value  indicating  whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to snapshots. This value defaults to
                                          false  .  If  it's set to true , all
                                          tags for the volume  are  copied  to
                                          snapshots  where  the  user  doesn't
                                          specify tags. If this value is  true
                                          and  you  specify  one or more tags,
                                          only the specified tags  are  copied
                                          to  snapshots. If you specify one or
                                          more tags when  creating  the  snap-
                                          shot,  no  tags  are copied from the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                      OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                          The configuration object that speci-

                                          gin of the data for the volume.

                                          SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)
                                             for   a   given   resource.  ARNs
                                             uniquely identify Amazon Web Ser-

                                             ARN when you need  to  specify  a

                                             of Amazon Web Services. For  more

                                          CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                             The  strategy  used  when copying
                                             data from the snapshot to the new
                                             volume.

                                             o CLONE  -  The new volume refer-
                                               ences the data  in  the  origin
                                               snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is
                                               faster than  copying  the  data
                                               from a snapshot to a new volume
                                               and   doesn't   consume    disk
                                               throughput. However, the origin
                                               snapshot can't  be  deleted  if
                                               there  is  a  volume  using its
                                               copied data.

                                             o FULL_COPY  -  Copies  all  data
                                               from  the  snapshot  to the new
                                               volume.

                                      ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                          A Boolean value  indicating  whether
                                          the volume is read-only.

                     retain automatic backups for a maximum of  90  days.  The
                     default is 0 .

                 CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                     A  Boolean value indicating whether tags on the file sys-
                     tem should be copied to backups. If it's set  to  true  ,
                     all  tags  on the file system are copied to all automatic
                     backups and any user-initiated  backups  where  the  user
                     doesn't  specify  any tags. If this value is true and you
                     specify one or more tags, only  the  specified  tags  are
                     copied  to  backups. If you specify one or more tags when
                     creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from
                     the file system, regardless of this value.

                 CopyTagsToVolumes -> (boolean)
                     A  Boolean  value  indicating whether tags for the volume
                     should be copied to snapshots.  This  value  defaults  to
                     false . If it's set to true , all tags for the volume are
                     copied to snapshots where the user doesn't specify  tags.
                     If  this  value is true and you specify one or more tags,
                     only the specified tags are copied to snapshots.  If  you
                     specify  one  or more tags when creating the snapshot, no
                     tags are copied  from  the  volume,  regardless  of  this
                     value.

                 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                     A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                        D  is the day of the week, for which 1 represents Mon-
                        day and 7 represents Sunday. For further details,  see
                        the ISO-8601 spec as described on Wikipedia .

                        HH  is  the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM
                        is the zero-padded minute of the hour.

                     For example, 1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5  AM  Mon-
                     day.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                 uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.  We  require
                 an  ARN  when  you  need  to specify a resource unambiguously
                 across all of Amazon Web Services. For more information,  see
                 Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services Gen-
                 eral Reference .

          OwnerId -> (string)
              An Amazon Web Services account ID. This ID is a 12-digit  number

                 FlexCacheEndpointType -> (string)
                     Specifies the FlexCache  endpoint  type  of  the  volume.
                     Valid values are the following:

                     o NONE specifies that the volume doesn't have a FlexCache
                       configuration. NONE is the default.

                     o ORIGIN specifies that the volume is the  origin  volume
                       for a FlexCache volume.

                     o CACHE  specifies that the volume is a FlexCache volume.

                 JunctionPath -> (string)
                     Specifies the  directory  that  network-attached  storage
                     (NAS)  clients  use  to  mount the volume, along with the
                     storage virtual machine (SVM) Domain  Name  System  (DNS)
                     name  or  IP  address.  You  can  create  a  JunctionPath
                     directly below a parent volume junction or on a directory
                     within  a  volume. A JunctionPath for a volume named vol3
                     might be /vol1/vol2/vol3 , or /vol1/dir2/vol3 ,  or  even
                     /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                 SecurityStyle -> (string)
                     The  security  style  for the volume, which can be UNIX ,

                     The ID of the volume's storage virtual machine.

                 StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                     A Boolean flag indicating whether this volume is the root
                     volume  for  its  storage virtual machine (SVM). Only one
                     volume on an SVM can  be  the  root  volume.  This  value
                     defaults  to false . If this value is true , then this is
                     the SVM root volume.

                     This flag is useful when you're deleting an SVM,  because
                     you  must  first  delete all non-root volumes. This flag,
                     when set to false , helps you identify which  volumes  to
                     delete before you can delete the SVM.

                 TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                     The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                        ume must  remain  inactive  before  it  is  considered
                        "cold"  and  moved to the capacity pool. Used with the
                        AUTO and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering policies. Enter a whole
                        number  between  2 and 183. Default values are 31 days
                        for AUTO and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                     Name -> (string)
                        Specifies the tiering policy used to transition  data.
                        Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                        o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots to the capacity
                          pool storage tier.

                        o AUTO - moves cold user data  and  snapshots  to  the
                          capacity pool storage tier based on your access pat-
                          terns.

                        o ALL - moves all user data blocks in both the  active
                          file  system and Snapshot copies to the storage pool
                          tier.

                        o NONE - keeps a volume's data in the primary  storage
                          tier, preventing it from being moved to the capacity
                          pool tier.

                 UUID -> (string)
                     The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

                 OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                     Specifies the type of volume. Valid values are  the  fol-
                     lowing:

                     o RW specifies a read/write volume. RW is the default.

                     o DP  specifies a data-protection volume. You can protect
                       data  by  replicating  it  to  data-protection   mirror
                       copies.  If  a  disaster  occurs,  you  can  use  these
                       data-protection mirror copies to recover data.

                     o LS specifies a load-sharing mirror volume. A load-shar-
                       ing  mirror  reduces  the  network traffic to a FlexVol
                       volume by  providing  additional  read-only  access  to
                       clients.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                 uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.  We  require
                 an  ARN  when  you  need  to specify a resource unambiguously
                 across all of Amazon Web Services. For more information,  see
                 Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services Gen-
                 eral Reference .

                        A value that specifies the TagKey , the  name  of  the
                        tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which
                        they are attached.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A value  that  specifies  the  TagValue  ,  the  value
                        assigned  to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can
                        be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set.  For
                        example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of
                        finances : April and also of payroll : April .

              VolumeId -> (string)

                 in process or waiting to be processed. Administrative actions
                 describe changes to the Amazon FSx system that you initiated.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for
                     the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file system.

                     AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                        Describes the type of administrative action,  as  fol-
                        lows:

                        o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  -  A file system update adminis-
                          trative action initiated from the  Amazon  FSx  con-
                          sole,    API    (UpdateFileSystem    ),    or    CLI
                          (update-file-system ).

                        o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION - After the  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                          task  to  increase  a file system's storage capacity
                          has been completed successfully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZA-
                          TION task starts.

                          o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization is the
                            process of migrating the file system data to newer
                            larger disks.

                          o For   Lustre,  storage  optimization  consists  of
                            rebalancing the data across the existing and newly
                            added file servers.

                        You  can track the storage-optimization progress using
                        the ProgressPercent property.  When  STORAGE_OPTIMIZA-
                        TION  has  been  completed  successfully,  the  parent
                        FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE action status changes to  COMPLETED
                        .  For more information, see Managing storage capacity
                        in the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide ,

                            RemoteAdministrationEndpoint -> (string)
                               For  MULTI_AZ_1 deployment types, use this end-
                               point when performing administrative  tasks  on
                               the  file system using Amazon FSx Remote Power-
                               Shell.

                               For  SINGLE_AZ_1  and  SINGLE_AZ_2   deployment
                               types, this is the DNS name of the file system.

                               This endpoint is temporarily  unavailable  when
                               the file system is undergoing maintenance.

                            PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
                               For  MULTI_AZ_1  deployment types, it specifies
                               the ID of the subnet where the  preferred  file
                               server  is located. Must be one of the two sub-
                               net IDs specified in SubnetIds property. Amazon
                               FSx  serves  traffic from this subnet except in
                               the event of a failover to the  secondary  file
                               server.

                               For   SINGLE_AZ_1  and  SINGLE_AZ_2  deployment
                               types, this value is the same as that for  Sub-
                               netIDs . For more information, see Availability

                               measured in megabytes per second.

                            MaintenanceOperationsInProgress -> (list)
                               The  list of maintenance operations in progress
                               for this file system.

                               (string)
                                   An  enumeration  specifying  the  currently
                                   ongoing maintenance operation.

                            WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)

                            AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                               The number of days to retain automatic backups.
                               Setting  this  to 0 disables automatic backups.
                               You can retain automatic backups for a  maximum
                               of 90 days.

                            CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                               A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags on the
                               file system should be copied to  backups.  This
                               value  defaults  to false. If it's set to true,
                               all tags on the file system are copied  to  all
                               automatic  backups and any user-initiated back-
                               ups where the user doesn't specify any tags. If
                               this value is true, and you specify one or more
                               tags, only the specified  tags  are  copied  to
                               backups.  If  you specify one or more tags when
                               creating a user-initiated backup, no  tags  are
                               copied from the file system, regardless of this
                               value.

                            Aliases -> (list)

                               currently  associated  with the Amazon FSx file
                               system. Aliases allow you to use  existing  DNS
                               names  to  access  the  data in your Amazon FSx
                               file system. You can associate up to 50 aliases
                               with  a  file system at any time. You can asso-
                               ciate additional DNS aliases after  you  create
                               the  file  system  using  the AssociateFileSys-
                               temAliases  operation.  You  can   remove   DNS
                               aliases  from  the file system after it is cre-
                               ated  using  the  DisassociateFileSystemAliases
                               operation.  You  only need to specify the alias
                               name in the request payload. For more  informa-
                               tion, see DNS aliases .

                                   A  DNS  alias  that  is associated with the
                                   file system. You can use  a  DNS  alias  to
                                   access a file system using user-defined DNS
                                   names, in addition to the default DNS  name
                                   that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system.
                                   For more information, see  DNS  aliases  in

                                      (a-z), regardless  of  how  you  specify
                                      them:  as  uppercase  letters, lowercase
                                      letters, or the corresponding letters in
                                      escape codes.

                                        ated with an Amazon FSx file system.

                                      o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating  the
                                        DNS  alias and associating it with the
                                        file system.

                                      o CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was  unable
                                        to  associate  the  DNS alias with the
                                        file system.

                                      o DELETING - Amazon FSx is  disassociat-
                                        ing the DNS alias from the file system

                                   Describes the state of the file system's S3
                                   durable data repository, if it  is  config-
                                   ured  with  an S3 repository. The lifecycle
                                   can have the following values:

                                   o CREATING - The data repository configura-
                                     tion  between the FSx file system and the
                                     linked S3 data repository is  being  cre-
                                     ated. The data repository is unavailable.

                                   o AVAILABLE - The data repository is avail-
                                     able for use.

                                   o MISCONFIGURED  -  Amazon FSx cannot auto-
                                     matically  import  updates  from  the  S3
                                     bucket until the data repository configu-
                                     ration is corrected.  For  more  informa-
                                     tion, see Troubleshooting a Misconfigured
                                     linked S3 bucket .

                                   o UPDATING - The data repository is  under-
                                     going  a  customer  initiated  update and
                                     availability may be impacted.

                                   o FAILED - The data repository is in a ter-
                                     minal state that cannot be recovered.

                               ImportPath -> (string)
                                   The  import  path  to  the Amazon S3 bucket
                                   (and optional prefix) that you're using  as
                                   the data repository for your FSx for Lustre
                                   file       system,       for        example
                                   s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix  .  If a
                                   prefix is specified  after  the  Amazon  S3
                                   bucket  name,  only  object  keys with that
                                   prefix are loaded into the file system.

                               ExportPath -> (string)
                                   The export path to  the  Amazon  S3  bucket

                                   new and changed Lustre file system files in
                                   S3.

                               ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                                   For  files imported from a data repository,
                                   this value determines the stripe count  and
                                   maximum  amount  of  data per file (in MiB)
                                   stored on a single physical disk. The maxi-
                                   mum  number of disks that a single file can
                                   be striped across is limited by  the  total
                                   number  of disks that make up the file sys-
                                   tem.

                                   The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB)
                                   and  can  go  as  high  as 512,000 MiB (500
                                   GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size
                                   of 5 TB.

                               AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                                   Describes  the file system's linked S3 data
                                   repository's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoIm-
                                   portPolicy  configures how Amazon FSx keeps
                                   your file and directory listings up to date
                                   as you add or modify objects in your linked
                                   S3 bucket. AutoImportPolicy  can  have  the
                                   following values:

                                   o NONE  - (Default) AutoImport is off. Ama-
                                     zon FSx only updates file  and  directory
                                     listings  from  the linked S3 bucket when
                                     the file system is created. FSx does  not
                                     update  file  and  directory listings for
                                     any new or changed objects after choosing
                                     this option.

                                   o NEW  - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx auto-
                                     matically imports directory  listings  of
                                     any  new  objects  added to the linked S3
                                     bucket that do not currently exist in the
                                     FSx file system.

                                   o NEW_CHANGED  -  AutoImport  is on. Amazon
                                     FSx automatically imports file and direc-
                                     tory listings of any new objects added to
                                     the S3 bucket and  any  existing  objects
                                     that  are  changed in the S3 bucket after
                                     you choose this option.

                                   o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport  is  on.
                                     Amazon FSx automatically imports file and
                                     directory listings  of  any  new  objects
                                     added  to  the  S3  bucket,  any existing
                                     objects  that  are  changed  in  the   S3
                                     bucket, and any objects that were deleted
                                     in the S3 bucket.

                               FailureDetails -> (structure)
                                   Provides  detailed  information  about  the
                                   data respository if its Lifecycle is set to
                                   MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                                   Message -> (string)
                                      A detailed error message.

                            DeploymentType -> (string)
                               The deployment type of the FSx for Lustre  file
                               system. Scratch deployment type is designed for
                               temporary storage and  shorter-term  processing
                               of data.
                                   SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2  deployment types
                                   are best suited for when you need temporary
                                   storage   and  shorter-term  processing  of
                                   data. The SCRATCH_2  deployment  type  pro-
                                   vides  in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                   higher  burst  throughput   capacity   than
                                   SCRATCH_1 .

                               The  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                               type is used for longer-term storage and  work-
                               loads  and  encryption of data in transit. PER-
                               SISTENT_2 is built on Lustre v2.12  and  offers
                               higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up  to  1000
                               MB/s/TiB) along with a  lower  minimum  storage
                               capacity  requirement  (600 GiB). To learn more
                               about FSx for Lustre deployment types, see  FSx
                               for Lustre deployment options .

                               The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                            PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                               Per  unit  storage  throughput  represents  the
                               megabytes per second of read or write  through-
                               put per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File
                               system throughput capacity is equal to  Storage
                               capacity   (TiB)   *   PerUnitStorageThroughput
                               (MB/s/TiB). This option is only valid for  PER-
                               SISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types.

                               Valid values:

                               o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                               o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                               o For  PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500,
                                 1000.

                            MountName -> (string)
                               You use the MountName value when  mounting  the
                               file system.

                               For  the  SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value
                               is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 ,  PERSISTENT_1
                               , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types, this value
                               is a string that is unique within an Amazon Web
                               Services Region.

                            DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                               A  recurring  daily time, in the format HH:MM .
                               HH is the zero-padded hour of the  day  (0-23),
                               and  MM  is the zero-padded minute of the hour.
                               For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                            AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                               The number of days to retain automatic backups.
                               Setting  this  property to 0 disables automatic
                               backups. You can retain automatic backups for a
                               maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

                            CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                               A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags on the
                               file system are copied to backups. If it's  set
                               to true, all tags on the file system are copied
                               to all automatic backups and any user-initiated
                               backups  where  the  user  doesn't  specify any
                               tags. If this value is true,  and  you  specify
                               one  or  more tags, only the specified tags are
                               copied to backups. If you specify one  or  more
                               tags  when creating a user-initiated backup, no
                               tags are copied from the file  system,  regard-
                               less of this value. (Default = false)

                            DriveCacheType -> (string)
                               The  type  of  drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1

                               storage  devices.  This  parameter  is required
                               when StorageType is HDD. When set to  READ  the
                               file  system  has  an SSD storage cache that is
                               sized to  20%  of  the  file  system's  storage
                               capacity.  This  improves  the  performance for
                               frequently accessed files by caching up to  20%
                               of the total storage capacity.

                               This  parameter is required when StorageType is
                               set to HDD.

                                          the  user  doesn't specify any tags.
                                          If this value is true, and you spec-
                                          ify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                          ified tags are copied to backups. If
                                          you  specify  one  or more tags when
                                          creating a user-initiated backup, no
                                          tags  are  copied from the file sys-

                                          copied to backups. If  it's  set  to
                                          true  ,  all tags on the file system
                                          are copied to all automatic  backups
                                          and any user-initiated backups where
                                          the user doesn't specify  any  tags.
                                          If  this value is true and you spec-

                                          ified tags are copied to backups. If
                                          you specify one or  more  tags  when
                                          creating a user-initiated backup, no
                                          tags are copied from the  file  sys-
                                          tem, regardless of this value.

                                          false . If it's set to  true  ,  all
                                          tags  for  the  volume are copied to
                                          snapshots  where  the  user  doesn't
                                          specify  tags. If this value is true
                                          and you specify one  or  more  tags,
                                          only  the  specified tags are copied
                                          to snapshots. If you specify one  or

                                          shot, no tags are  copied  from  the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                      SecurityStyle -> (string)
                                          The  security  style for the volume,
                                          which can be UNIX , NTFS , or  MIXED
                                          .

                                      SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                          The  configured  size of the volume,
                                          in megabytes (MBs).

                                      StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)

                                      StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                          The  ID of the volume's storage vir-
                                          tual machine.

                                      StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                          A Boolean  flag  indicating  whether
                                          this  volume  is the root volume for
                                          its storage virtual  machine  (SVM).
                                          Only one volume on an SVM can be the
                                          root volume. This value defaults  to
                                          false . If this value is true , then
                                          this is the SVM root volume.

                                          This  flag  is  useful  when  you're
                                          deleting  an  SVM,  because you must
                                          first delete all  non-root  volumes.
                                          This flag, when set to false , helps
                                          you identify which volumes to delete
                                          before you can delete the SVM.

                                          on  the volume. Unless a compression
                                          type is specified,  volumes  inherit
                                          the   DataCompressionType  value  of
                                          their parent volume.

                                      CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                          A  Boolean  value indicating whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to snapshots. This value defaults to
                                          false . If it's set to  true  ,  all
                                          tags  for  the  volume are copied to

                                          specify  tags. If this value is true
                                          and you specify one  or  more  tags,
                                          only  the  specified tags are copied
                                          to snapshots. If you specify one  or
                                          more  tags  when  creating the snap-
                                          shot, no tags are  copied  from  the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                               snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is
                                               faster  than  copying  the data
                                               from a snapshot to a new volume

                               all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots
                               where  the  user  doesn't specify tags. If this
                               value is true and you specify one or more tags,
                               only  the  specified  tags  are copied to snap-

                               o NONE specifies that the volume doesn't have a
                                 FlexCache configuration. NONE is the default.

                               o ORIGIN  specifies that the volume is the ori-
                                 gin volume for a FlexCache volume.

                               o CACHE specifies that the volume  is  a  Flex-

                               Domain Name System (DNS) name  or  IP  address.
                               You  can create a JunctionPath directly below a
                               parent volume junction or on a directory within
                               a  volume.  A  JunctionPath  for a volume named
                               vol3   might   be    /vol1/vol2/vol3    ,    or
                               /vol1/dir2/vol3 , or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                            SecurityStyle -> (string)

                            StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                               A Boolean flag indicating whether  this  volume
                               is  the  root  volume  for  its storage virtual
                               machine (SVM). Only one volume on an SVM can be
                               the root volume. This value defaults to false .
                               If this value is true , then this  is  the  SVM
                               root volume.

                               This  flag  is  useful  when you're deleting an
                               SVM, because you must first delete all non-root
                               volumes.  This  flag, when set to false , helps
                               you identify which volumes to delete before you
                               can delete the SVM.

                            TieringPolicy -> (structure)

                                   Specifies the number of days that user data
                                   in a volume must remain inactive before  it
                                   is  considered  "cold"  and  moved  to  the
                                   capacity pool. Used with the AUTO and SNAP-
                                   SHOT_ONLY  tiering  policies. Enter a whole
                                   number between 2 and  183.  Default  values
                                   are  31  days for AUTO and 2 days for SNAP-
                                   SHOT_ONLY .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   Specifies the tiering policy used to  tran-
                                   sition data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY
                                   .

                                   o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold  snapshots  to
                                     the capacity pool storage tier.

                                   o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots
                                     to the capacity pool storage  tier  based
                                     on your access patterns.

                                   o ALL  - moves all user data blocks in both
                                     the  active  file  system  and   Snapshot
                                     copies to the storage pool tier.

                                   o NONE  - keeps a volume's data in the pri-
                                     mary storage  tier,  preventing  it  from
                                     being moved to the capacity pool tier.

                            UUID -> (string)

                               o DP specifies a  data-protection  volume.  You
                                 can   protect   data  by  replicating  it  to
                                 data-protection mirror copies. If a  disaster
                                 occurs,  you  can  use  these data-protection
                                 mirror copies to recover data.

                               o LS specifies a load-sharing mirror volume.  A
                                 load-sharing mirror reduces the network traf-
                                 fic to a FlexVol volume  by  providing  addi-
                                 tional read-only access to clients.

                        ResourceARN -> (string)

                            resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon  Web  Ser-
                            vices  resources.  We require an ARN when you need
                            to specify a resource unambiguously across all  of
                            Amazon  Web  Services.  For  more information, see
                            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  in  the  Amazon  Web

                                   name of the tag. Tag keys  must  be  unique
                                   for   the   resource   to  which  they  are
                                   attached.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   A value that specifies the TagValue  ,  the
                                   value  assigned  to  the  corresponding tag
                                   key. Tag values can be null and don't  have
                                   to be unique in a tag set. For example, you
                                   can have a key-value pair in a tag  set  of
                                   finances  :  April  and  also  of payroll :
                                   April .

                                          to backups. If it's set to true, all
                                          tags on the file system  are  copied
                                          to  all  automatic  backups  and any

                                          this value is true, and you  specify
                                          one or more tags, only the specified
                                          tags are copied to backups.  If  you

                                          file system's storage capacity. This
                                          improves  the  performance  for fre-

                                          ity.

                                          This  parameter  is  required   when
                                          StorageType is set to HDD.

                               on the parent volume.

                            DataCompressionType -> (string)
                               The  method  used  to  compress the data on the
                               volume. Unless a compression type is specified,
                               volumes  inherit  the DataCompressionType value
                               of their parent volume.

                               o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the  vol-
                                 ume.

                               o ZSTD  -  Compresses  the  data  in the volume
                                 using the Zstandard (ZSTD) compression  algo-
                                 rithm.  This  algorithm reduces the amount of
                                 space used on your volume and has very little
                                 impact on compute resources.

                            CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                               A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the
                               volume should  be  copied  to  snapshots.  This
                               value defaults to false . If it's set to true ,
                               all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots
                               where  the  user  doesn't specify tags. If this
                               value is true and you specify one or more tags,
                               only  the  specified  tags  are copied to snap-
                               shots. If you specify one  or  more  tags  when
                               creating  the snapshot, no tags are copied from
                               the volume, regardless of this value.

                            OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                               The configuration  object  that  specifies  the
                               snapshot  to  use as the origin of the data for
                               the volume.

                               SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a  given
                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services resources. We require an ARN  when
                                   you  need  to  specify a resource unambigu-
                                   ously across all of  Amazon  Web  Services.

                                   the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   o CLONE - The  new  volume  references  the
                                     data  in  the  origin snapshot. Cloning a
                                     snapshot is faster than copying the  data
                                     from  a  snapshot  to  a  new  volume and
                                     doesn't consume disk throughput. However,
                                     the  origin  snapshot can't be deleted if
                                     there is a volume using its copied  data.

                                   o FULL_COPY  -  Copies  all  data  from the
                                     snapshot to the new volume.

                            ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                               A Boolean value indicating whether  the  volume
                               is read-only.

                                      the file system is accessible from.  For
                                      the   Amazon   FSx   Windows  and  ONTAP
                                      MULTI_AZ_1 file system deployment  type,
                                      there  are  two  subnet IDs, one for the
                                      preferred file server and  one  for  the
                                      standby  file server. The preferred file
                                      server subnet  identified  in  the  Pre-

                                      For FSx for  Lustre  file  systems,  and
                                      Single-AZ  Windows file systems, this is
                                      the ID of the subnet that  contains  the
                                      file  system's  endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1
                                      Windows and ONTAP file systems, the file
                                      system endpoint is available in the Pre-
                                      ferredSubnetID .

                                          you  specify  one  or more tags when
                                          creating a user-initiated backup, no
                                          tags  are  copied from the file sys-

                                          the Amazon FSx file system.  Aliases
                                          allow  you to use existing DNS names
                                          to access the data  in  your  Amazon
                                          FSx  file  system. You can associate
                                          up to 50 aliases with a file  system
                                          at any time. You can associate addi-
                                          tional DNS aliases after you  create
                                          the file system using the Associate-
                                          FileSystemAliases operation. You can
                                          remove  DNS  aliases  from  the file

                                             and  shorter-term  processing  of
                                             data.  The  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                             type  provides in-transit encryp-
                                             tion of  data  and  higher  burst

                                          mat HH:MM . HH  is  the  zero-padded
                                          hour  of  the  day (0-23), and MM is
                                          the zero-padded minute of the  hour.
                                          For  example,  05:00  specifies 5 AM
                                          daily.

                                      AutomaticBackupRetentionDays  ->  (inte-

                                          to backups. If it's set to true, all
                                          tags  on  the file system are copied
                                          to all  automatic  backups  and  any
                                          user-initiated   backups  where  the
                                          user doesn't specify  any  tags.  If
                                          this  value is true, and you specify
                                          one or more tags, only the specified
                                          tags  are  copied to backups. If you

                                      DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                          The type of drive cache used by PER-
                                          SISTENT_1 file systems that are pro-
                                          visioned with HDD  storage  devices.
                                          This   parameter  is  required  when
                                          StorageType is HDD. When set to READ
                                          the  file  system has an SSD storage
                                          cache that is sized to  20%  of  the
                                          file system's storage capacity. This
                                          improves the  performance  for  fre-
                                          quently accessed files by caching up
                                          to 20% of the total  storage  capac-
                                          ity.

                                          This   parameter  is  required  when
                                          StorageType is set to HDD.

                                          true  ,  all tags on the file system
                                          are copied to all automatic  backups

                                          specify  tags. If this value is true
                                          and you specify one  or  more  tags,
                                          only  the  specified tags are copied
                                          to snapshots. If you specify one  or

                                          tual machine.

                                      StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                          A Boolean  flag  indicating  whether
                                          this  volume  is the root volume for
                                          its storage virtual  machine  (SVM).
                                          Only one volume on an SVM can be the
                                          root volume. This value defaults  to
                                          false . If this value is true , then
                                          this is the SVM root volume.

                                          This  flag  is  useful  when  you're
                                          deleting  an  SVM,  because you must
                                          first delete all  non-root  volumes.
                                          This flag, when set to false , helps
                                          you identify which volumes to delete
                                          before you can delete the SVM.

                                             corresponding tag key. Tag values
                                             can be null and don't have to  be
                                             unique in a tag set. For example,

                                          reserved.

                                      StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                          The maximum  amount  of  storage  in

                                          use from its parent. You can specify
                                          a  quota  larger than the storage on
                                          the parent volume.

                                      DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                          The method used to compress the data
                                          on  the volume. Unless a compression
                                          type is specified,  volumes  inherit
                                          the   DataCompressionType  value  of
                                          their parent volume.

                                          o NONE - Doesn't compress  the  data
                                            on the volume.

                                          o ZSTD  - Compresses the data in the
                                            volume using the Zstandard  (ZSTD)
                                            compression  algorithm. This algo-
                                            rithm reduces the amount of  space
                                            used  on  your volume and has very
                                            little    impact    on     compute
                                            resources.

                                      CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                          A  Boolean  value indicating whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to snapshots. This value defaults to
                                          false . If it's set to  true  ,  all
                                          tags  for  the  volume are copied to
                                          snapshots  where  the  user  doesn't
                                          specify  tags. If this value is true
                                          and you specify one  or  more  tags,
                                          only  the  specified tags are copied
                                          to snapshots. If you specify one  or
                                          more  tags  when  creating the snap-
                                          shot, no tags are  copied  from  the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                      OriginSnapshot -> (structure)

                                               snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is
                                               faster  than  copying  the data
                                               from a snapshot to a new volume

                                      given  resource.  ARNs uniquely identify
                                      Amazon  Web   Services   resources.   We
                                      require  an ARN when you need to specify
                                      a resource unambiguously across  all  of
                                      Amazon  Web  Services. For more informa-

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies a  key-value  pair  for  a
                                          resource tag.

                                          Key -> (string)
                                             A value that specifies the TagKey
                                             , the name of the tag.  Tag  keys
                                             must  be  unique for the resource
                                             to which they are attached.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             A value that specifies  the  Tag-
                                             Value , the value assigned to the
                                             corresponding tag key. Tag values
                                             can  be null and don't have to be
                                             unique in a tag set. For example,
                                             you  can have a key-value pair in
                                             a tag set of finances : April and
                                             also of payroll : April .

              OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration of an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume.

                 ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                     The ID of the parent volume.

                 VolumePath -> (string)
                     The path to the volume from the root volume. For example,
                     fsx/parentVolume/volume1 .

                 StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                     The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to reserve  from
                     the  parent  volume.  You can't reserve more storage than
                     the parent volume has reserved.

                 StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                     The maximum amount of storage in gibibtyes (GiB) that the
                     volume  can  use from its parent. You can specify a quota
                     larger than the storage on the parent volume.

                 DataCompressionType -> (string)
                     The method used to  compress  the  data  on  the  volume.
                     Unless  a  compression type is specified, volumes inherit
                     the DataCompressionType value of their parent volume.

                     o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the volume.

                     o ZSTD - Compresses the data  in  the  volume  using  the
                       Zstandard  (ZSTD) compression algorithm. This algorithm
                       reduces the amount of space used on your volume and has
                       very little impact on compute resources.

                 CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                     A  Boolean  value  indicating whether tags for the volume
                     should be copied to snapshots.  This  value  defaults  to
                     false . If it's set to true , all tags for the volume are
                     copied to snapshots where the user doesn't specify  tags.
                     If  this  value is true and you specify one or more tags,
                     only the specified tags are copied to snapshots.  If  you
                     specify  one  or more tags when creating the snapshot, no
                     tags are copied  from  the  volume,  regardless  of  this
                     value.

                 OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                     The  configuration  object that specifies the snapshot to
                     use as the origin of the data for the volume.

                     SnapshotARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a  given  resource.
                        ARNs  uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.
                        We require an ARN when you need to specify a  resource
                        unambiguously  across  all of Amazon Web Services. For
                        more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  in
                        the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                     CopyStrategy -> (string)
                        The  strategy used when copying data from the snapshot
                        to the new volume.

                        o CLONE - The new volume references the  data  in  the
                          origin  snapshot.  Cloning a snapshot is faster than
                          copying the data from a snapshot to a new volume and
                          doesn't consume disk throughput. However, the origin
                          snapshot can't be deleted if there is a volume using
                          its copied data.

                        o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot to the
                          new volume.

                 ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                     A  Boolean  value  indicating  whether  the   volume   is
                     read-only.

                 NfsExports -> (list)
                     The configuration object for mounting a Network File Sys-
                     tem (NFS) file system.

                     (structure)
                        The Network File System NFS) configurations for mount-
                        ing an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                        ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                            A  list  of configuration objects that contain the
                            client and options for mounting the  OpenZFS  file
                            system.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies who can mount the file system and the
                               options that can be  used  while  mounting  the
                               file system.

                               Clients -> (string)
                                   A  value  that  specifies who can mount the
                                   file system. You  can  provide  a  wildcard
                                   character  (*  ), an IP address (0.0.0.0 ),
                                   or  a  CIDR  address  (192.0.2.0/24  .   By
                                   default, Amazon FSx uses the wildcard char-
                                   acter when specifying the client.

                               Options -> (list)
                                   The options to use when mounting  the  file
                                   system.  For a list of options that you can
                                   use with Network File System (NFS), see the
                                   exports(5) - Linux man page . When choosing
                                   your options, consider the following:

                                   o crossmount is used  by  default.  If  you
                                     don't  specify  crossmount  when changing
                                     the client configuration,  you  won't  be
                                     able  to  see or access snapshots in your
                                     file system's snapshot directory.

                                   o sync is used by default. If  you  instead
                                     specify  async  , the system acknowledges
                                     writes before writing  to  disk.  If  the
                                     system crashes before the writes are fin-
                                     ished, you lose the unwritten data.

                                   (string)

                 UserAndGroupQuotas -> (list)
                     An object specifying how much storage users or groups can
                     use on the volume.

                     (structure)
                        The configuration for how much storage a user or group
                        can use on the volume.

                        Type -> (string)
                            A value that specifies whether the  quota  applies
                            to a user or group.

                        Id -> (integer)
                            The ID of the user or group.

                        StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of storage that the user or group can
                            use in gibibytes (GiB).
