LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()                              LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  tags  for  an Amazon FSx file systems and backups in the case of
       Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

       When retrieving all tags, you can  optionally  specify  the  MaxResults
       parameter  to  limit  the  number  of  tags in a response. If more tags
       remain, Amazon FSx returns a NextToken value in the response.  In  this
       case,  send a later request with the NextToken request parameter set to
       the value of NextToken from the last response.

       This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of  your
       tags.  ListTagsForResource  is  called first without a NextToken value.
       Then the action continues to be called with the NextToken parameter set
       to  the value of the last NextToken value until a response has no Next-
       Token .

       When using this action, keep the following in mind:

       o The implementation might return fewer  than  MaxResults  file  system
         descriptions while still including a NextToken value.

       o The order of tags returned in the response of one ListTagsForResource
         call and the order  of  tags  returned  across  the  responses  of  a
         multi-call iteration is unspecified.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tags-for-resource is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Tags

SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-for-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon FSx resource that will have its tags listed.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          A list of tags on the resource.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag. Tag
                 keys must be unique  for  the  resource  to  which  they  are
                 attached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned to
                 the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and  don't
                 have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a
                 key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April and  also  of
                 payroll : April .

       NextToken -> (string)
          This is present if there are more tags than returned in the response
          (String). You can use the NextToken value in the  later  request  to
          fetch the tags.
