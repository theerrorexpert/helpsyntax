NAME
       describe-data-repository-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the description of specific Amazon FSx for Lustre data reposi-
       tory tasks, if one or more TaskIds values are provided in the  request,
       or  if  filters  are used in the request. You can use filters to narrow
       the response to include just tasks for specific file systems, or  tasks
       in  a  specific lifecycle state. Otherwise, it returns all data reposi-
       tory tasks owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon  Web
       Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

       When  retrieving  all tasks, you can paginate the response by using the
       optional MaxResults parameter to limit the number of tasks returned  in
       a  response. If more tasks remain, Amazon FSx returns a NextToken value
       in the response. In this case, send a later request with the  NextToken
       request parameter set to the value of NextToken from the last response.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-data-repository-tasks
          [--task-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-ids (list)
          (Optional) IDs of the tasks whose descriptions you want to  retrieve
          (String).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          (Optional) You can use filters to narrow the DescribeDataRepository-
          Tasks response to include just tasks for specific file  systems,  or
          tasks in a specific lifecycle state.

          (structure)
              (Optional)  An array of filter objects you can use to filter the
              response of data repository  tasks  you  will  see  in  the  the
              response.  You  can filter the tasks returned in the response by
              one or more file system IDs, task lifecycles, and by task  type.
              A filter object consists of a filter Name , and one or more Val-
              ues for the filter.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the task property  to  use  in  filtering  the  tasks
                 returned in the response.

                 o Use  file-system-id  to  retrieve data repository tasks for
                   specific file systems.

                 o Use task-lifecycle to retrieve data repository  tasks  with
                   one  or  more  specific  lifecycle states, as follows: CAN-
                   CELED, EXECUTING, FAILED, PENDING, and SUCCEEDED.

              Values -> (list)
                 Use Values to include the specific file system IDs  and  task
                 lifecycle states for the filters you are using.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "file-system-id"|"task-lifecycle"|"data-repository-association-id",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  resources  to return in the response. This
          value must be an integer greater than zero.

       --next-token (string)
          (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a  previous  opera-
          tion  (String). If present, this token indicates from what point you
          can continue processing the request, where  the  previous  NextToken
          value left off.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DataRepositoryTasks -> (list)
          The collection of data repository task descriptions returned.

          (structure)
              A  description of the data repository task. You use data reposi-
              tory tasks to perform bulk transfer operations between your Ama-
              zon FSx file system and a linked data repository.

              TaskId -> (string)
                 The  system-generated, unique 17-digit ID of the data reposi-
                 tory task.

              Lifecycle -> (string)
                 The lifecycle status of the data repository task, as follows:

                 o PENDING - Amazon FSx has not started the task.

                 o EXECUTING - Amazon FSx is processing the task.

                 o FAILED  - Amazon FSx was not able to complete the task. For
                   example, there may be files the task failed to process. The
                   DataRepositoryTaskFailureDetails   property  provides  more
                   information about task failures.

                 o SUCCEEDED - FSx completed the task successfully.

                 o CANCELED - Amazon FSx canceled the task and it did not com-
                   plete.

                 o CANCELING - FSx is in process of canceling the task.

                 NOTE:
                     You  cannot delete an FSx for Lustre file system if there
                     are data repository tasks for  the  file  system  in  the
                     PENDING  or  EXECUTING states. Please retry when the data
                     repository task is finished (with a status of CANCELED  ,
                     SUCCEEDED    ,   or   FAILED   ).   You   can   use   the
                     DescribeDataRepositoryTask action  to  monitor  the  task
                     status.  Contact  the FSx team if you need to delete your
                     file system immediately.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of data repository task.

                 o The EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY data repository task exports  from
                   your Lustre file system from to a linked S3 bucket.

                 o The  IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY  data  repository task
                   imports metadata changes from a linked S3  bucket  to  your
                   Lustre file system.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  the  resource was created, in seconds (since
                 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that Amazon FSx began processing the task.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that Amazon FSx completed processing the task, popu-
                 lated after the task is complete.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                 uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.  We  require
                 an  ARN  when  you  need  to specify a resource unambiguously
                 across all of Amazon Web Services. For more information,  see
                 Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services Gen-
                 eral Reference .

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        A value that specifies the TagKey , the  name  of  the
                        tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which
                        they are attached.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A value  that  specifies  the  TagValue  ,  the  value
                        assigned  to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can
                        be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set.  For
                        example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of
                        finances : April and also of payroll : April .

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon
                 FSx.

              Paths -> (list)
                 An  array  of  paths on the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system
                 that specify  the  data  for  the  data  repository  task  to
                 process.  For  example,  in an EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY task, the
                 paths specify which data to export to the linked data reposi-
                 tory.

                 (Default) If Paths is not specified, Amazon FSx uses the file
                 system root directory.

                 (string)

              FailureDetails -> (structure)
                 Failure message describing why the task failed, it  is  popu-
                 lated only when Lifecycle is set to FAILED .

                 Message -> (string)
                     A detailed error message.

              Status -> (structure)
                 Provides  the status of the number of files that the task has
                 processed successfully and failed to process.

                 TotalCount -> (long)
                     The total number of files that  the  task  will  process.
                     While a task is executing, the sum of SucceededCount plus
                     FailedCount may not equal TotalCount . When the  task  is
                     complete,  TotalCount  equals  the  sum of SucceededCount
                     plus FailedCount .

                 SucceededCount -> (long)
                     A running total of the number of files that the task  has
                     successfully processed.

                 FailedCount -> (long)
                     A  running  total  of  the  number of files that the task
                     failed to process.

                 LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time at which the task status was last updated.

              Report -> (structure)
                 Provides a report detailing the data repository task  results
                 of  the  files processed that match the criteria specified in
                 the report Scope parameter. FSx delivers the  report  to  the
                 file  system's linked data repository in Amazon S3, using the
                 path specified in the report Path parameter. You can  specify
                 whether  or  not a report gets generated for a task using the
                 Enabled parameter.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Set Enabled to True to generate a  CompletionReport  when
                     the  task  completes.  If  set to true , then you need to
                     provide a report Scope , Path , and Format . Set  Enabled
                     to  False if you do not want a CompletionReport generated
                     when the task completes.

                 Path -> (string)
                     Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the  loca-
                     tion  of  the  report on the file system's linked S3 data
                     repository. An absolute path that defines where the  com-
                     pletion  report  will  be stored in the destination loca-
                     tion. The Path you provide must  be  located  within  the
                     file   systems  ExportPath.  An  example  Path  value  is
                     "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix".  The  report
                     provides  the  following information for each file in the
                     report: FilePath, FileStatus,  and  ErrorCode.  To  learn
                     more about a file system's ExportPath , see .

                 Format -> (string)
                     Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the format
                     of the CompletionReport . REPORT_CSV_20191124 is the only
                     format   currently  supported.  When  Format  is  set  to
                     REPORT_CSV_20191124 , the CompletionReport is provided in
                     CSV  format,  and  is delivered to {path}/task-{id}/fail-
                     ures.csv .

                 Scope -> (string)
                     Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the  scope
                     of  the  CompletionReport ; FAILED_FILES_ONLY is the only
                     scope  currently  supported.  When  Scope   is   set   to
                     FAILED_FILES_ONLY  ,  the  CompletionReport only contains
                     information about files that  the  data  repository  task
                     failed to process.

       NextToken -> (string)
          (Optional)  Opaque  pagination token returned from a previous opera-
          tion (String). If present, this token indicates from what point  you
          can  continue  processing  the request, where the previous NextToken
          value left off.
