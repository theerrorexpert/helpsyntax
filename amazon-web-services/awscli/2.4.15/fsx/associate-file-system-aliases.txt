ASSOCIATE-FILE-SYSTEM-ALIASES()                ASSOCIATE-FILE-SYSTEM-ALIASES()



NAME
       associate-file-system-aliases -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  action  to  associate  one  or more Domain Name Server (DNS)
       aliases with an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server  file  sys-
       tem. A file system can have a maximum of 50 DNS aliases associated with
       it at any one time. If you try to associate a DNS alias that is already
       associated  with  the file system, FSx takes no action on that alias in
       the request. For more information, see Working  with  DNS  Aliases  and
       Walkthrough 5: Using DNS aliases to access your file system , including
       additional steps you must take to be able to access  your  file  system
       using a DNS alias.

       The system response shows the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting
       to associate with the file system. Use the API operation to monitor the
       status of the aliases Amazon FSx is associating with the file system.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-file-system-aliases
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          --file-system-id <value>
          --aliases <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional)  An  idempotency token for resource creation, in a string
          of up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled  on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --file-system-id (string)
          Specifies the file system with which you want to  associate  one  or
          more DNS aliases.

       --aliases (list)
          An  array  of one or more DNS alias names to associate with the file
          system. The alias name has to comply with the  following  formatting
          requirements:

          o Formatted  as  a  fully-qualified  domain  name  (FQDN),  *  host-
            name.domain * , for example, accounting.corp.example.com .

          o Can contain alphanumeric characters and the hyphen (-).

          o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

          o Can start with a numeric.

          For DNS alias names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as low-
          ercase  letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as upper-
          case letters, lowercase letters, or  the  corresponding  letters  in
          escape codes.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Aliases -> (list)
          An  array of the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is associating with the
          file system.

          (structure)
              A DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You can use
              a  DNS  alias  to  access  a  file system using user-defined DNS
              names, in addition to the  default  DNS  name  that  Amazon  FSx
              assigns  to  the  file  system.  For  more  information, see DNS
              aliases in the FSx for Windows File Server User Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the DNS alias. The alias name  has  to  meet  the
                 following requirements:

                 o Formatted  as  a  fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), host-
                   name.domain , for example, accounting.example.com .

                 o Can contain alphanumeric characters,  the  underscore  (_),
                   and the hyphen (-).

                 o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                 o Can start with a numeric.

                 For  DNS  names,  Amazon  FSx stores alphabetic characters as
                 lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify  them:
                 as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding
                 letters in escape codes.

              Lifecycle -> (string)
                 Describes the state of the DNS alias.

                 o AVAILABLE - The DNS alias is associated with an Amazon  FSx
                   file system.

                 o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS alias and associ-
                   ating it with the file system.

                 o CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to associate the  DNS
                   alias with the file system.

                 o DELETING  - Amazon FSx is disassociating the DNS alias from
                   the file system and deleting it.

                 o DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to  disassociate  the
                   DNS alias from the file system.
