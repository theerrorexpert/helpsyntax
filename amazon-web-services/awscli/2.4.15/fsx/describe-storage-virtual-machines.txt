SYNOPSIS
            describe-storage-virtual-machines
          [--storage-virtual-machine-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --storage-virtual-machine-ids (list)
          Enter the ID of one or more SVMs that you want to view.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          Enter a filter name:value pair to view a select set of SVMs.

          (structure)
              A filter used to restrict the results of describe calls for Ama-
              zon  FSx  for  NetApp ONTAP storage virtual machines (SVMs). You
              can use multiple filters to return results that meet all applied
              filter requirements.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name for this filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of the filter. These are all the values for any of
                 the applied filters.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "file-system-id",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of resources to  return  in  the  response.  This
          value must be an integer greater than zero.

       --next-token (string)
          (Optional)  Opaque  pagination token returned from a previous opera-
          tion (String). If present, this token indicates from what point  you
          can  continue  processing  the request, where the previous NextToken
          value left off.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
