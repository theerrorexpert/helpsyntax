DELETE-BACKUP()                                                DELETE-BACKUP()



NAME
       delete-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an  Amazon  FSx  backup.  After deletion, the backup no longer
       exists, and its data is gone.

       The DeleteBackup call returns instantly. The backup won't  show  up  in
       later DescribeBackups calls.

       WARNING:
          The  data in a deleted backup is also deleted and can't be recovered
          by any means.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-backup
          --backup-id <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The ID of the backup that you want to delete.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure
          idempotent  deletion. This parameter is automatically filled on your
          behalf when using the CLI or SDK.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BackupId -> (string)
          The ID of the backup that was deleted.

       Lifecycle -> (string)
          The lifecycle status of the backup. If the DeleteBackup operation is
          successful, the status is DELETED .
