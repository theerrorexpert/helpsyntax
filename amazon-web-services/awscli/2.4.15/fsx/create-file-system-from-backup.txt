CREATE-FILE-SYSTEM-FROM-BACKUP()              CREATE-FILE-SYSTEM-FROM-BACKUP()



NAME
       create-file-system-from-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  Amazon  FSx  for  Lustre,  Amazon FSx for Windows File
       Server, or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system from an  existing  Amazon
       FSx backup.

       If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the
       parameters match, this operation returns the description  of  the  file
       system. If a client request token with the specified by the file system
       exists and the parameters don't match,  this  call  returns  Incompati-
       bleParameterError  . If a file system with the specified client request
       token doesn't exist, this operation does the following:

       o Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from backup with an assigned ID,
         and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING .

       o Returns the description of the file system.

       Parameters  like  the  Active  Directory, default share name, automatic
       backup, and backup settings default to the parameters of the file  sys-
       tem  that  was  backed up, unless overridden. You can explicitly supply
       other settings.

       By using the idempotent operation, you can  retry  a  CreateFileSystem-
       FromBackup call without the risk of creating an extra file system. This
       approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way  that  makes
       it  unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a trans-
       port level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If  you  use
       the  same client request token and the initial call created a file sys-
       tem, the client receives a success message as long  as  the  parameters
       are the same.

       NOTE:
          The  CreateFileSystemFromBackup call returns while the file system's
          lifecycle state is still CREATING . You can  check  the  file-system
          creation  status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which
          returns the file system state along with other information.

OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The ID of the source backup. Specifies the backup that you are copy-
          ing.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure
          idempotent creation. This string is  automatically  filled  on  your
          behalf  when  you  use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon
          Web Services SDK.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          Specifies the IDs of the subnets that the file system will be acces-
          sible  from.  For  Windows  MULTI_AZ_1 file system deployment types,
          provide exactly two subnet IDs, one for the  preferred  file  server
          and  one  for the standby file server. You specify one of these sub-
          nets as the preferred subnet using the WindowsConfiguration  >  Pre-
          ferredSubnetID property.

          Windows  SINGLE_AZ_1  and  SINGLE_AZ_2 file system deployment types,
          Lustre file systems, and OpenZFS file systems  provide  exactly  one
          subnet ID. The file server is launched in that subnet's Availability
          Zone.

          (string)
              The ID for a subnet. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your
              virtual  private  cloud (VPC). For more information, see VPC and
              subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-group-ids (list)
          A list of IDs for the security groups that apply  to  the  specified
          network  interfaces  created  for file system access. These security
          groups apply to all network interfaces. This value isn't returned in
          later DescribeFileSystem requests.

          (string)
              The  ID  of  your  Amazon EC2 security group. This ID is used to
              control network access to the endpoint that Amazon  FSx  creates
              on  your behalf in each subnet. For more information, see Amazon
              EC2 Security groups for Linux instances in the Amazon  EC2  User
              Guide .

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The  tags  to be applied to the file system at file system creation.
          The key value of the Name tag appears in the  console  as  the  file
          system name.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag. Tag
                 keys must be unique  for  the  resource  to  which  they  are
                 attached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned to
                 the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and  don't
                 have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a
                 key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April and  also  of
                 payroll : April .

              The  ID  for  an  existing Amazon Web Services Managed Microsoft
              Active Directory (AD) instance that the file system should  join
              when it's created.

          SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration that Amazon FSx uses to join a FSx for Windows
              File Server file system or  an  ONTAP  storage  virtual  machine
              (SVM) to a self-managed (including on-premises) Microsoft Active
              Directory (AD) directory. For more information, see Using Amazon
              FSx   with  your  self-managed  Microsoft  Active  Directory  or
              Managing SVMs .

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified domain name of the self-managed AD direc-
                 tory, such as corp.example.com .

                 (Optional)  The  fully  qualified  distinguished  name of the
                 organizational unit within your  self-managed  AD  directory.
                 Amazon  FSx  only accepts OU as the direct parent of the file
                 system. An example is  OU=FSx,DC=yourdomain,DC=corp,DC=com  .
                 To  learn  more,  see RFC 2253 . If none is provided, the FSx
                 file system is  created  in  the  default  location  of  your
                 self-managed AD directory.

                 WARNING:
                     Only  Organizational  Unit (OU) objects can be the direct
                     parent of the file system that you're creating.

              FileSystemAdministratorsGroup -> (string)
                 (Optional) The name of the domain  group  whose  members  are
                 granted administrative privileges for the file system. Admin-
                 istrative privileges include taking ownership  of  files  and
                 folders,  setting  audit  controls  (audit ACLs) on files and
                 folders, and administering the file system remotely by  using
                 the  FSx  Remote  PowerShell. The group that you specify must
                 already exist in your domain. If you don't provide one,  your
                 AD domain's Domain Admins group is used.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The user name for the service account on your self-managed AD
                 domain that Amazon FSx will use to join to  your  AD  domain.
                 This  account  must  have the permission to join computers to
                 the domain in the organizational unit provided  in  Organiza-
                 tionalUnitDistinguishedName  ,  or in the default location of
                 your AD domain.

              Password -> (string)
                 The password for the service account on your self-managed  AD
                 domain that Amazon FSx will use to join to your AD domain.

              DnsIps -> (list)
                 A  list  of up to three IP addresses of DNS servers or domain
                 controllers in the self-managed AD directory.

                 (string)

          DeploymentType -> (string)
              Specifies the file system deployment type, valid values are  the
              following:

              o MULTI_AZ_1  -  Deploys a high availability file system that is
                configured  for  Multi-AZ  redundancy  to  tolerate  temporary
                Availability  Zone  (AZ) unavailability. You can only deploy a
                Multi-AZ file system in Amazon Web Services Regions that  have
                a minimum of three Availability Zones. Also supports HDD stor-
                age type

              o SINGLE_AZ_1 - (Default) Choose to deploy a file system that is
                configured for single AZ redundancy.

              o SINGLE_AZ_2  -  The  latest  generation Single AZ file system.
                Specifies a file system  that  is  configured  for  single  AZ
                redundancy and supports HDD storage type.

              For more information, see Availability and Durability: Single-AZ
              and Multi-AZ File Systems .

          PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
              Required when DeploymentType is set to MULTI_AZ_1 . This  speci-
              fies  the  subnet in which you want the preferred file server to
              be located. For in-Amazon Web Services applications,  we  recom-
              mend  that you launch your clients in the same Availability Zone
              (AZ) as your preferred  file  server  to  reduce  cross-AZ  data
              transfer costs and minimize latency.

          ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)
              Sets  the throughput capacity of an Amazon FSx file system, mea-
              sured in megabytes per second (MB/s), in 2 to the  n  th  incre-
              ments, between 2^3 (8) and 2^11 (2048).

          WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
              The  preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance, format-
              ted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone, where d is the weekday number,
              from  1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.

          DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
              The preferred time to take daily  automatic  backups,  formatted
              HH:MM in the UTC time zone.

          AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
              The  number  of days to retain automatic backups. The default is
              to retain backups for 7 days. Setting this value to  0  disables
              the  creation of automatic backups. The maximum retention period
              for backups is 90 days.

          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
              A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags  for  the  file  system
              should  be  copied  to backups. This value defaults to false. If
              it's set to true, all tags for the file system are copied to all
              automatic  and  user-initiated  backups  where  the user doesn't
              specify tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more
              tags,  only  the  specified  tags  are copied to backups. If you
              specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated  backup,
              no  tags  are  copied  from  the file system, regardless of this
              value.

          Aliases -> (list)
              An array of one or more DNS alias names that you want  to  asso-
              ciate  with the Amazon FSx file system. Aliases allow you to use
              existing DNS names to access the data in your  Amazon  FSx  file
              system. You can associate up to 50 aliases with a file system at
              any time. You can associate additional  DNS  aliases  after  you
              create  the  file  system  using  the AssociateFileSystemAliases
              operation. You can remove DNS aliases from the file system after
              it is created using the DisassociateFileSystemAliases operation.
              You only need to specify the alias name in the request  payload.

              For   more   information,  see  Working  with  DNS  Aliases  and
              Walkthrough 5: Using DNS aliases to access your  file  system  ,
              including  additional  steps  you must take to be able to access
              your file system using a DNS alias.

              An alias name has to meet the following requirements:

              o Formatted as  a  fully-qualified  domain  name  (FQDN),  host-
                name.domain , for example, accounting.example.com .

              o Can  contain  alphanumeric characters, the underscore (_), and
                the hyphen (-).

              o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

              o Can start with a numeric.

              For DNS alias names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters  as
              lowercase  letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as
              uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding  let-
              ters in escape codes.

              (string)

          AuditLogConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  configuration  that Amazon FSx for Windows File Server uses
              to audit and log user  accesses  of  files,  folders,  and  file
              shares on the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system.

              FileAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                 Sets  which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file and
                 folder accesses.

                 o SUCCESS_ONLY - only successful attempts to access files  or
                   folders are logged.

                 o FAILURE_ONLY  -  only  failed  attempts  to access files or
                   folders are logged.

                 o SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE - both successful attempts  and  failed
                   attempts to access files or folders are logged.

                 o DISABLED  -  access auditing of files and folders is turned
                   off.

              FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                 Sets which attempt type is logged  by  Amazon  FSx  for  file
                 share accesses.

                 o SUCCESS_ONLY  -  only  successful  attempts  to access file
                   shares are logged.

                 o FAILURE_ONLY - only failed attempts to access  file  shares
                   are logged.

                 o SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE  -  both successful attempts and failed
                   attempts to access file shares are logged.

                 o DISABLED - access auditing of file shares is turned off.

              AuditLogDestination -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the destination
                 of the audit logs.

                 The  destination  can be any Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group
                 ARN or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream ARN, with
                 the following requirements:

                 o The  destination  ARN  that  you provide (either CloudWatch
                   Logs log group or Kinesis Data  Firehose  delivery  stream)
                   must  be  in the same Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon
                   Web Services Region, and Amazon  Web  Services  account  as
                   your Amazon FSx file system.

                 o The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin
                   with the /aws/fsx prefix. The name of  the  Amazon  Kinesis
                   Data  Firehouse delivery stream must begin with the aws-fsx
                   prefix.

                 o If you do not provide a destination in  AuditLogDestination
                   , Amazon FSx will create and use a log stream in the Cloud-
                   Watch Logs /aws/fsx/windows log group.

                 o If AuditLogDestination is provided and  the  resource  does
                   not exist, the request will fail with a BadRequest error.

                 o If FileAccessAuditLogLevel and FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel
                   are both set to DISABLED , you cannot specify a destination
                   in AuditLogDestination .

              o ImportedChunkSize

              o ImportPath

          WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
              (Optional) The preferred start time to  perform  weekly  mainte-
              nance,  formatted  d:HH:MM  in the UTC time zone, where d is the
              weekday number, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and end-
              ing with Sunday.

          ImportPath -> (string)
              (Optional)  The  path  to  the  Amazon  S3 bucket (including the
              optional prefix) that you're using as the  data  repository  for
              your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. The root of your FSx for
              Lustre file system will be mapped to the root of the  Amazon  S3
              bucket        you        select.       An       example       is
              s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix . If  you  specify  a  prefix
              after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that pre-
              fix are loaded into the file system.

              NOTE:
                 This parameter is not supported for  file  systems  with  the
                 Persistent_2  deployment type. Instead, use CreateDataReposi-
                 toryAssociation to create a data  repository  association  to
                 link your Lustre file system to a data repository.

          ExportPath -> (string)
              (Optional)  Available  with  Scratch and Persistent_1 deployment
              types. Specifies the path in the Amazon S3 bucket where the root
              of  your  Amazon  FSx file system is exported. The path must use
              the same Amazon S3 bucket as specified in  ImportPath.  You  can
              provide  an  optional prefix to which new and changed data is to
              be exported from your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.  If  an
              ExportPath  value  is  not  provided,  Amazon FSx sets a default
              export path, s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]  .
              The    timestamp    is    in    UTC    format,    for    example
              s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z .

              The Amazon S3 export bucket must  be  the  same  as  the  import
              bucket  specified  by  ImportPath . If you specify only a bucket
              name, such as s3://import-bucket , you get a 1:1 mapping of file
              system objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the
              input data in S3 is overwritten on export. If you provide a cus-
              tom  prefix in the export path, such as s3://import-bucket/[cus-
              tom-optional-prefix] , Amazon FSx exports the contents  of  your
              file system to that export prefix in the Amazon S3 bucket.

              NOTE:
                 This  parameter  is  not  supported for file systems with the
                 Persistent_2 deployment type. Instead, use  CreateDataReposi-
                 toryAssociation  to  create  a data repository association to
                 link your Lustre file system to a data repository.

          ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
              (Optional) For files imported from a data repository, this value
              determines  the stripe count and maximum amount of data per file
              (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number of
              disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the
              total number of disks that make up the file system.

              The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go  as  high
              as  512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size
              of 5 TB.

              This parameter is not supported for file systems with  the  Per-
              sistent_2  deployment type. Instead, use CreateDataRepositoryAs-
              sociation to create a data repository association to  link  your
              Lustre file system to a data repository.

          DeploymentType -> (string)
              (Optional)  Choose SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 deployment types when
              you need temporary storage and shorter-term processing of  data.
              The  SCRATCH_2 deployment type provides in-transit encryption of
              data and higher burst throughput capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

              Choose PERSISTENT_1 for longer-term  storage  and  for  through-
              put-focused workloads that arent latency-sensitive. PERSISTENT_1
              supports encryption of data in transit, and is available in  all
              Amazon  Web  Services  Regions in which FSx for Lustre is avail-
              able.

              Choose PERSISTENT_2 for longer-term storage and for latency-sen-
              sitive   workloads   that   require   the   highest   levels  of
              IOPS/throughput. PERSISTENT_2 supports SSD storage,  and  offers
              higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB). PERSIS-
              TENT_2 is available in a limited number of Amazon  Web  Services
              Regions.  For more information, and an up-to-date list of Amazon
              Web Services Regions in which  PERSISTENT_2  is  available,  see
              File  system deployment options for FSx for Lustre in the Amazon
              FSx for Lustre User Guide .

              NOTE:
                 If you choose PERSISTENT_2 , and you  set  FileSystemTypeVer-
                 sion to 2.10 , the CreateFileSystem operation fails.

              Encryption  of  data  in transit is automatically turned on when
              you access SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2  file  sys-
              tems from Amazon EC2 instances that support automatic encryption
              in the Amazon Web Services Regions where they are available. For
              more  information about encryption in transit for FSx for Lustre
              file systems, see Encrypting data in transit in the  Amazon  FSx
              for Lustre User Guide .

              (Default = SCRATCH_1 )

          AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
              (Optional)  Available  with  Scratch and Persistent_1 deployment
              types. When you  create  your  file  system,  your  existing  S3
              objects appear as file and directory listings. Use this property
              to choose how Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory  listings
              up  to  date  as  you  add  or  modify objects in your linked S3
              bucket. AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

              o NONE - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon  FSx  only  updates
                file and directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the
                file system is created. FSx does not update file and directory
                listings  for  any  new or changed objects after choosing this
                option.

              o NEW - AutoImport  is  on.  Amazon  FSx  automatically  imports
                directory  listings  of any new objects added to the linked S3
                bucket that do not currently exist in the FSx file system.

              o NEW_CHANGED -  AutoImport  is  on.  Amazon  FSx  automatically
                imports  file  and directory listings of any new objects added
                to the S3 bucket and any existing objects that are changed  in
                the S3 bucket after you choose this option.

              o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED  -  AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automati-
                cally imports file and directory listings of any  new  objects
                added  to the S3 bucket, any existing objects that are changed
                in the S3 bucket, and any objects that were deleted in the  S3
                bucket.

              For more information, see Automatically import updates from your
              S3 bucket .

              NOTE:
                 This parameter is not supported for  file  systems  with  the
                 Persistent_2  deployment type. Instead, use CreateDataReposi-
                 toryAssociation" to create a data repository  association  to
                 link your Lustre file system to a data repository.

          PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
              Required  with  PERSISTENT_1  and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types,
              provisions the amount of read and write throughput  for  each  1
              tebibyte  (TiB)  of  file  system storage capacity, in MB/s/TiB.
              File system throughput capacity is calculated by multiplying  le
              system  storage  capacity  (TiB) by the PerUnitStorageThroughput
              (MB/s/TiB). For a 2.4-TiB le system, provisioning 50 MB/s/TiB of
              PerUnitStorageThroughput  yields  120 MB/s of le system through-
              put. You pay for the amount of throughput that you provision.

              Valid values:

              o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200 MB/s/TiB.

              o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40 MB/s/TiB.

              o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000 MB/s/TiB.

          DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
              A recurring daily  time,  in  the  format  HH:MM  .  HH  is  the
              zero-padded  hour  of  the day (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded
              minute of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

          AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
              The number of days to retain  automatic  backups.  Setting  this
              property  to  0 disables automatic backups. You can retain auto-
              matic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
              (Optional) Not available for use  with  file  systems  that  are
              linked  to  a data repository. A boolean flag indicating whether
              tags for the file  system  should  be  copied  to  backups.  The
              default value is false. If CopyTagsToBackups is set to true, all
              file system tags are copied to all automatic and  user-initiated
              backups  when the user doesn't specify any backup-specific tags.
              If CopyTagsToBackups is set to true and you specify one or  more
              backup  tags,  only the specified tags are copied to backups. If
              you specify one or more  tags  when  creating  a  user-initiated
              backup,  no  tags are copied from the file system, regardless of
              this value.

              (Default = false )

              For more information, see Working with backups in the Amazon FSx
              for Lustre User Guide .

          DriveCacheType -> (string)
              The  type  of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems that
              are provisioned with HDD  storage  devices.  This  parameter  is
              required  when storage type is HDD. Set this property to READ to
              improve the performance for frequently accessed files by caching
              up to 20% of the total storage capacity of the file system.

              This parameter is required when StorageType is set to HDD .

          DataCompressionType -> (string)
              Sets  the  data  compression  configuration for the file system.
              DataCompressionType can have the following values:

              o NONE - (Default) Data compression is turned off when the  file
                system is created.

              o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm.

              For  more information, see Lustre data compression in the Amazon
              FSx for Lustre User Guide .

          LogConfiguration -> (structure)
              The Lustre logging configuration used when  creating  an  Amazon
              FSx for Lustre file system. When logging is enabled, Lustre logs
              error and warning events for data repositories  associated  with
              your file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              Level -> (string)
                 Sets which data repository events are logged by Amazon FSx.

                 o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                 o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                 o WARN_ERROR  -  both  warning  events  and  error events are
                   logged.

                 o DISABLED - logging of data repository events is turned off.

              Destination -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the destination
                 of the logs.

                 The destination can be any Amazon CloudWatch Logs  log  group
                 ARN, with the following requirements:

                 o The  destination  ARN  that you provide must be in the same
                   Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon Web Services  Region,
                   and  Amazon  Web  Services  account as your Amazon FSx file
                   system.

                 o The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin
                   with the /aws/fsx prefix.

                 o If you do not provide a destination, Amazon FSx will create
                   and use a log stream in the CloudWatch Logs /aws/fsx/lustre
                   log group.

                 o If Destination is provided and the resource does not exist,
                   the request will fail with a BadRequest error.

                 o If Level is set to DISABLED , you cannot specify a destina-
                   tion in Destination .

       --storage-type (string)
          Sets  the  storage  type for the Windows or OpenZFS file system that
          you're creating from a backup. Valid values are SSD and HDD .

          o Set to SSD to use solid state drive storage. SSD is  supported  on
            all Windows and OpenZFS deployment types.

          o Set  to  HDD  to  use hard disk drive storage. HDD is supported on
            SINGLE_AZ_2 and MULTI_AZ_1 FSx for Windows File Server file system
            deployment types.

          The default value is SSD .

          NOTE:
              HDD  and SSD storage types have different minimum storage capac-
              ity requirements. A restored file system's storage  capacity  is
              tied  to  the  file  system that was backed up. You can create a
              file system that uses HDD storage from a backup of a file system
              that  used  SSD  storage  if  the original SSD file system had a
              storage capacity of at least 2000 GiB.

          Possible values:

          o SSD

          o HDD

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the Key Management Service (KMS) key used to  encrypt  the
          file  system's data for Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file sys-
          tems, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems, and Amazon  FSx  for
          Lustre  PERSISTENT_1  and PERSISTENT_2 file systems at rest. If this
          ID isn't specified, the key managed by Amazon FSx is used. The  Ama-
          zon  FSx  for Lustre SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 file systems are always
          encrypted at rest using Amazon FSx-managed keys. For  more  informa-
          tion, see Encrypt in the Key Management Service API Reference .

       --file-system-type-version (string)
          Sets  the  version  for  the  Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that
          you're creating from a backup. Valid values are 2.10 and 2.12 .

          You don't need to specify FileSystemTypeVersion because it  will  be
          applied  using  the  backup's  FileSystemTypeVersion setting. If you
          choose to specify FileSystemTypeVersion when creating  from  backup,
          the value must match the backup's FileSystemTypeVersion setting.

       --open-zfs-configuration (structure)
          The  OpenZFS configuration for the file system that's being created.

          AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
              The number of days to retain  automatic  backups.  Setting  this
              property  to  0 disables automatic backups. You can retain auto-
              matic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating whether  tags  for  the  file  system
              should  be  copied to backups. This value defaults to false . If
              it's set to true , all tags for the file system  are  copied  to
              all  automatic and user-initiated backups where the user doesn't
              specify tags. If this value is true , and  you  specify  one  or
              more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you
              specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated  backup,
              no  tags  are  copied  from  the file system, regardless of this
              value.

          CopyTagsToVolumes -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume should be
              copied  to snapshots. This value defaults to false . If it's set
              to true , all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots  where
              the  user  doesn't specify tags. If this value is true , and you
              specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied  to
              snapshots.  If  you  specify  one or more tags when creating the
              snapshot, no tags are copied from the volume, regardless of this
              value.

          DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
              A  recurring  daily  time,  in  the  format  HH:MM  .  HH is the
              zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM  is  the  zero-padded
              minute of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

          DeploymentType -> (string)
              Specifies  the file system deployment type. Amazon FSx for Open-
              ZFS supports SINGLE_AZ_1 . SINGLE_AZ_1 is a file system  config-
              ured for a single Availability Zone (AZ) of redundancy.

          ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)
              Specifies  the throughput of an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file sys-
              tem, measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Valid  values  are
              64,  128,  256, 512, 1024, 2048, 3072, or 4096 MB/s. You pay for
              additional throughput capacity that you provision.

          WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
              A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                 D is the day of the week, for which 1 represents Monday and 7
                 represents Sunday. For further details, see the ISO-8601 spec
                 as described on Wikipedia .

                 HH is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM  is  the
                 zero-padded minute of the hour.

              For example, 1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5 AM Monday.

          DiskIopsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  SSD IOPS (input/output operations per second) configuration
              for an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP or  Amazon  FSx  for  OpenZFS
              file  system.  The default is 3 IOPS per GB of storage capacity,
              but you can provision additional IOPS per  GB  of  storage.  The
              configuration  consists  of  the total number of provisioned SSD
              IOPS and how the amount was provisioned (by the customer  or  by
              the system).

              Mode -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  the number of IOPS for the file system is
                 using the system default (AUTOMATIC ) or was  provisioned  by
                 the customer (USER_PROVISIONED ).

              Iops -> (long)
                 The total number of SSD IOPS provisioned for the file system.

              The configuration Amazon FSx uses when creating the  root  value
              of the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system. All volumes are chil-
              dren of the root volume.

              DataCompressionType -> (string)
                 Specifies the method used to compress the data on the volume.
                 Unless the compression type is specified, volumes inherit the
                 DataCompressionType value of their parent volume.

                 o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the volume.

                 o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the volume using  the  ZStan-
                   dard  (ZSTD)  compression algorithm. This algorithm reduces
                   the amount of space used on your volume and has very little
                   impact on compute resources.

              NfsExports -> (list)
                 The configuration object for mounting a file system.

                 (structure)
                     The  Network File System NFS) configurations for mounting
                     an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                     ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                        A list  of  configuration  objects  that  contain  the
                        client  and options for mounting the OpenZFS file sys-
                        tem.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies who can mount the file  system  and  the
                            options  that  can be used while mounting the file
                            system.

                            Clients -> (string)
                               A value that specifies who can mount  the  file
                               system. You can provide a wildcard character (*
                               ), an IP address (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR  address
                               (192.0.2.0/24 . By default, Amazon FSx uses the
                               wildcard character when specifying the  client.

                            Options -> (list)
                               The  options to use when mounting the file sys-
                               tem. For a list of options  that  you  can  use
                               with   Network   File  System  (NFS),  see  the
                               exports(5) - Linux man  page  .  When  choosing
                               your options, consider the following:

                               o crossmount  is  used by default. If you don't
                                 specify crossmount when changing  the  client
                                 configuration,  you  won't  be able to see or
                                 access snapshots in your file system's  snap-
                                 shot directory.

                               o sync is used by default. If you instead spec-
                                 ify async , the  system  acknowledges  writes
                                 before writing to disk. If the system crashes
                                 before the writes are finished, you lose  the
                                 unwritten data.

                               (string)

              UserAndGroupQuotas -> (list)
                 An object specifying how much storage users or groups can use
                 on the volume.

                 (structure)
                     The configuration for how much storage a  user  or  group
                     can use on the volume.

                     Type -> (string)
                        A  value that specifies whether the quota applies to a
                        user or group.

                     Id -> (integer)
                        The ID of the user or group.

                     StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                        The amount of storage that the user or group  can  use
                        in gibibytes (GiB).

              CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume should
                 be copied to snapshots. This value defaults  to  false  .  If
                 it's  set  to  true  ,  all tags for the volume are copied to
                 snapshots where the user doesn't specify tags. If this  value
                 is  true and you specify one or more tags, only the specified
                 tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify one or more tags
                 when  creating the snapshot, no tags are copied from the vol-
                 ume, regardless of this value.

              ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether the volume  is  read-only.
                 Setting  this value to true can be useful after you have com-
                 pleted changes to a volume and  no  longer  want  changes  to
                 occur.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              preferred file server and one for the standby file  server.  The
              preferred file server subnet identified in the PreferredSubnetID
              property. All other file systems have only one subnet ID.

              For FSx for Lustre file systems, and Single-AZ Windows file sys-
              tems,  this  is the ID of the subnet that contains the file sys-
              tem's endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows and ONTAP  file  systems,
              the file system endpoint is available in the PreferredSubnetID .

              that  the Amazon FSx file system was created in. For more infor-
              mation, see Elastic Network Interfaces in the  Amazon  EC2  User
              Guide.

              For  an  Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, you can
              have one network interface ID. For an Amazon FSx for Lustre file
              system, you can have more than one.

              (string)
                 An elastic network interface ID. An elastic network interface
                 is a logical networking component in a virtual private  cloud
                 (VPC) that represents a virtual network card. For more infor-
                 mation, see Elastic Network Interfaces in the Amazon EC2 User
                 Guide for Linux Instances .

              the file system's data for Amazon FSx for  Windows  File  Server
              file systems, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems, and PER-
              SISTENT Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems at rest. If  this  ID
              isn't  specified, the Amazon FSx-managed key for your account is
              used. The scratch Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems are  always
              encrypted  at  rest  using  the  Amazon FSx-managed key for your
              account. For more information, see Encrypt in the Key Management
              Service API Reference .

          ResourceARN -> (string)

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.
                     Tag keys must be unique for the resource  to  which  they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned
                     to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and
                     don't  have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you
                     can have a key-value pair in a  tag  set  of  finances  :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

                     A list of up to three IP  addresses  of  DNS  servers  or
                     domain controllers in the self-managed AD directory.

                     (string)

              DeploymentType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  file system deployment type, valid values are
                 the following:

                 o MULTI_AZ_1 - Specifies a high availability file system that
                   is configured for Multi-AZ redundancy to tolerate temporary
                   Availability Zone (AZ) unavailability, and supports SSD and
                   HDD storage.

                 o SINGLE_AZ_1  -  (Default)  Specifies  a file system that is
                   configured for single  AZ  redundancy,  only  supports  SSD
                   storage.

                 o SINGLE_AZ_2  -  Latest  generation  Single  AZ file system.
                   Specifies a file system that is configured  for  single  AZ
                   redundancy and supports SSD and HDD storage.

                 For more information, see Single-AZ and Multi-AZ File Systems
                 .

              RemoteAdministrationEndpoint -> (string)
                 For MULTI_AZ_1 deployment types, use this endpoint when  per-
                 forming  administrative tasks on the file system using Amazon
                 FSx Remote PowerShell.

                 For SINGLE_AZ_1 and SINGLE_AZ_2 deployment types, this is the
                 DNS name of the file system.

                 This endpoint is temporarily unavailable when the file system
                 is undergoing maintenance.

              PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
                 For MULTI_AZ_1 deployment types, it specifies the ID  of  the
                 subnet  where  the  preferred file server is located. Must be
                 one of the two subnet IDs specified  in  SubnetIds  property.
                 Amazon  FSx  serves  traffic  from  this subnet except in the
                 event of a failover to the secondary file server.

                 For SINGLE_AZ_1 and SINGLE_AZ_2 deployment types, this  value
                 is the same as that for SubnetIDs . For more information, see
                 Availability and durability: Single-AZ and Multi-AZ file sys-
                 tems .

              PreferredFileServerIp -> (string)
                 For  MULTI_AZ_1  deployment types, the IP address of the pri-
                 mary, or preferred, file server.

                 Use this IP address when mounting the file  system  on  Linux
                 SMB  clients  or Windows SMB clients that are not joined to a
                 Microsoft Active Directory. Applicable for all  Windows  file
                 system  deployment  types.  This  IP  address  is temporarily
                 unavailable when the file system is  undergoing  maintenance.
                 For  Linux  and  Windows  SMB  clients  that are joined to an
                 Active Directory, use the file system's DNSName instead.  For
                 more  information  on  mapping  and mounting file shares, see
                 Accessing File Shares .

              ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)

                     An enumeration specifying the currently  ongoing  mainte-
                     nance operation.

              WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                 The  preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance, for-
                 matted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone. d is the weekday number,
                 from  1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sun-
                 day.

              DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                 The preferred time to take daily automatic  backups,  in  the
                 UTC time zone.

              AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                 The  number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this
                 to 0 disables automatic backups.  You  can  retain  automatic
                 backups for a maximum of 90 days.

              CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                 A  boolean  flag  indicating  whether tags on the file system
                 should be copied to backups. This value defaults to false. If
                 it's  set  to true, all tags on the file system are copied to
                 all automatic backups and any  user-initiated  backups  where
                 the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and
                 you specify one or more tags, only  the  specified  tags  are
                 copied  to backups. If you specify one or more tags when cre-
                 ating a user-initiated backup, no tags are  copied  from  the
                 file system, regardless of this value.

              Aliases -> (list)
                 An  array of one or more DNS aliases that are currently asso-
                 ciated with the Amazon FSx file system. Aliases allow you  to
                 use  existing DNS names to access the data in your Amazon FSx
                 file system. You can associate up to 50 aliases with  a  file
                 system  at any time. You can associate additional DNS aliases
                 after you create the file system using the  AssociateFileSys-
                 temAliases  operation.  You  can  remove DNS aliases from the
                 file system after  it  is  created  using  the  Disassociate-
                 FileSystemAliases  operation.  You  only  need to specify the
                 alias name in the request payload. For more information,  see
                 DNS aliases .

                 (structure)
                     A  DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You
                     can use a  DNS  alias  to  access  a  file  system  using
                     user-defined  DNS  names,  in addition to the default DNS
                     name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system. For more
                     information,  see DNS aliases in the FSx for Windows File
                     Server User Guide .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the DNS alias. The alias name has to  meet
                        the following requirements:

                        o Formatted  as  a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN),
                          hostname.domain  ,  for  example,   accounting.exam-
                          ple.com .

                        o Can  contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore
                          (_), and the hyphen (-).

                        o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                        o Can start with a numeric.

                        For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters
                        as  lowercase  letters  (a-z),  regardless  of how you
                        specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
                        or the corresponding letters in escape codes.

                     Lifecycle -> (string)
                        Describes the state of the DNS alias.

                        o AVAILABLE - The DNS alias is associated with an Ama-
                          zon FSx file system.

                        o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS alias  and
                          associating it with the file system.

                        o CREATE_FAILED  -  Amazon FSx was unable to associate
                          the DNS alias with the file system.

                        o DELETING - Amazon  FSx  is  disassociating  the  DNS
                          alias from the file system and deleting it.

                        o DELETE_FAILED  - Amazon FSx was unable to disassoci-
                          ate the DNS alias from the file system.

              AuditLogConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration that Amazon FSx  for  Windows  File  Server
                 uses  to  audit  and log user accesses of files, folders, and
                 file shares on the Amazon FSx for Windows  File  Server  file
                 system.

                 FileAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                     Sets  which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file
                     and folder accesses.

                     o SUCCESS_ONLY - only successful attempts to access files
                       or folders are logged.

                     o FAILURE_ONLY  - only failed attempts to access files or
                       folders are logged.

                     o SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE  -  both  successful  attempts  and
                       failed  attempts to access files or folders are logged.

                     o DISABLED - access auditing  of  files  and  folders  is
                       turned off.

                 FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                     Sets  which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file

                     o FAILURE_ONLY  -  only  failed  attempts  to access file
                       shares are logged.

                     o SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE  -  both  successful  attempts  and
                       failed attempts to access file shares are logged.

                     o DISABLED  -  access  auditing  of file shares is turned
                       off.

                 AuditLogDestination -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the destination of the
                     audit  logs. The destination can be any Amazon CloudWatch
                     Logs log group ARN or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose deliv-
                     ery stream ARN.

                     The  name  of  the  Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must
                     begin with the /aws/fsx prefix. The name  of  the  Amazon
                     Kinesis  Data  Firehouse  delivery stream must begin with
                     the aws-fsx prefix.

                     The destination ARN (either CloudWatch Logs log group  or
                     Kinesis  Data  Firehose  delivery  stream) must be in the

                 tems returned in the response of the CreateFileSystem  opera-
                 tion.

                 This  data  type  is  not supported for file systems with the
                 Persistent_2 deployment type. Instead, use .

                 Lifecycle -> (string)
                     Describes the state of the file system's S3 durable  data
                     repository,  if  it  is configured with an S3 repository.
                     The lifecycle can have the following values:

                     o CREATING - The data  repository  configuration  between
                       the  FSx  file system and the linked S3 data repository
                       is being created. The data repository is unavailable.

                     o AVAILABLE - The data repository is available for use.

                     o MISCONFIGURED - Amazon FSx cannot automatically  import
                       updates  from  the  S3 bucket until the data repository
                       configuration is corrected. For more  information,  see
                       Troubleshooting a Misconfigured linked S3 bucket .

                     o UPDATING - The data repository is undergoing a customer
                       initiated update and availability may be impacted.

                     o FAILED - The data repository is  in  a  terminal  state
                       that cannot be recovered.

                 ImportPath -> (string)
                     The  import  path  to  the Amazon S3 bucket (and optional
                     prefix) that you're using as the data repository for your
                     FSx    for    Lustre    file    system,    for    example
                     s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix . If a prefix is spec-
                     ified  after  the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys
                     with that prefix are loaded into the file system.

                 ExportPath -> (string)
                     The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that
                     you are using to store new and changed Lustre file system
                     files in S3.

                 ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                     For files imported from a  data  repository,  this  value
                     determines  the  stripe  count and maximum amount of data
                     per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical  disk.  The
                     maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped
                     across is limited by the total number of disks that  make
                     up the file system.

                     The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as
                     high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects  have  a
                     maximum size of 5 TB.

                 AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                     Describes  the  file system's linked S3 data repository's
                     AutoImportPolicy . The  AutoImportPolicy  configures  how
                     Amazon  FSx  keeps your file and directory listings up to
                     date as you add or  modify  objects  in  your  linked  S3
                     bucket. AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

                     o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport  is off. Amazon FSx only
                       updates file and directory listings from the linked  S3
                       bucket  when  the  file system is created. FSx does not
                       update file and  directory  listings  for  any  new  or
                       changed objects after choosing this option.

                     o NEW  -  AutoImport  is  on.  Amazon  FSx  automatically
                       imports directory listings of any new objects added  to
                       the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist in the
                       FSx file system.

                     o NEW_CHANGED - AutoImport is on.  Amazon  FSx  automati-
                       cally  imports  file  and directory listings of any new
                       objects added to the S3 bucket and any existing objects
                       that are changed in the S3 bucket after you choose this
                       option.

                     o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED -  AutoImport  is  on.  Amazon  FSx
                       automatically  imports  file  and directory listings of
                       any new objects added to the S3  bucket,  any  existing
                       objects  that  are  changed  in  the S3 bucket, and any
                       objects that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                 FailureDetails -> (structure)
                     Provides detailed information about the data  respository
                     if its Lifecycle is set to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                     Message -> (string)
                        A detailed error message.

              DeploymentType -> (string)
                 The  deployment  type  of  the  FSx  for  Lustre file system.
                 Scratch deployment type is designed for temporary storage and
                 shorter-term processing of data.
                     SCRATCH_1  and SCRATCH_2 deployment types are best suited
                     for when you need temporary storage and shorter-term pro-
                     cessing  of  data. The SCRATCH_2 deployment type provides
                     in-transit encryption of data and higher burst throughput
                     capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                 The PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment type is used for
                 longer-term storage and workloads and encryption of  data  in
                 transit.  PERSISTENT_2  is  built  on Lustre v2.12 and offers
                 higher PerUnitStorageThroughput (up to 1000  MB/s/TiB)  along
                 with  a lower minimum storage capacity requirement (600 GiB).
                 To learn more about FSx for Lustre deployment types, see  FSx
                 for Lustre deployment options .

                 The default is SCRATCH_1 .

              PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                 Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per sec-
                 ond of read or write throughput per  1  tebibyte  of  storage
                 provisioned.  File  system  throughput  capacity  is equal to
                 Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).
                 This  option  is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2
                 deployment types.

                 Valid values:

                 o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                 o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                 o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000.

              MountName -> (string)
                 You use the MountName value when mounting the file system.

                 For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value is always  "fsx
                 ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                 types, this value is a string that is unique within an Amazon
                 Web Services Region.

              DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                 A  recurring  daily  time,  in  the  format HH:MM . HH is the
                 zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded
                 minute  of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

              AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting  this
                 property  to  0  disables  automatic  backups. You can retain
                 automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is  0
                 .

              CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                 A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system are
                 copied to backups. If it's set to true, all tags on the  file
                 system  are copied to all automatic backups and any user-ini-
                 tiated backups where the user doesn't specify  any  tags.  If
                 this  value  is  true, and you specify one or more tags, only
                 the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify  one
                 or  more  tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags
                 are copied from the file system, regardless  of  this  value.
                 (Default = false)

              DriveCacheType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  drive  cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems
                 that are provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                 is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD. When set to READ the
                 file system has an SSD storage cache that is sized to 20%  of
                 the file system's storage capacity. This improves the perfor-
                 mance for frequently accessed files by caching up to  20%  of
                 the total storage capacity.

                 This parameter is required when StorageType is set to HDD.

              DataCompressionType -> (string)
                 The data compression configuration for the file system. Data-
                 CompressionType can have the following values:

                 o NONE - Data compression is turned off for the file  system.

                 o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm.

                 For more information, see Lustre data compression .

              LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The Lustre logging configuration. Lustre logging  writes  the
                 enabled  log events for your file system to Amazon CloudWatch
                 Logs.

                 Level -> (string)

                     o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                     o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                     o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events and error events are
                       logged.

                     o DISABLED - logging of data repository events is  turned
                       off.

                 Destination -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the desti-
                     nation of the logs. The destination  can  be  any  Amazon
                     CloudWatch  Logs  log group ARN. The destination ARN must
                     be in the same Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon  Web
                     Services  Region, and Amazon Web Services account as your
                     Amazon FSx file system.

          AdministrativeActions -> (list)
              A list of administrative actions for the file system that are in
              process  or  waiting  to  be  processed.  Administrative actions
              describe changes to the Amazon FSx system that you  have  initi-
              ated using the UpdateFileSystem operation.

              (structure)
                 Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for the
                 current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file system.

                 AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                     Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system  update  administra-
                       tive  action initiated from the Amazon FSx console, API
                       (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI (update-file-system ).

                     o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                       task  to  increase a file system's storage capacity has
                       been  completed  successfully,  a  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION
                       task starts.

                       o For  Windows  and  ONTAP, storage optimization is the
                         process of migrating the file system  data  to  newer
                         larger disks.

                       o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists of rebal-
                         ancing the data across the existing and  newly  added
                         file servers.

                     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
                     ProgressPercent property. When  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  has
                     been   completed   successfully,   the  parent  FILE_SYS-
                     TEM_UPDATE action status changes to COMPLETED . For  more
                     information,  see Managing storage capacity in the Amazon

                       to  disassociate  a DNS alias from the file system. For
                       more information, see DisassociateFileSystemAliases .

                     o VOLUME_UPDATE - A volume update to an  Amazon  FSx  for
                       NetApp ONTAP or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume initiated
                       from the Amazon FSx console, API  (UpdateVolume  ),  or
                       CLI (update-volume ).

                     o SNAPSHOT_UPDATE  -  A  snapshot update to an Amazon FSx
                       for OpenZFS volume initiated from the Amazon  FSx  con-
                       sole, API (UpdateSnapshot ), or CLI (update-snapshot ).

                     o RELEASE_NFS_V3_LOCKS - Tracks the  release  of  Network
                       File System (NFS) V3 locks on an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS
                       file system.

                 ProgressPercent -> (integer)

                        file server subnet identified in the PreferredSubnetID
                        property.  All other file systems have only one subnet
                        ID.

                        For FSx for Lustre file systems, and Single-AZ Windows
                        file  systems,  this is the ID of the subnet that con-
                        tains the file system's endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1  Win-
                        dows  and ONTAP file systems, the file system endpoint
                        is available in the PreferredSubnetID .

                            system  should  be  copied  to backups. This value
                            defaults to false. If it's set to true,  all  tags
                            on  the  file  system  are copied to all automatic
                            backups and any user-initiated backups  where  the
                            user  doesn't  specify  any tags. If this value is
                            true, and you specify one or more tags,  only  the
                            specified tags are copied to backups. If you spec-
                            ify one or more tags when creating  a  user-initi-
                            ated backup, no tags are copied from the file sys-
                            tem, regardless of this value.

                        Aliases -> (list)
                            An array of one or more DNS aliases that are  cur-

                            Aliases allow you to use  existing  DNS  names  to
                            access  the  data  in your Amazon FSx file system.
                            You can associate up to 50  aliases  with  a  file
                            system  at  any time. You can associate additional
                            DNS aliases after you create the file system using
                            the  AssociateFileSystemAliases operation. You can
                            remove DNS aliases from the file system  after  it
                            is created using the DisassociateFileSystemAliases
                            operation. You only need to specify the alias name
                            in  the request payload. For more information, see

                               system.  You  can  use  a DNS alias to access a
                               file system using user-defined  DNS  names,  in
                               addition  to  the  default DNS name that Amazon
                               FSx assigns to the file system. For more infor-

                            Lifecycle -> (string)
                               Describes the state of  the  file  system's  S3
                               durable  data  repository,  if it is configured
                               with an S3 repository. The lifecycle  can  have
                               the following values:

                               o CREATING  - The data repository configuration
                                 between the FSx file system and the linked S3
                                 data  repository  is  being created. The data
                                 repository is unavailable.

                               o AVAILABLE - The data repository is  available
                                 for use.

                               o MISCONFIGURED  -  Amazon FSx cannot automati-
                                 cally import updates from the S3 bucket until
                                 the  data  repository  configuration  is cor-
                                 rected.    For    more    information,    see
                                 Troubleshooting  a  Misconfigured  linked  S3
                                 bucket .

                               o UPDATING - The data repository is  undergoing
                                 a  customer initiated update and availability
                                 may be impacted.

                               o FAILED - The data repository is in a terminal
                                 state that cannot be recovered.

                            ImportPath -> (string)
                               The  import  path  to the Amazon S3 bucket (and
                               optional prefix) that you're using as the  data
                               repository for your FSx for Lustre file system,
                               for example  s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix
                               .  If a prefix is specified after the Amazon S3
                               bucket name, only object keys with that  prefix
                               are loaded into the file system.

                            ExportPath -> (string)
                               The  export  path  to the Amazon S3 bucket (and
                               prefix) that you are using  to  store  new  and
                               changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                            ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                               For files imported from a data repository, this
                               value determines the stripe count  and  maximum
                               amount  of  data  per file (in MiB) stored on a
                               single physical disk.  The  maximum  number  of
                               disks  that a single file can be striped across
                               is limited by the total number  of  disks  that
                               make up the file system.

                               The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and
                               can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon
                               S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                            AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                               Describes  the  file  system's  linked  S3 data
                               repository's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoImport-
                               Policy  configures  how  Amazon  FSx keeps your
                               file and directory listings up to date  as  you
                               add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket.
                               AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

                               o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport is off. Amazon
                                 FSx only updates file and directory  listings
                                 from  the linked S3 bucket when the file sys-
                                 tem is created. FSx does not update file  and
                                 directory  listings  for  any  new or changed
                                 objects after choosing this option.

                               o NEW - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx  automati-
                                 cally  imports  directory listings of any new
                                 objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do
                                 not currently exist in the FSx file system.

                               o NEW_CHANGED  -  AutoImport  is on. Amazon FSx
                                 automatically  imports  file  and   directory
                                 listings  of  any new objects added to the S3
                                 bucket and  any  existing  objects  that  are
                                 changed  in  the  S3  bucket after you choose
                                 this option.

                               o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport is on.  Ama-
                                 zon FSx automatically imports file and direc-
                                 tory listings of any new objects added to the
                                 S3  bucket,  any  existing  objects  that are
                                 changed in the S3  bucket,  and  any  objects
                                 that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                            FailureDetails -> (structure)
                               Provides  detailed  information  about the data
                               respository if its Lifecycle is set to  MISCON-
                               FIGURED or FAILED .

                               Message -> (string)
                                   A detailed error message.

                        DeploymentType -> (string)
                            The  deployment  type  of  the FSx for Lustre file
                            system. Scratch deployment type  is  designed  for
                            temporary  storage  and shorter-term processing of
                            data.
                               SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2  deployment  types  are
                               best suited for when you need temporary storage
                               and  shorter-term  processing  of   data.   The
                               SCRATCH_2  deployment  type provides in-transit
                               encryption of data and higher burst  throughput
                               capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                            The  PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment type
                            is used for longer-term storage and workloads  and
                            encryption  of  data  in  transit. PERSISTENT_2 is
                            built on Lustre v2.12 and offers  higher  PerUnit-
                            StorageThroughput (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB) along with
                            a lower minimum storage capacity requirement  (600
                            GiB).  To  learn more about FSx for Lustre deploy-
                            ment types, see FSx for Lustre deployment  options
                            .

                            The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                        PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                            Per   unit   storage   throughput  represents  the
                            megabytes per second of read or  write  throughput
                            per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system
                            throughput capacity is equal to  Storage  capacity
                            (TiB)  * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). This
                            option is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and  PERSIS-
                            TENT_2 deployment types.

                            Valid values:

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                            o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD  storage:  125, 250, 500,
                              1000.

                        MountName -> (string)
                            You use the MountName value when mounting the file
                            system.

                            For  the  SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value is
                            always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 ,  and
                            PERSISTENT_2  deployment  types,  this  value is a
                            string that is unique within an  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                            vices Region.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            A  recurring  daily time, in the format HH:MM . HH
                            is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and  MM
                            is  the  zero-padded minute of the hour. For exam-
                            ple, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                        AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                            The number of days to  retain  automatic  backups.
                            Setting  this  property  to  0  disables automatic
                            backups. You can retain automatic  backups  for  a
                            maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file
                            system are copied to backups. If it's set to true,
                            all  tags  on  the  file  system are copied to all
                            automatic backups and any  user-initiated  backups
                            where  the  user doesn't specify any tags. If this
                            value is true, and you specify one or  more  tags,
                            only  the specified tags are copied to backups. If
                            you specify one  or  more  tags  when  creating  a
                            user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the
                            file system, regardless of this value. (Default  =

                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For Lustre, storage  optimization  consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-

                                      The  configured  size  of the volume, in
                                      megabytes (MBs).

                                   StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                                      The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                      The  ID  of the volume's storage virtual
                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                   TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                                      The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                                      CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                                          Specifies  the  number  of days that
                                          user data in a  volume  must  remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity
                                          pool.  Used  with the AUTO and SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY tiering policies. Enter  a
                                          whole  number  between  2  and  183.
                                          Default values are 31 days for  AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition data.  Default  value  is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO  -  moves  cold user data and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool
                                            storage  tier based on your access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing  it  from  being  moved to the
                                            capacity pool tier.

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The volume's universally unique  identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster occurs,  you  can  use  these
                                        data-protection   mirror   copies   to
                                        recover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume.  A load-sharing mirror reduces
                                        the network traffic to a FlexVol  vol-
                                        ume  by providing additional read-only
                                        access to clients.

                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services resources. We require an ARN  when
                                   you  need  to  specify a resource unambigu-
                                   ously across all of  Amazon  Web  Services.
                                   For  more  information, see Amazon Resource

                                      resource tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue
                                          ,  the  value assigned to the corre-
                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a  key-value  pair  in  a tag set of
                                          finances : April and also of payroll
                                          : April .

                                   The reason why the volume lifecycle  status
                                   changed.

                                   Message -> (string)
                                      A detailed error message.

                                      volume.   For   example,  fsx/parentVol-
                                      ume/volume1 .

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to  reserve  from the parent volume. You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The  maximum amount of storage in gibib-
                                      tyes (GiB) that the volume can use  from
                                      its  parent.  You  can  specify  a quota
                                      larger than the storage  on  the  parent
                                      volume.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The  method used to compress the data on
                                      the volume. Unless a compression type is
                                      specified,  volumes inherit the DataCom-
                                      pressionType value of their parent  vol-
                                      ume.

                                      o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress the data on
                                        the volume.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume  using  the  Zstandard (ZSTD) com-
                                        pression  algorithm.  This   algorithm
                                        reduces  the  amount  of space used on
                                        your volume and has very little impact
                                        on compute resources.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object that  specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given  resource. ARNs uniquely iden-
                                          tify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                                          We  require  an ARN when you need to
                                          specify  a  resource   unambiguously

                                          The strategy used when copying  data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE - The new volume  references
                                            the  data  in the origin snapshot.
                                            Cloning a snapshot is faster  than
                                            copying  the  data from a snapshot
                                            to a new volume and  doesn't  con-

                                            origin snapshot can't  be  deleted
                                            if  there  is  a  volume using its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY - Copies all  data  from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                            for the volume are copied to snapshots  where  the
                            user  doesn't  specify tags. If this value is true
                            and you specify one or more tags, only the  speci-
                            fied  tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify
                            one or more tags when creating  the  snapshot,  no
                            tags  are  copied  from  the volume, regardless of
                            this value.

                            identify which volumes to delete  before  you  can
                            delete the SVM.

                        TieringPolicy -> (structure)

                               a volume must remain inactive before it is con-
                               sidered  "cold" and moved to the capacity pool.
                               Used with the AUTO  and  SNAPSHOT_ONLY  tiering
                               policies.  Enter  a  whole number between 2 and
                               183. Default values are 31 days for AUTO and  2

                            Name -> (string)
                               Specifies the tiering policy used to transition
                               data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                               o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots  to  the
                                 capacity pool storage tier.

                               o AUTO  - moves cold user data and snapshots to
                                 the capacity pool storage tier based on  your
                                 access patterns.

                               o ALL  - moves all user data blocks in both the
                                 active file system and Snapshot copies to the
                                 storage pool tier.

                               o NONE  -  keeps a volume's data in the primary
                                 storage tier, preventing it from being  moved

                            following:

                            o RW  specifies  a  read/write  volume.  RW is the
                              default.

                            o DP specifies a data-protection volume.  You  can
                              protect  data  by replicating it to data-protec-
                              tion mirror copies. If a  disaster  occurs,  you
                              can  use  these data-protection mirror copies to
                              recover data.

                            o LS specifies a  load-sharing  mirror  volume.  A
                              load-sharing  mirror reduces the network traffic
                              to a  FlexVol  volume  by  providing  additional
                              read-only access to clients.

                     ResourceARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource.
                        ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                        We  require an ARN when you need to specify a resource
                        unambiguously across all of Amazon Web  Services.  For
                        more  information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
                        the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                     Tags -> (list)
                        A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

                               the  tag.  Tag  keys  must  be  unique  for the
                               resource to which they are attached.

                            Value -> (string)
                               A value that specifies the TagValue , the value
                               assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag val-
                               ues can be null and don't have to be unique  in
                               a   tag  set.  For  example,  you  can  have  a
                               key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April
                               and also of payroll : April .

                        system that you initiated.

                        (structure)
                            Describes a  specific  Amazon  FSx  administrative
                            action for the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS

                               o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION -  After  the  FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE  task  to increase a file system's
                                 storage capacity has been completed  success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using the ProgressPercent property. When  STOR-
                               AGE_OPTIMIZATION  has  been  completed success-
                               fully,  the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                               status changes to COMPLETED . For more informa-

                                   gle-AZ Windows file systems, this is the ID
                                   of  the  subnet that contains the file sys-
                                   tem's endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows  and
                                   ONTAP  file  systems,  the file system end-
                                   point is available in the PreferredSubnetID
                                   .

                                      FSx  file  system.  Aliases allow you to
                                      use existing DNS  names  to  access  the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can associate up to 50  aliases  with  a
                                      file  system  at any time. You can asso-
                                      ciate additional DNS aliases  after  you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You  can
                                      remove  DNS aliases from the file system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-

                                      need to specify the alias  name  in  the
                                      request  payload.  For more information,

                                   DeploymentType -> (string)
                                      The deployment type of the FSx for  Lus-
                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is designed for  temporary  storage  and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2 deployment
                                          types are best suited for  when  you
                                          need     temporary    storage    and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2  deployment  type provides
                                          in-transit encryption  of  data  and
                                          higher   burst  throughput  capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      The   PERSISTENT_1   and    PERSISTENT_2
                                      deployment  type is used for longer-term
                                      storage and workloads and encryption  of
                                      data  in  transit. PERSISTENT_2 is built
                                      on  Lustre  v2.12  and   offers   higher
                                      PerUnitStorageThroughput   (up  to  1000
                                      MB/s/TiB) along  with  a  lower  minimum
                                      storage  capacity requirement (600 GiB).

                                      HH:MM . HH is the  zero-padded  hour  of
                                      the   day   (0-23),   and   MM   is  the
                                      zero-padded  minute  of  the  hour.  For
                                      example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of days to retain automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 0 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      on the file system are copied  to  back-
                                      ups.  If  it's  set to true, all tags on
                                      the file system are copied to all  auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups where the user  doesn't  specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The  type of drive cache used by PERSIS-

                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is required  when  StorageType  is  HDD.
                                      When  set to READ the file system has an
                                      SSD storage cache that is sized  to  20%
                                      of  the  file system's storage capacity.
                                      This improves the performance  for  fre-
                                      quently  accessed files by caching up to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This parameter is  required  when  Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                      the file system. DataCompressionType can
                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE  - Data compression is turned off
                                        for the file system.

                                      o LZ4 - Data compression  is  turned  on
                                        with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                   FlexCacheEndpointType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the FlexCache endpoint type of
                                      the volume. Valid values are the follow-
                                      ing:

                                      o NONE specifies that the volume doesn't
                                        have a FlexCache  configuration.  NONE
                                        is the default.

                                      o ORIGIN  specifies  that  the volume is
                                        the origin volume for a FlexCache vol-

                                      work-attached  storage (NAS) clients use
                                      to mount  the  volume,  along  with  the
                                      storage  virtual  machine  (SVM)  Domain
                                      Name System (DNS) name  or  IP  address.
                                      You  can  create a JunctionPath directly
                                      below a parent volume junction or  on  a
                                      directory  within  a volume. A Junction-
                                      Path for a volume named  vol3  might  be
                                      /vol1/vol2/vol3  ,  or /vol1/dir2/vol3 ,
                                      or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                                   SecurityStyle -> (string)
                                      The security style for the volume, which
                                      can be UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                                   SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                      The  configured  size  of the volume, in
                                      megabytes (MBs).

                                   StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                                      The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                      The  ID  of the volume's storage virtual
                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                          user data in a  volume  must  remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity
                                          pool.  Used  with the AUTO and SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY tiering policies. Enter  a
                                          whole  number  between  2  and  183.
                                          Default values are 31 days for  AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition data.  Default  value  is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO  -  moves  cold user data and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool

                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing  it  from  being  moved to the
                                            capacity pool tier.

                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      its  parent.  You  can  specify  a quota
                                      larger than the storage  on  the  parent
                                      volume.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The  method used to compress the data on
                                      the volume. Unless a compression type is
                                      specified,  volumes inherit the DataCom-
                                      pressionType value of their parent  vol-
                                      ume.

                                      o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress the data on
                                        the volume.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume  using  the  Zstandard (ZSTD) com-
                                        pression  algorithm.  This   algorithm
                                        reduces  the  amount  of space used on
                                        your volume and has very little impact
                                        on compute resources.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object that  specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given  resource. ARNs uniquely iden-
                                          tify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                                          We  require  an ARN when you need to
                                          specify  a  resource   unambiguously
                                          across  all  of Amazon Web Services.

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The strategy used when copying  data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE - The new volume  references
                                            the  data  in the origin snapshot.
                                            Cloning a snapshot is faster  than
                                            copying  the  data from a snapshot
                                            to a new volume and  doesn't  con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin snapshot can't  be  deleted
                                            if  there  is  a  volume using its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY - Copies all  data  from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  value indicating whether the
                                      volume is read-only.

                                   o PENDING  - Amazon FSx hasn't started cre-
                                     ating the snapshot.

                                   o CREATING - Amazon  FSx  is  creating  the
                                     snapshot.

                                   o DELETING  -  Amazon  FSx  is deleting the
                                     snapshot.

                                   o AVAILABLE - The snapshot is fully  avail-
                                     able.

                               Tags -> (list)

                                      Specifies  a  key-value   pair   for   a
                                      resource tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue
                                          ,  the  value assigned to the corre-
                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a  key-value  pair  in  a tag set of
                                          finances : April and also of payroll
                                          : April .

                     OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The configuration of an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume.

                        ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                            The ID of the parent volume.

                        VolumePath -> (string)
                            The path to the volume from the root  volume.  For
                            example, fsx/parentVolume/volume1 .

                        StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of  storage  in  gibibytes  (GiB)  to
                            reserve from the parent volume. You can't  reserve
                            more  storage than the parent volume has reserved.

                        StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                            The maximum amount of storage in  gibibtyes  (GiB)
                            that  the  volume can use from its parent. You can
                            specify a quota larger than  the  storage  on  the
                            parent volume.

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            The  method  used to compress the data on the vol-
                            ume. Unless a compression type is specified,  vol-
                            umes  inherit  the  DataCompressionType  value  of
                            their parent volume.

                            o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the  volume.

                            o ZSTD  -  Compresses the data in the volume using
                              the Zstandard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. This
                              algorithm  reduces  the  amount of space used on
                              your volume and has very little impact  on  com-
                              pute resources.

                        CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value  indicating whether tags for the
                            volume should be copied to snapshots.  This  value
                            defaults to false . If it's set to true , all tags
                            for the volume are copied to snapshots  where  the
                            user  doesn't  specify tags. If this value is true
                            and you specify one or more tags, only the  speci-
                            fied  tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify
                            one or more tags when creating  the  snapshot,  no
                            tags  are  copied  from  the volume, regardless of
                            this value.

                        OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                            The configuration object that specifies the  snap-
                            shot to use as the origin of the data for the vol-
                            ume.

                            SnapshotARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given
                               resource.  ARNs  uniquely  identify  Amazon Web
                               Services resources. We require an ARN when  you
                               need to specify a resource unambiguously across
                               all of Amazon Web Services. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
                               Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                            CopyStrategy -> (string)
                               The strategy used when copying  data  from  the
                               snapshot to the new volume.

                               o CLONE - The new volume references the data in
                                 the origin snapshot. Cloning  a  snapshot  is
                                 faster  than copying the data from a snapshot
                                 to a new  volume  and  doesn't  consume  disk
                                 throughput.   However,  the  origin  snapshot
                                 can't be deleted if there is a  volume  using
                                 its copied data.

                               o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot
                                 to the new volume.

                        ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value indicating whether the  volume  is
                            read-only.

                        NfsExports -> (list)
                            The  configuration  object  for mounting a Network
                            File System (NFS) file system.

                            (structure)
                               The Network File System NFS) configurations for
                               mounting an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                               ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                                   A list of configuration objects  that  con-
                                   tain  the  client  and options for mounting
                                   the OpenZFS file system.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies who can mount the file  system
                                      and  the  options that can be used while
                                      mounting the file system.

                                      Clients -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies who can mount
                                          the  file  system. You can provide a
                                          wildcard  character  (*  ),  an   IP
                                          address   (0.0.0.0   ),  or  a  CIDR
                                          address (192.0.2.0/24 . By  default,
                                          Amazon FSx uses the wildcard charac-
                                          ter when specifying the client.

                                      Options -> (list)
                                          The options to use when mounting the
                                          file  system.  For a list of options
                                          that you can use with  Network  File
                                          System  (NFS),  see the exports(5) -
                                          Linux man page . When choosing  your
                                          options, consider the following:

                                          o crossmount  is used by default. If
                                            you don't specify crossmount  when
                                            changing the client configuration,
                                            you won't be able to see or access
                                            snapshots  in  your  file system's
                                            snapshot directory.

                                          o sync is used by  default.  If  you
                                            instead specify async , the system
                                            acknowledges writes before writing
                                            to  disk.  If  the  system crashes
                                            before the  writes  are  finished,
                                            you lose the unwritten data.

                               or group can use on the volume.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   A  value  that  specifies whether the quota
                                   applies to a user or group.

                               Id -> (integer)
                                   The ID of the user or group.

                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource.
                        ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                        We  require an ARN when you need to specify a resource
                        unambiguously across all of Amazon Web  Services.  For
                        more  information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
                        the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                     Lifecycle -> (string)
                        The lifecycle status of the snapshot.

                        o PENDING - Amazon FSx  hasn't  started  creating  the
                          snapshot.

                        o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the snapshot.

                        o DELETING - Amazon FSx is deleting the snapshot.

                               the tag.  Tag  keys  must  be  unique  for  the
                               resource to which they are attached.

                            Value -> (string)

                        that are in process or waiting to be processed. Admin-
                        istrative actions describe changes to the  Amazon  FSx
                        system.

                        (structure)
                            Describes  a  specific  Amazon  FSx administrative
                            action for the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS
                            file system.

                            AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                               Describes the type of administrative action, as
                               follows:

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE -  A  file  system  update
                                 administrative action initiated from the Ama-
                                 zon FSx console, API (UpdateFileSystem ),  or
                                 CLI (update-file-system ).

                               o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE task to increase a  file  system's
                                 storage  capacity has been completed success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For Lustre, storage  optimization  consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-
                               AGE_OPTIMIZATION has  been  completed  success-

                                   of the subnet that contains the  file  sys-
                                   tem's  endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows and
                                   ONTAP file systems, the  file  system  end-
                                   point is available in the PreferredSubnetID
                                   .

                                   (string)
                                      The ID for a subnet. A subnet is a range

                                   sible. The  elastic  network  interface  is
                                   automatically  created  in the same virtual
                                   private cloud (VPC)  that  the  Amazon  FSx
                                   file system was created in. For more infor-

                                      backups.  Setting  this  to  0  disables
                                      automatic  backups. You can retain auto-
                                      matic backups for a maximum of 90  days.

                                      backups.  This  value defaults to false.
                                      If it's set to true,  all  tags  on  the
                                      file  system are copied to all automatic
                                      backups and any  user-initiated  backups
                                      where the user doesn't specify any tags.
                                      If this value is true, and  you  specify
                                      one  or  more  tags,  only the specified
                                      tags are copied to backups. If you spec-
                                      ify  one  or  more  tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   Aliases -> (list)
                                      An array of one or more DNS aliases that
                                      are currently associated with the Amazon
                                      FSx file system. Aliases  allow  you  to
                                      use  existing  DNS  names  to access the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can  associate  up  to 50 aliases with a
                                      file system at any time. You  can  asso-
                                      ciate  additional  DNS aliases after you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can
                                      remove DNS aliases from the file  system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need  to  specify  the alias name in the
                                      request payload. For  more  information,

                                          the file system. You can use  a  DNS
                                          alias  to access a file system using
                                          user-defined DNS names, in  addition
                                          to  the default DNS name that Amazon
                                          FSx assigns to the file system.  For

                                      ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                                          For  files  imported  from  a   data
                                          repository,  this  value  determines
                                          the stripe count and maximum  amount
                                          of  data per file (in MiB) stored on
                                          a single physical disk. The  maximum
                                          number  of  disks that a single file
                                          can be striped across is limited  by
                                          the  total number of disks that make
                                          up the file system.

                                          The default chunk size is 1,024  MiB
                                          (1  GiB)  and  can  go  as  high  as
                                          512,000 MiB  (500  GiB).  Amazon  S3
                                          objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                                            linked S3  bucket  when  the  file
                                            system  is  created.  FSx does not
                                            update file and directory listings
                                            for  any  new  or  changed objects
                                            after choosing this option.

                                          o NEW - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx
                                            automatically   imports  directory

                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is  designed  for  temporary storage and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                          types  are  best suited for when you
                                          need    temporary    storage     and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The number of days to  retain  automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 0 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)

                                      on  the  file system are copied to back-
                                      ups. If it's set to true,  all  tags  on
                                      the  file system are copied to all auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups  where  the user doesn't specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)

                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD.
                                      When set to READ the file system has  an
                                      SSD  storage  cache that is sized to 20%
                                      of the file system's  storage  capacity.
                                      This  improves  the performance for fre-
                                      quently accessed files by caching up  to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This  parameter  is  required when Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                      backups. If it's set to true , all  tags
                                      on  the  file  system  are copied to all
                                      automatic backups and any user-initiated
                                      backups  where  the user doesn't specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true and  you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are

                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are copied to  snapshots  where  the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is true and  you  specify  one  or  more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are copied from the  volume,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume on an SVM can be  the  root  volume.
                                      This  value  defaults to false . If this
                                      value is true , then  this  is  the  SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an SVM, because you  must  first  delete
                                      all  non-root  volumes.  This flag, when
                                      set to false , helps you identify  which
                                      volumes  to delete before you can delete
                                      the SVM.

                                   TieringPolicy -> (structure)

                                      CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                                          Specifies the number  of  days  that
                                          user  data  in  a volume must remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold"  and  moved  to  the capacity
                                          pool. Used with the AUTO  and  SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY  tiering policies. Enter a
                                          whole  number  between  2  and  183.
                                          Default  values are 31 days for AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition  data.  Default  value is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves  cold  snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO - moves cold  user  data  and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool
                                            storage tier based on your  access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL  -  moves all user data blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE - keeps a  volume's  data  in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing it from  being  moved  to  the
                                            capacity pool tier.

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The  volume's universally unique identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster  occurs,  you  can  use these
                                        data-protection   mirror   copies   to
                                        recover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume. A load-sharing mirror  reduces
                                        the  network traffic to a FlexVol vol-
                                        ume by providing additional  read-only
                                        access to clients.

                               ResourceARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given
                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services  resources. We require an ARN when
                                   you need to specify  a  resource  unambigu-
                                   ously  across  all  of Amazon Web Services.
                                   For more information, see  Amazon  Resource
                                   Names  (ARNs)  in  the  Amazon Web Services

                               Tags -> (list)
                                   A list of Tag values, with a maximum of  50
                                   elements.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies   a   key-value   pair  for  a
                                      resource tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the TagKey  ,
                                          the  name  of the tag. Tag keys must
                                          be unique for the resource to  which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagValue
                                          , the value assigned to  the  corre-
                                          sponding  tag key. Tag values can be
                                          null and don't have to be unique  in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a key-value pair in  a  tag  set  of
                                          finances : April and also of payroll
                                          : April .

                               LifecycleTransitionReason -> (structure)
                                   The  reason why the volume lifecycle status
                                   changed.

                                   Message -> (string)
                                      A detailed error message.

                               OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  of  an  Amazon  FSx  for
                                   OpenZFS volume.

                                   ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                                      The ID of the parent volume.

                                   VolumePath -> (string)
                                      The  path  to  the  volume from the root
                                      volume.  For   example,   fsx/parentVol-
                                      ume/volume1 .

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to reserve from the parent  volume.  You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The maximum amount of storage in  gibib-
                                      tyes  (GiB) that the volume can use from
                                      its parent.  You  can  specify  a  quota
                                      larger  than  the  storage on the parent
                                      volume.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The method used to compress the data  on
                                      the volume. Unless a compression type is
                                      specified, volumes inherit the  DataCom-
                                      pressionType  value of their parent vol-
                                      ume.

                                      o NONE - Doesn't compress  the  data  on
                                        the volume.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  Zstandard  (ZSTD)  com-
                                        pression   algorithm.  This  algorithm
                                        reduces the amount of  space  used  on
                                        your volume and has very little impact
                                        on compute resources.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are copied to  snapshots  where  the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is true and  you  specify  one  or  more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are copied from the  volume,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration object that specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given resource. ARNs uniquely  iden-
                                          tify  Amazon Web Services resources.
                                          We require an ARN when you  need  to
                                          specify   a  resource  unambiguously
                                          across all of Amazon  Web  Services.

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The  strategy used when copying data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE  - The new volume references
                                            the data in the  origin  snapshot.
                                            Cloning  a snapshot is faster than
                                            copying the data from  a  snapshot
                                            to  a  new volume and doesn't con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the

                 A  Boolean  value  indicating whether tags on the file system
                 should be copied to backups. If it's set to true ,  all  tags
                 on  the  file  system are copied to all automatic backups and
                 any user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify any
                 tags. If this value is true and you specify one or more tags,
                 only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify
                 one  or  more  tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no
                 tags are copied from the  file  system,  regardless  of  this

                 it's  set  to  true  ,  all tags for the volume are copied to
                 snapshots where the user doesn't specify tags. If this  value
                 is  true and you specify one or more tags, only the specified
                 tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify one or more tags
                 when  creating the snapshot, no tags are copied from the vol-
                 ume, regardless of this value.

              DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                 A recurring daily time, in the  format  HH:MM  .  HH  is  the

                 capacity, but you can provision additional  IOPS  per  GB  of
                 storage.  The  configuration  consists of the total number of
                 provisioned SSD IOPS and how the amount was  provisioned  (by
                 the customer or by the system).

                 Mode -> (string)
                     Specifies  whether the number of IOPS for the file system
                     is using the system default (AUTOMATIC )  or  was  provi-
                     sioned by the customer (USER_PROVISIONED ).

                 Iops -> (long)
