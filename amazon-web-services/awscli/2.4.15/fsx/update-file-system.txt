SYNOPSIS
            update-file-system
          --file-system-id <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--storage-capacity <value>]
          [--windows-configuration <value>]
          [--lustre-configuration <value>]
          [--ontap-configuration <value>]
          [--open-zfs-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system that you are updating.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure
          idempotent updates. This string  is  automatically  filled  on  your
          behalf  when  you  use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon
          Web Services SDK.

       --storage-capacity (integer)
          Use this parameter to increase the storage capacity of an Amazon FSx
          for  Windows  File  Server, Amazon FSx for Lustre, or Amazon FSx for
          NetApp ONTAP file system.  Specifies  the  storage  capacity  target
          value,  in GiB, to increase the storage capacity for the file system
          that you're updating.

          NOTE:
              You can't make a storage capacity increase request if  there  is
              an existing storage capacity increase request in progress.

          For  Windows file systems, the storage capacity target value must be
          at least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value.
          To  increase storage capacity, the file system must have at least 16
          MBps of throughput capacity.  For  more  information,  see  Managing
          storage  capacity  in  the  Amazon  FSx for Windows File Server User
          Guide .

          For Lustre file systems, the storage capacity target  value  can  be
          the following:

          o For  SCRATCH_2  ,  PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 SSD deployment
            types, valid values are in multiples of 2400 GiB. The  value  must
            be greater than the current storage capacity.

          o For  PERSISTENT  HDD  file  systems, valid values are multiples of
            6000 GiB for 12-MBps throughput per TiB file systems and multiples
            of  1800 GiB for 40-MBps throughput per TiB file systems. The val-
            ues must be greater than the current storage capacity.

          o For SCRATCH_1 file systems, you can't increase the storage  capac-
            ity.

          For  more  information, see Managing storage and throughput capacity
          in the Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide .

          For ONTAP file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at
          least  10  percent  greater than the current storage capacity value.
          For more information, see Managing storage capacity and  provisioned
          IOPS in the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

              nance,  formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone. d is the weekday
              number, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending  with
              Sunday.

          DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
              A  recurring  daily  time,  in  the  format  HH:MM  .  HH is the
              zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM  is  the  zero-padded
              minute of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

          AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
              The  number  of  days  to retain automatic backups. Setting this
              property to 0 disables automatic backups. You can  retain  auto-
              matic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

          AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
              (Optional)  When  you  create your file system, your existing S3
              objects appear as file and directory listings. Use this property
              to  choose  how Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory listing
              up to date as you add  or  modify  objects  in  your  linked  S3
              bucket. AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

              o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates
                file and directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the
                file  system  is  created.  FSx  does  not update the file and
                directory listing for any new or changed objects after  choos-
                ing this option.

              o NEW  -  AutoImport  is  on.  Amazon  FSx automatically imports
                directory listings of any new objects added to the  linked  S3
                bucket that do not currently exist in the FSx file system.

              o NEW_CHANGED  -  AutoImport  is  on.  Amazon  FSx automatically
                imports file and directory listings of any new  objects  added
                to  the S3 bucket and any existing objects that are changed in
                the S3 bucket after you choose this option.

              o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport is on. Amazon  FSx  automati-
                cally  imports  file and directory listings of any new objects
                added to the S3 bucket, any existing objects that are  changed
                in  the S3 bucket, and any objects that were deleted in the S3
                bucket.

              The AutoImportPolicy parameter is not supported for Lustre  file
              systems  with  the Persistent_2 deployment type. Instead, use to
              update a data repository association on your  Persistent_2  file
              system.

          DataCompressionType -> (string)
              Sets  the  data  compression  configuration for the file system.
              DataCompressionType can have the following values:

              o NONE - Data compression is turned off for the file system.

              o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm.

              If you don't use DataCompressionType , the file  system  retains
              its current data compression configuration.

              For more information, see Lustre data compression .

          LogConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  Lustre  logging  configuration used when updating an Amazon
              FSx for Lustre file system. When logging is enabled, Lustre logs
              error  and  warning events for data repositories associated with
              your file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              Level -> (string)
                 Sets which data repository events are logged by Amazon FSx.

                 o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                 o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                 o WARN_ERROR - both  warning  events  and  error  events  are
                   logged.

                 o DISABLED - logging of data repository events is turned off.

              Destination -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the destination
                 of the logs.

                 The  destination  can be any Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group
                 ARN, with the following requirements:

                 o The destination ARN that you provide must be  in  the  same
                   Amazon  Web Services partition, Amazon Web Services Region,
                   and Amazon Web Services account as  your  Amazon  FSx  file
                   system.

                 o The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin
                   with the /aws/fsx prefix.

                 o If you do not provide a destination, Amazon FSx will create
                   and use a log stream in the CloudWatch Logs /aws/fsx/lustre
                   log group.

                 o If Destination is provided and the resource does not exist,
                   the request will fail with a BadRequest error.

                 o If Level is set to DISABLED , you cannot specify a destina-
                   tion in Destination .

       --open-zfs-configuration (structure)
          The configuration updates for an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

          AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
              The number of days to retain  automatic  backups.  Setting  this
              property  to  0 disables automatic backups. You can retain auto-
              matic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating whether  tags  for  the  file  system
              should  be  copied to backups. This value defaults to false . If
              it's set to true , all tags for the file system  are  copied  to
              all  automatic and user-initiated backups where the user doesn't
              specify tags. If this value is true and you specify one or  more
              tags,  only  the  specified  tags  are copied to backups. If you
              specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated  backup,
              no  tags  are  copied  from  the file system, regardless of this
              value.

          CopyTagsToVolumes -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume should be
              copied  to snapshots. This value defaults to false . If it's set
              to true , all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots  where
              the  user  doesn't  specify  tags. If this value is true and you
              specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied  to
              snapshots.  If  you  specify  one or more tags when creating the
              snapshot, no tags are copied from the volume, regardless of this
              value.

          DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
              A  recurring  daily  time,  in  the  format  HH:MM  .  HH is the
              zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM  is  the  zero-padded
              minute of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

          ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)
              The  throughput  of  an  Amazon  FSx  file  system,  measured in

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                 A  boolean  flag  indicating  whether tags on the file system
                 should be copied to backups. This value defaults to false. If
                 it's  set  to true, all tags on the file system are copied to
                 all automatic backups and any  user-initiated  backups  where
                 the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and
                 you specify one or more tags, only  the  specified  tags  are
                 copied  to backups. If you specify one or more tags when cre-
                 ating a user-initiated backup, no tags are  copied  from  the
                 file system, regardless of this value.

              Aliases -> (list)
                 An  array of one or more DNS aliases that are currently asso-
                 ciated with the Amazon FSx file system. Aliases allow you  to
                 use  existing DNS names to access the data in your Amazon FSx
                 file system. You can associate up to 50 aliases with  a  file
                 system  at any time. You can associate additional DNS aliases
                 after you create the file system using the  AssociateFileSys-
                 temAliases  operation.  You  can  remove DNS aliases from the
                 file system after  it  is  created  using  the  Disassociate-
                 FileSystemAliases  operation.  You  only  need to specify the
                 alias name in the request payload. For more information,  see
                 DNS aliases .

                 (structure)
                     A  DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You
                     can use a  DNS  alias  to  access  a  file  system  using
                     user-defined  DNS  names,  in addition to the default DNS
                     name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system. For more
                     information,  see DNS aliases in the FSx for Windows File
                     Server User Guide .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the DNS alias. The alias name has to  meet
                        the following requirements:

                        o Formatted  as  a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN),
                          hostname.domain  ,  for  example,   accounting.exam-
                          ple.com .

                        o Can  contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore
                          (_), and the hyphen (-).

                        o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                        o Can start with a numeric.

                        For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters
                        as  lowercase  letters  (a-z),  regardless  of how you
                        specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
                        or the corresponding letters in escape codes.

                     Lifecycle -> (string)
                        Describes the state of the DNS alias.

                        o AVAILABLE - The DNS alias is associated with an Ama-
                          zon FSx file system.

                        o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS alias  and
                          associating it with the file system.

                        o CREATE_FAILED  -  Amazon FSx was unable to associate
                          the DNS alias with the file system.

                        o DELETING - Amazon  FSx  is  disassociating  the  DNS
                          alias from the file system and deleting it.

                        o DELETE_FAILED  - Amazon FSx was unable to disassoci-
                          ate the DNS alias from the file system.

              AuditLogConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration that Amazon FSx  for  Windows  File  Server
                 uses  to  audit  and log user accesses of files, folders, and
                 file shares on the Amazon FSx for Windows  File  Server  file
                 system.

                 FileAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                     Sets  which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file
                     and folder accesses.

                     o SUCCESS_ONLY - only successful attempts to access files
                       or folders are logged.

                     o FAILURE_ONLY  - only failed attempts to access files or
                       folders are logged.

                     o SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE  -  both  successful  attempts  and
                       failed  attempts to access files or folders are logged.

                     o DISABLED - access auditing  of  files  and  folders  is
                       turned off.

                 FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                     Sets  which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file

                     o FAILURE_ONLY  -  only  failed  attempts  to access file
                       shares are logged.

                     o SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE  -  both  successful  attempts  and
                       failed attempts to access file shares are logged.

                     o DISABLED  -  access  auditing  of file shares is turned
                       off.

                 AuditLogDestination -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the destination of the
                     audit  logs. The destination can be any Amazon CloudWatch
                     Logs log group ARN or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose deliv-
                     ery stream ARN.

                     The  name  of  the  Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must
                     begin with the /aws/fsx prefix. The name  of  the  Amazon
                     Kinesis  Data  Firehouse  delivery stream must begin with
                     the aws-fsx prefix.

                     The destination ARN (either CloudWatch Logs log group  or
                     Kinesis  Data  Firehose  delivery  stream) must be in the
                     same Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon  Web  Services
                     Region,  and  Amazon  Web Services account as your Amazon
                     FSx file system.

          LustreConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.

              WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                 The preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance,  for-
                 matted  d:HH:MM  in the UTC time zone. Here, d is the weekday
                 number, from 1 through 7, beginning with  Monday  and  ending
                 with Sunday.

              DataRepositoryConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The data repository configuration object for Lustre file sys-
                 tems returned in the response of the CreateFileSystem  opera-
                 tion.

                 This  data  type  is  not supported for file systems with the
                 Persistent_2 deployment type. Instead, use .

                 Lifecycle -> (string)
                     Describes the state of the file system's S3 durable  data
                     repository,  if  it  is configured with an S3 repository.
                     The lifecycle can have the following values:

                     o CREATING - The data  repository  configuration  between
                       the  FSx  file system and the linked S3 data repository
                       is being created. The data repository is unavailable.

                     o AVAILABLE - The data repository is available for use.

                     o MISCONFIGURED - Amazon FSx cannot automatically  import
                       updates  from  the  S3 bucket until the data repository
                       configuration is corrected. For more  information,  see
                       Troubleshooting a Misconfigured linked S3 bucket .

                     o UPDATING - The data repository is undergoing a customer
                       initiated update and availability may be impacted.

                     o FAILED - The data repository is  in  a  terminal  state
                       that cannot be recovered.

                 ImportPath -> (string)
                     The  import  path  to  the Amazon S3 bucket (and optional
                     prefix) that you're using as the data repository for your
                     FSx    for    Lustre    file    system,    for    example
                     s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix . If a prefix is spec-
                     ified  after  the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys
                     with that prefix are loaded into the file system.

                 ExportPath -> (string)
                     The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that
                     you are using to store new and changed Lustre file system
                     files in S3.

                 ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                     For files imported from a  data  repository,  this  value
                     determines  the  stripe  count and maximum amount of data
                     per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical  disk.  The
                     maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped
                     across is limited by the total number of disks that  make
                     up the file system.

                     The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as
                     high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects  have  a
                     maximum size of 5 TB.

                 AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                     Describes  the  file system's linked S3 data repository's
                     AutoImportPolicy . The  AutoImportPolicy  configures  how
                     Amazon  FSx  keeps your file and directory listings up to
                     date as you add or  modify  objects  in  your  linked  S3
                     bucket. AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

                     o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport  is off. Amazon FSx only
                       updates file and directory listings from the linked  S3
                       bucket  when  the  file system is created. FSx does not
                       update file and  directory  listings  for  any  new  or
                       changed objects after choosing this option.

                     o NEW  -  AutoImport  is  on.  Amazon  FSx  automatically
                       imports directory listings of any new objects added  to
                       the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist in the
                       FSx file system.

                     o NEW_CHANGED - AutoImport is on.  Amazon  FSx  automati-
                       cally  imports  file  and directory listings of any new
                       objects added to the S3 bucket and any existing objects
                       that are changed in the S3 bucket after you choose this
                       option.

                     o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED -  AutoImport  is  on.  Amazon  FSx
                       automatically  imports  file  and directory listings of
                       any new objects added to the S3  bucket,  any  existing
                       objects  that  are  changed  in  the S3 bucket, and any
                       objects that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                 FailureDetails -> (structure)
                     Provides detailed information about the data  respository
                     if its Lifecycle is set to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                     Message -> (string)
                        A detailed error message.

              DeploymentType -> (string)
                 The  deployment  type  of  the  FSx  for  Lustre file system.
                 Scratch deployment type is designed for temporary storage and
                 shorter-term processing of data.
                     SCRATCH_1  and SCRATCH_2 deployment types are best suited
                     for when you need temporary storage and shorter-term pro-
                     cessing  of  data. The SCRATCH_2 deployment type provides
                     in-transit encryption of data and higher burst throughput
                     capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                 The PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment type is used for
                 longer-term storage and workloads and encryption of  data  in
                 transit.  PERSISTENT_2  is  built  on Lustre v2.12 and offers
                 higher PerUnitStorageThroughput (up to 1000  MB/s/TiB)  along
                 with  a lower minimum storage capacity requirement (600 GiB).
                 To learn more about FSx for Lustre deployment types, see  FSx
                 for Lustre deployment options .

                 The default is SCRATCH_1 .

              PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                 Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per sec-
                 ond of read or write throughput per  1  tebibyte  of  storage
                 provisioned.  File  system  throughput  capacity  is equal to
                 Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).
                 This  option  is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2
                 deployment types.

                 Valid values:

                 o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                 o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                 o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000.

              MountName -> (string)
                 You use the MountName value when mounting the file system.

                 For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value is always  "fsx
                 ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                 types, this value is a string that is unique within an Amazon
                 Web Services Region.

              DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                 A  recurring  daily  time,  in  the  format HH:MM . HH is the
                 zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded
                 minute  of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

              AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting  this
                 property  to  0  disables  automatic  backups. You can retain
                 automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is  0
                 .

              CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                 A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system are
                 copied to backups. If it's set to true, all tags on the  file
                 system  are copied to all automatic backups and any user-ini-
                 tiated backups where the user doesn't specify  any  tags.  If
                 this  value  is  true, and you specify one or more tags, only
                 the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify  one
                 or  more  tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags
                 are copied from the file system, regardless  of  this  value.
                 (Default = false)

              DriveCacheType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  drive  cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems
                 that are provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                 is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD. When set to READ the
                 file system has an SSD storage cache that is sized to 20%  of
                 the file system's storage capacity. This improves the perfor-
                 mance for frequently accessed files by caching up to  20%  of
                 the total storage capacity.

                 This parameter is required when StorageType is set to HDD.

              DataCompressionType -> (string)
                 The data compression configuration for the file system. Data-
                 CompressionType can have the following values:

                 o NONE - Data compression is turned off for the file  system.

                 o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm.

                 For more information, see Lustre data compression .

              LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The Lustre logging configuration. Lustre logging  writes  the
                 enabled  log events for your file system to Amazon CloudWatch
                 Logs.

                 Level -> (string)

                     be in the same Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon  Web
                     Services  Region, and Amazon Web Services account as your
                     Amazon FSx file system.

          AdministrativeActions -> (list)
              A list of administrative actions for the file system that are in
              process  or  waiting  to  be  processed.  Administrative actions
              describe changes to the Amazon FSx system that you  have  initi-
              ated using the UpdateFileSystem operation.

              (structure)
                 Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for the
                 current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file system.

                 AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                     Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system  update  administra-
                       tive  action initiated from the Amazon FSx console, API
                       (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI (update-file-system ).

                     o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                       task  to  increase a file system's storage capacity has
                       been  completed  successfully,  a  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION
                       task starts.

                       o For  Windows  and  ONTAP, storage optimization is the
                         process of migrating the file system  data  to  newer
                         larger disks.

                       o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists of rebal-
                         ancing the data across the existing and  newly  added
                         file servers.

                     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
                     ProgressPercent property. When  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  has
                     been   completed   successfully,   the  parent  FILE_SYS-
                     TEM_UPDATE action status changes to COMPLETED . For  more

                       more information, see DisassociateFileSystemAliases .

                     o VOLUME_UPDATE - A volume update to an  Amazon  FSx  for
                       NetApp ONTAP or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume initiated
                       from the Amazon FSx console, API  (UpdateVolume  ),  or
                       CLI (update-volume ).

                     o SNAPSHOT_UPDATE  -  A  snapshot update to an Amazon FSx
                       for OpenZFS volume initiated from the Amazon  FSx  con-
                       sole, API (UpdateSnapshot ), or CLI (update-snapshot ).

                     o RELEASE_NFS_V3_LOCKS - Tracks the  release  of  Network
                       File System (NFS) V3 locks on an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS

                            on  Linux  SMB clients or Windows SMB clients that
                            are not joined to a  Microsoft  Active  Directory.
                            Applicable  for all Windows file system deployment
                            types. This IP address is temporarily  unavailable
                            when  the  file  system is undergoing maintenance.
                            For Linux and Windows SMB clients that are  joined
                            to  an  Active  Directory,  use  the file system's
                            DNSName instead. For more information  on  mapping
                            and  mounting  file  shares,  see  Accessing  File

                            system  should  be  copied  to backups. This value
                            defaults to false. If it's set to true,  all  tags
                            on  the  file  system  are copied to all automatic
                            backups and any user-initiated backups  where  the
                            user  doesn't  specify  any tags. If this value is
                            true, and you specify one or more tags,  only  the
                            specified tags are copied to backups. If you spec-
                            ify one or more tags when creating  a  user-initi-
                            ated backup, no tags are copied from the file sys-
                            tem, regardless of this value.

                        Aliases -> (list)
                            An array of one or more DNS aliases that are  cur-
                            rently associated with the Amazon FSx file system.
                            Aliases allow you to use  existing  DNS  names  to
                            access  the  data  in your Amazon FSx file system.
                            You can associate up to 50  aliases  with  a  file
                            system  at  any time. You can associate additional
                            DNS aliases after you create the file system using
                            the  AssociateFileSystemAliases operation. You can
                            remove DNS aliases from the file system  after  it
                            is created using the DisassociateFileSystemAliases
                            operation. You only need to specify the alias name
                            in  the request payload. For more information, see
                            DNS aliases .

                               system.  You  can  use  a DNS alias to access a
                               file system using user-defined  DNS  names,  in
                               addition  to  the  default DNS name that Amazon
                               FSx assigns to the file system. For more infor-

                        DataRepositoryConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The data repository configuration object for  Lus-
                            tre  file  systems returned in the response of the
                            CreateFileSystem operation.

                            This data type is not supported for  file  systems
                            with  the  Persistent_2  deployment type. Instead,
                            use .

                            Lifecycle -> (string)
                               Describes the state of  the  file  system's  S3
                               durable  data  repository,  if it is configured
                               with an S3 repository. The lifecycle  can  have
                               the following values:

                               o CREATING  - The data repository configuration
                                 between the FSx file system and the linked S3
                                 data  repository  is  being created. The data
                                 repository is unavailable.

                               o AVAILABLE - The data repository is  available
                                 for use.

                               o MISCONFIGURED  -  Amazon FSx cannot automati-
                                 cally import updates from the S3 bucket until
                                 the  data  repository  configuration  is cor-
                                 rected.    For    more    information,    see

                                 bucket .

                               o UPDATING - The data repository is  undergoing
                                 a  customer initiated update and availability
                                 may be impacted.

                               o FAILED - The data repository is in a terminal
                                 state that cannot be recovered.

                            ImportPath -> (string)
                               The  import  path  to the Amazon S3 bucket (and
                               optional prefix) that you're using as the  data
                               repository for your FSx for Lustre file system,
                               for example  s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix
                               .  If a prefix is specified after the Amazon S3
                               bucket name, only object keys with that  prefix
                               are loaded into the file system.

                            ExportPath -> (string)
                               The  export  path  to the Amazon S3 bucket (and
                               prefix) that you are using  to  store  new  and
                               changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                            ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                               For files imported from a data repository, this
                               value determines the stripe count  and  maximum
                               amount  of  data  per file (in MiB) stored on a
                               single physical disk.  The  maximum  number  of
                               disks  that a single file can be striped across
                               is limited by the total number  of  disks  that
                               make up the file system.

                               The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and
                               can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon
                               S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                            AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                               Describes  the  file  system's  linked  S3 data
                               repository's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoImport-
                               Policy  configures  how  Amazon  FSx keeps your
                               file and directory listings up to date  as  you
                               add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket.
                               AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

                               o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport is off. Amazon
                                 FSx only updates file and directory  listings
                                 from  the linked S3 bucket when the file sys-
                                 tem is created. FSx does not update file  and
                                 directory  listings  for  any  new or changed
                                 objects after choosing this option.

                               o NEW - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx  automati-
                                 cally  imports  directory listings of any new
                                 objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do
                                 not currently exist in the FSx file system.

                               o NEW_CHANGED  -  AutoImport  is on. Amazon FSx
                                 automatically  imports  file  and   directory
                                 listings  of  any new objects added to the S3
                                 bucket and  any  existing  objects  that  are
                                 changed  in  the  S3  bucket after you choose
                                 this option.

                               o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport is on.  Ama-
                                 zon FSx automatically imports file and direc-
                                 tory listings of any new objects added to the
                                 S3  bucket,  any  existing  objects  that are
                                 changed in the S3  bucket,  and  any  objects
                                 that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                            FailureDetails -> (structure)
                               Provides  detailed  information  about the data
                               respository if its Lifecycle is set to  MISCON-
                               FIGURED or FAILED .

                               Message -> (string)
                                   A detailed error message.

                        DeploymentType -> (string)
                            The  deployment  type  of  the FSx for Lustre file
                            system. Scratch deployment type  is  designed  for
                            temporary  storage  and shorter-term processing of
                            data.
                               SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2  deployment  types  are
                               best suited for when you need temporary storage
                               and  shorter-term  processing  of   data.   The
                               SCRATCH_2  deployment  type provides in-transit
                               encryption of data and higher burst  throughput
                               capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                            The  PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment type
                            is used for longer-term storage and workloads  and
                            encryption  of  data  in  transit. PERSISTENT_2 is
                            built on Lustre v2.12 and offers  higher  PerUnit-
                            StorageThroughput (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB) along with
                            a lower minimum storage capacity requirement  (600
                            GiB).  To  learn more about FSx for Lustre deploy-
                            ment types, see FSx for Lustre deployment  options
                            .

                            The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                        PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                            Per   unit   storage   throughput  represents  the
                            megabytes per second of read or  write  throughput
                            per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system
                            throughput capacity is equal to  Storage  capacity
                            (TiB)  * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). This
                            option is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and  PERSIS-
                            TENT_2 deployment types.

                            Valid values:

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                            o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD  storage:  125, 250, 500,
                              1000.

                        MountName -> (string)
                            You use the MountName value when mounting the file
                            system.

                            For  the  SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value is
                            always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 ,  and
                            PERSISTENT_2  deployment  types,  this  value is a
                            string that is unique within an  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                            vices Region.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            A  recurring  daily time, in the format HH:MM . HH
                            is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and  MM
                            is  the  zero-padded minute of the hour. For exam-
                            ple, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                        AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                            The number of days to  retain  automatic  backups.
                            Setting  this  property  to  0  disables automatic
                            backups. You can retain automatic  backups  for  a
                            maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file
                            system are copied to backups. If it's set to true,
                            all  tags  on  the  file  system are copied to all
                            automatic backups and any  user-initiated  backups
                            where  the  user doesn't specify any tags. If this
                            value is true, and you specify one or  more  tags,
                            only  the specified tags are copied to backups. If
                            you specify one  or  more  tags  when  creating  a
                            user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the
                            file system, regardless of this value. (Default  =
                            false)

                        DriveCacheType -> (string)
                            The  type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file
                            systems that  are  provisioned  with  HDD  storage
                            devices.  This  parameter  is  required when Stor-
                            ageType is HDD. When set to READ the  file  system
                            has  an  SSD storage cache that is sized to 20% of
                            the file system's storage capacity. This  improves
                            the  performance  for frequently accessed files by
                            caching up to 20% of the total storage capacity.

                            This parameter is required when StorageType is set
                            to HDD.

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            The  data  compression  configuration for the file
                            system. DataCompressionType can have the following
                            values:

                            o NONE  -  Data  compression is turned off for the
                              file system.

                            o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4
                              algorithm.

                            For  more information, see Lustre data compression
                            .

                        LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The Lustre logging configuration.  Lustre  logging
                            writes the enabled log events for your file system
                            to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                            Level -> (string)
                               The data repository events that are  logged  by
                               Amazon FSx.

                               o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                               o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                               o WARN_ERROR  -  both  warning events and error
                                 events are logged.

                               o DISABLED - logging of data repository  events
                                 is turned off.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that specifies
                               the destination of the  logs.  The  destination
                               can  be  any  Amazon  CloudWatch Logs log group
                               ARN. The destination ARN must be  in  the  same

                        istrative  actions  describe changes to the Amazon FSx
                        system that  you  have  initiated  using  the  Update-
                        FileSystem operation.

                        (structure)
                            Describes  a  specific  Amazon  FSx administrative
                            action for the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS
                            file system.

                            AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                               Describes the type of administrative action, as
                               follows:

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE -  A  file  system  update
                                 administrative action initiated from the Ama-
                                 zon FSx console, API (UpdateFileSystem ),  or
                                 CLI (update-file-system ).

                               o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE task to increase a  file  system's
                                 storage  capacity has been completed success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For Lustre, storage  optimization  consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-
                               AGE_OPTIMIZATION has  been  completed  success-
                               fully,  the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                               status changes to COMPLETED . For more informa-

                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                          Specifies  the  number  of days that
                                          user data in a  volume  must  remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity
                                          pool.  Used  with the AUTO and SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY tiering policies. Enter  a
                                          whole  number  between  2  and  183.
                                          Default values are 31 days for  AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition data.  Default  value  is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO  -  moves  cold user data and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool
                                            storage  tier based on your access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing  it  from  being  moved to the
                                            capacity pool tier.

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The volume's universally unique  identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster occurs,  you  can  use  these
                                        data-protection   mirror   copies   to
                                        recover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume.  A load-sharing mirror reduces
                                        the network traffic to a FlexVol  vol-
                                        ume  by providing additional read-only
                                        access to clients.

                               ResourceARN -> (string)

                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services resources. We require an ARN  when
                                   you  need  to  specify a resource unambigu-
                                   ously across all of  Amazon  Web  Services.

                                      resource tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue

                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a  key-value  pair  in  a tag set of
                                          finances : April and also of payroll
                                          : April .

                                      volume.   For   example,  fsx/parentVol-
                                      ume/volume1 .

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to  reserve  from the parent volume. You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The  maximum amount of storage in gibib-

                                      its  parent.  You  can  specify  a quota
                                      larger than the storage  on  the  parent
                                      volume.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The  method used to compress the data on
                                      the volume. Unless a compression type is
                                      specified,  volumes inherit the DataCom-
                                      pressionType value of their parent  vol-
                                      ume.

                                      o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress the data on
                                        the volume.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume  using  the  Zstandard (ZSTD) com-
                                        pression  algorithm.  This   algorithm
                                        reduces  the  amount  of space used on
                                        your volume and has very little impact
                                        on compute resources.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object that  specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given  resource. ARNs uniquely iden-
                                          tify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                                          We  require  an ARN when you need to
                                          specify  a  resource   unambiguously
                                          across  all  of Amazon Web Services.

                                          The strategy used when copying  data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE - The new volume  references
                                            the  data  in the origin snapshot.
                                            Cloning a snapshot is faster  than
                                            copying  the  data from a snapshot
                                            to a new volume and  doesn't  con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin snapshot can't  be  deleted
                                            if  there  is  a  volume using its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY - Copies all  data  from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  value indicating whether the

                            The  number  of  days to retain automatic backups.
                            Setting this  property  to  0  disables  automatic
                            backups.  You  can  retain automatic backups for a
                            maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value indicating  whether  tags  on  the
                            file  system  should be copied to backups. If it's
                            set to true , all tags  on  the  file  system  are
                            copied  to all automatic backups and any user-ini-
                            tiated backups where the user doesn't specify  any
                            tags. If this value is true and you specify one or
                            more tags, only the specified tags are  copied  to
                            backups. If you specify one or more tags when cre-
                            ating a user-initiated backup, no tags are  copied
                            from the file system, regardless of this value.

                        CopyTagsToVolumes -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value  indicating whether tags for the
                            volume should be copied to snapshots.  This  value
                            defaults to false . If it's set to true , all tags
                            for the volume are copied to snapshots  where  the
                            user  doesn't  specify tags. If this value is true
                            and you specify one or more tags, only the  speci-
                            fied  tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify
                            one or more tags when creating  the  snapshot,  no
                            tags  are  copied  from  the volume, regardless of
                            this value.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM  .  HH
                            is  the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM
                            is the zero-padded minute of the hour.  For  exam-
                            ple, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                            Domain  Name  System (DNS) name or IP address. You
                            can create a JunctionPath directly below a  parent
                            volume junction or on a directory within a volume.
                            A JunctionPath for a volume named  vol3  might  be
                            /vol1/vol2/vol3  ,  or  /vol1/dir2/vol3  , or even
                            /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                            the  root  volume  for its storage virtual machine
                            (SVM). Only one volume on an SVM can be  the  root
                            volume.  This  value  defaults  to false . If this
                            value is true , then this is the SVM root  volume.

                            This  flag  is useful when you're deleting an SVM,
                            because you must first delete  all  non-root  vol-
                            umes.  This  flag,  when  set to false , helps you
                            identify which volumes to delete  before  you  can
                            delete the SVM.

                               Used with the AUTO  and  SNAPSHOT_ONLY  tiering
                               policies.  Enter  a  whole number between 2 and
                               183. Default values are 31 days for AUTO and  2
                               days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                            Name -> (string)
                               Specifies the tiering policy used to transition
                               data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                               o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots  to  the
                                 capacity pool storage tier.

                               o AUTO  - moves cold user data and snapshots to
                                 the capacity pool storage tier based on  your
                                 access patterns.

                               o ALL  - moves all user data blocks in both the
                                 active file system and Snapshot copies to the
                                 storage pool tier.

                               o NONE  -  keeps a volume's data in the primary
                                 storage tier, preventing it from being  moved
                                 to the capacity pool tier.

                        UUID -> (string)
                            The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

                        OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                            Specifies the type of volume. Valid values are the
                            following:

                            o RW  specifies  a  read/write  volume.  RW is the
                              default.

                            o DP specifies a data-protection volume.  You  can
                              protect  data  by replicating it to data-protec-
                              tion mirror copies. If a  disaster  occurs,  you
                              can  use  these data-protection mirror copies to
                              recover data.

                            o LS specifies a  load-sharing  mirror  volume.  A
                              load-sharing  mirror reduces the network traffic
                              to a  FlexVol  volume  by  providing  additional
                              read-only access to clients.

                     ResourceARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource.
                        ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                        We  require an ARN when you need to specify a resource
                        unambiguously across all of Amazon Web  Services.  For
                        more  information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
                        the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                     Tags -> (list)
                        A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

                        (structure)

                            AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                               Describes the type of administrative action, as
                               follows:

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  -  A  file  system update
                                 administrative action initiated from the Ama-
                                 zon  FSx console, API (UpdateFileSystem ), or
                                 CLI (update-file-system ).

                               o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION -  After  the  FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE  task  to increase a file system's
                                 storage capacity has been completed  success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using the ProgressPercent property. When  STOR-
                               AGE_OPTIMIZATION  has  been  completed success-

                                   Aliases -> (list)
                                      An array of one or more DNS aliases that
                                      are currently associated with the Amazon
                                      FSx  file  system.  Aliases allow you to
                                      use existing DNS  names  to  access  the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can associate up to 50  aliases  with  a
                                      file  system  at any time. You can asso-
                                      ciate additional DNS aliases  after  you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You  can
                                      remove  DNS aliases from the file system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need to specify the alias  name  in  the
                                      request  payload.  For more information,

                                          the  file  system. You can use a DNS
                                          alias to access a file system  using
                                          user-defined  DNS names, in addition
                                          to the default DNS name that  Amazon
                                          FSx  assigns to the file system. For

                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is designed for  temporary  storage  and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2 deployment
                                          types are best suited for  when  you
                                          need     temporary    storage    and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2  deployment  type provides
                                          in-transit encryption  of  data  and
                                          higher   burst  throughput  capacity

                                      on the file system are copied  to  back-
                                      ups.  If  it's  set to true, all tags on
                                      the file system are copied to all  auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups where the user  doesn't  specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is required  when  StorageType  is  HDD.
                                      When  set to READ the file system has an
                                      SSD storage cache that is sized  to  20%
                                      of  the  file system's storage capacity.
                                      This improves the performance  for  fre-
                                      quently  accessed files by caching up to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This parameter is  required  when  Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                      The  configured  size  of the volume, in
                                      megabytes (MBs).

                                   StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                                      The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                      The  ID  of the volume's storage virtual
                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                   TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                                      The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                                      CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                                          Specifies  the  number  of days that
                                          user data in a  volume  must  remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity
                                          pool.  Used  with the AUTO and SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY tiering policies. Enter  a
                                          whole  number  between  2  and  183.
                                          Default values are 31 days for  AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition data.  Default  value  is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO  -  moves  cold user data and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool
                                            storage  tier based on your access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing  it  from  being  moved to the
                                            capacity pool tier.

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The volume's universally unique  identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster occurs,  you  can  use  these
                                        data-protection   mirror   copies   to
                                        recover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume.  A load-sharing mirror reduces
                                        the network traffic to a FlexVol  vol-
                                        ume  by providing additional read-only
                                        access to clients.

                               ResourceARN -> (string)

                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services resources. We require an ARN  when
                                   you  need  to  specify a resource unambigu-
                                   ously across all of  Amazon  Web  Services.
                                   For  more  information, see Amazon Resource
                                   Names (ARNs) in  the  Amazon  Web  Services

                                      resource tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue
                                          ,  the  value assigned to the corre-
                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a  key-value  pair  in  a tag set of
                                          finances : April and also of payroll
                                          : April .

                                   The reason why the volume lifecycle  status
                                   changed.

                                   Message -> (string)
                                      A detailed error message.

                                      volume.   For   example,  fsx/parentVol-
                                      ume/volume1 .

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to  reserve  from the parent volume. You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The  maximum amount of storage in gibib-
                                      tyes (GiB) that the volume can use  from
                                      its  parent.  You  can  specify  a quota
                                      larger than the storage  on  the  parent
                                      volume.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The  method used to compress the data on
                                      the volume. Unless a compression type is
                                      specified,  volumes inherit the DataCom-
                                      pressionType value of their parent  vol-
                                      ume.

                                      o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress the data on
                                        the volume.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume  using  the  Zstandard (ZSTD) com-
                                        pression  algorithm.  This   algorithm
                                        reduces  the  amount  of space used on
                                        your volume and has very little impact
                                        on compute resources.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object that  specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given  resource. ARNs uniquely iden-
                                          tify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                                          We  require  an ARN when you need to

                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE - The new volume  references
                                            the  data  in the origin snapshot.
                                            Cloning a snapshot is faster  than
                                            copying  the  data from a snapshot
                                            to a new volume and  doesn't  con-

                                            if  there  is  a  volume using its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY - Copies all  data  from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                            specify a quota larger than  the  storage  on  the
                            parent volume.

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            The  method  used to compress the data on the vol-
                            ume. Unless a compression type is specified,  vol-
                            umes  inherit  the  DataCompressionType  value  of
                            their parent volume.

                            o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the  volume.

                            o ZSTD  -  Compresses the data in the volume using
                              the Zstandard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. This
                              algorithm  reduces  the  amount of space used on
                              your volume and has very little impact  on  com-
                              pute resources.

                        CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value  indicating whether tags for the
                            volume should be copied to snapshots.  This  value
                            defaults to false . If it's set to true , all tags
                            for the volume are copied to snapshots  where  the
                            user  doesn't  specify tags. If this value is true
                            and you specify one or more tags, only the  speci-
                            fied  tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify
                            one or more tags when creating  the  snapshot,  no
                            tags  are  copied  from  the volume, regardless of
                            this value.

                        OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                            The configuration object that specifies the  snap-
                            shot to use as the origin of the data for the vol-
                            ume.

                            SnapshotARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given
                               resource.  ARNs  uniquely  identify  Amazon Web
                               Services resources. We require an ARN when  you
                               need to specify a resource unambiguously across
                               all of Amazon Web Services. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
                               Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                            CopyStrategy -> (string)
                               The strategy used when copying  data  from  the
                               snapshot to the new volume.

                               o CLONE - The new volume references the data in
                                 the origin snapshot. Cloning  a  snapshot  is
                                 faster  than copying the data from a snapshot
                                 to a new  volume  and  doesn't  consume  disk
                                 throughput.   However,  the  origin  snapshot
                                 can't be deleted if there is a  volume  using
                                 its copied data.

                               o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot
                                 to the new volume.

                        ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value indicating whether the  volume  is
                            read-only.

                        NfsExports -> (list)

                            File System (NFS) file system.

                            (structure)
                               The Network File System NFS) configurations for
                               mounting an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                               ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                                   A list of configuration objects  that  con-
                                   tain  the  client  and options for mounting
                                   the OpenZFS file system.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies who can mount the file  system
                                      and  the  options that can be used while
                                      mounting the file system.

                                      Clients -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies who can mount
                                          the  file  system. You can provide a
                                          wildcard  character  (*  ),  an   IP
                                          address   (0.0.0.0   ),  or  a  CIDR
                                          address (192.0.2.0/24 . By  default,
                                          Amazon FSx uses the wildcard charac-
                                          ter when specifying the client.

                                      Options -> (list)
                                          The options to use when mounting the
                                          file  system.  For a list of options
                                          that you can use with  Network  File
                                          System  (NFS),  see the exports(5) -
                                          Linux man page . When choosing  your
                                          options, consider the following:

                                          o crossmount  is used by default. If
                                            you don't specify crossmount  when
                                            changing the client configuration,
                                            you won't be able to see or access
                                            snapshots  in  your  file system's
                                            snapshot directory.

                                          o sync is used by  default.  If  you
                                            instead specify async , the system
                                            acknowledges writes before writing
                                            to  disk.  If  the  system crashes
                                            before the  writes  are  finished,
                                            you lose the unwritten data.

                                          (string)

                        UserAndGroupQuotas -> (list)

                                   The amount of  storage  that  the  user  or
                                   group can use in gibibytes (GiB).

                 TargetSnapshotValues -> (structure)
                     A snapshot of an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume.

                     ResourceARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource.
                        ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                        We  require an ARN when you need to specify a resource
                        unambiguously across all of Amazon Web  Services.  For
                        more  information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
                        the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                     SnapshotId -> (string)

                     CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time that the resource  was  created,  in  seconds
                        (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

                     Lifecycle -> (string)
                        The lifecycle status of the snapshot.

                        o PENDING - Amazon FSx  hasn't  started  creating  the
                          snapshot.

                        o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the snapshot.

                        o DELETING - Amazon FSx is deleting the snapshot.

                            Key -> (string)
                               A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of
                               the tag.  Tag  keys  must  be  unique  for  the
                               resource to which they are attached.

                            Value -> (string)
                               A value that specifies the TagValue , the value
                               assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag val-
                               ues  can be null and don't have to be unique in
                               a  tag  set.  For  example,  you  can  have   a

                     AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                        A list of administrative actions for the  file  system
                        that are in process or waiting to be processed. Admin-
                        istrative actions describe changes to the  Amazon  FSx
                        system.

                        (structure)
                            Describes  a  specific  Amazon  FSx administrative
                            action for the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS
                            file system.

                            AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                               Describes the type of administrative action, as
                               follows:

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE -  A  file  system  update
                                 administrative action initiated from the Ama-
                                 zon FSx console, API (UpdateFileSystem ),  or
                                 CLI (update-file-system ).

                               o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE task to increase a  file  system's
                                 storage  capacity has been completed success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For Lustre, storage  optimization  consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-
                               AGE_OPTIMIZATION has  been  completed  success-
                               fully,  the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                               status changes to COMPLETED . For more informa-

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_ASSOCIATION - A file system
                                 update  to associate a new Domain Name System
                                 (DNS) alias with the file  system.  For  more

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION  -  A   file
                                 system  update  to  disassociate  a DNS alias
                                 from the file system. For  more  information,

                                      FSx file system. Aliases  allow  you  to
                                      use  existing  DNS  names  to access the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can  associate  up  to 50 aliases with a
                                      file system at any time. You  can  asso-
                                      ciate  additional  DNS aliases after you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can
                                      remove DNS aliases from the file  system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-

                                      need  to  specify  the alias name in the
                                      request payload. For  more  information,

                                      ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                                          For  files  imported  from  a   data
                                          repository,  this  value  determines
                                          the stripe count and maximum  amount
                                          of  data per file (in MiB) stored on
                                          a single physical disk. The  maximum
                                          number  of  disks that a single file
                                          can be striped across is limited  by
                                          the  total number of disks that make
                                          up the file system.

                                          The default chunk size is 1,024  MiB
                                          (1  GiB)  and  can  go  as  high  as
                                          512,000 MiB  (500  GiB).  Amazon  S3
                                          objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                                   DeploymentType -> (string)
                                      The  deployment type of the FSx for Lus-
                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is  designed  for  temporary storage and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                          types  are  best suited for when you
                                          need    temporary    storage     and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                          higher  burst  throughput   capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      The    PERSISTENT_1   and   PERSISTENT_2
                                      deployment type is used for  longer-term
                                      storage  and workloads and encryption of
                                      data in transit. PERSISTENT_2  is  built
                                      on   Lustre   v2.12  and  offers  higher
                                      PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up  to   1000
                                      MB/s/TiB)  along  with  a  lower minimum
                                      storage capacity requirement (600  GiB).

                                      write throughput per 1 tebibyte of stor-
                                      age provisioned. File system  throughput
                                      capacity  is  equal  to Storage capacity
                                      (TiB)     *     PerUnitStorageThroughput
                                      (MB/s/TiB).  This  option  is only valid
                                      for   PERSISTENT_1   and    PERSISTENT_2
                                      deployment types.

                                      Valid values:

                                   MountName -> (string)
                                      You use the MountName value when  mount-
                                      ing the file system.

                                      For  the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this
                                      value is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2  ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this value is a string  that
                                      is  unique within an Amazon Web Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A recurring daily time,  in  the  format
                                      HH:MM  .  HH  is the zero-padded hour of
                                      the  day   (0-23),   and   MM   is   the
                                      zero-padded  minute  of  the  hour.  For
                                      example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The number of days to  retain  automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 0 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      on  the  file system are copied to back-
                                      ups. If it's set to true,  all  tags  on
                                      the  file system are copied to all auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups  where  the user doesn't specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The type of drive cache used by  PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD.
                                      When set to READ the file system has  an
                                      SSD  storage  cache that is sized to 20%
                                      of the file system's  storage  capacity.
                                      This  improves  the performance for fre-
                                      quently accessed files by caching up  to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This  parameter  is  required when Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The data compression  configuration  for
                                      the file system. DataCompressionType can
                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE - Data compression is turned  off

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  flag indicating whether this
                                      volume is the root volume for its  stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume on an SVM can be  the  root  volume.
                                      This  value  defaults to false . If this
                                      value is true , then  this  is  the  SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an SVM, because you  must  first  delete
                                      all  non-root  volumes.  This flag, when
                                      set to false , helps you identify  which
                                      volumes  to delete before you can delete
                                      the SVM.

                                          "cold"  and  moved  to  the capacity
                                          pool. Used with the AUTO  and  SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY  tiering policies. Enter a
                                          whole  number  between  2  and  183.

                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster  occurs,  you  can  use these
                                        data-protection   mirror   copies   to
                                        recover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume. A load-sharing mirror  reduces
                                        the  network traffic to a FlexVol vol-
                                        ume by providing additional  read-only
                                        access to clients.

                               ResourceARN -> (string)

                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services  resources. We require an ARN when
                                   you need to specify  a  resource  unambigu-
                                   ously  across  all  of Amazon Web Services.
                                   For more information, see  Amazon  Resource
                                   Names  (ARNs)  in  the  Amazon Web Services

                                      resource tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the TagKey  ,
                                          the  name  of the tag. Tag keys must
                                          be unique for the resource to  which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagValue
                                          , the value assigned to  the  corre-
                                          sponding  tag key. Tag values can be
                                          null and don't have to be unique  in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a key-value pair in  a  tag  set  of
                                          finances : April and also of payroll
                                          : April .

                                   The  reason why the volume lifecycle status
                                   changed.

                                   Message -> (string)
                                      A detailed error message.

                                   The configuration  of  an  Amazon  FSx  for
                                   OpenZFS volume.

                                   ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                                      The ID of the parent volume.

                                   VolumePath -> (string)
                                      The  path  to  the  volume from the root
                                      volume.  For   example,   fsx/parentVol-
                                      ume/volume1 .

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to reserve from the parent  volume.  You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The maximum amount of storage in  gibib-
                                      tyes  (GiB) that the volume can use from
                                      its parent.  You  can  specify  a  quota
                                      larger  than  the  storage on the parent
                                      volume.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The method used to compress the data  on
                                      the volume. Unless a compression type is
                                      specified, volumes inherit the  DataCom-
                                      pressionType  value of their parent vol-
                                      ume.

                                      o NONE - Doesn't compress  the  data  on
                                        the volume.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  Zstandard  (ZSTD)  com-
                                        pression   algorithm.  This  algorithm
                                        reduces the amount of  space  used  on
                                        your volume and has very little impact
                                        on compute resources.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are copied to  snapshots  where  the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is true and  you  specify  one  or  more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are copied from the  volume,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration object that specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given resource. ARNs uniquely  iden-
                                          tify  Amazon Web Services resources.
                                          We require an ARN when you  need  to
                                          specify   a  resource  unambiguously
                                          across all of Amazon  Web  Services.
                                          For  more  information,  see  Amazon

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The  strategy used when copying data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE  - The new volume references
                                            the data in the  origin  snapshot.
                                            Cloning  a snapshot is faster than
                                            copying the data from  a  snapshot
                                            to  a  new volume and doesn't con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin  snapshot  can't be deleted
                                            if there is  a  volume  using  its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY  -  Copies all data from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating  whether  the
                                      volume is read-only.

                                   NfsExports -> (list)
