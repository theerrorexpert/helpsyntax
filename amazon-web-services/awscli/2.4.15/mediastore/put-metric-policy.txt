PUT-METRIC-POLICY()                                        PUT-METRIC-POLICY()



NAME
       put-metric-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       The  metric policy that you want to add to the container. A metric pol-
       icy allows AWS Elemental MediaStore to send metrics  to  Amazon  Cloud-
       Watch. It takes up to 20 minutes for the new policy to take effect.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-metric-policy
          --container-name <value>
          --metric-policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container that you want to add the metric policy to.

       --metric-policy (structure)
          The metric policy that you want to associate with the container.  In
          the  policy,  you  must indicate whether you want MediaStore to send
          container-level metrics. You can also include up to  five  rules  to
          define   groups   of  objects  that  you  want  MediaStore  to  send
          object-level metrics for. If you include rules in the  policy,  con-
          struct each rule with both of the following:

          o An  object  group  that  defines  which  objects to include in the
            group. The definition can be a path or a file name, but  it  can't
            have  more  than  900  characters. Valid characters are: a-z, A-Z,
            0-9, _ (underscore), = (equal), : (colon), . (period), - (hyphen),
            ~  (tilde), / (forward slash), and * (asterisk). Wildcards (*) are
            acceptable.

          o An object group name that allows you to refer to the object group.
            The name can't have more than 30 characters. Valid characters are:
            a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _ (underscore).

          ContainerLevelMetrics -> (string)
              A setting to enable or disable metrics at the container level.

          MetricPolicyRules -> (list)
              A parameter that holds an array of rules that enable metrics  at
              the  object level. This parameter is optional, but if you choose
              to include it, you must also  include  at  least  one  rule.  By
              default,  you can include up to five rules. You can also request
              a quota increase to allow up to 300 rules per policy.

              (structure)
                 A setting that enables metrics at the object level. Each rule
                 contains  an  object  group  and an object group name. If the
                 policy includes the  MetricPolicyRules  parameter,  you  must
                 include  at least one rule. Each metric policy can include up
                 to five rules by  default.  You  can  also  request  a  quota
                 increase to allow up to 300 rules per policy.

                 ObjectGroup -> (string)
                     A path or file name that defines which objects to include
                     in the group. Wildcards (*) are acceptable.

                 ObjectGroupName -> (string)
                     A name that allows you to refer to the object group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ContainerLevelMetrics=string,MetricPolicyRules=[{ObjectGroup=string,ObjectGroupName=string},{ObjectGroup=string,ObjectGroupName=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ContainerLevelMetrics": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED",
            "MetricPolicyRules": [
              {
                "ObjectGroup": "string",
                "ObjectGroupName": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
