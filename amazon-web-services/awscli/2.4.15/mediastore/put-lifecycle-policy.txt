PUT-LIFECYCLE-POLICY()                                  PUT-LIFECYCLE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-lifecycle-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Writes  an  object  lifecycle  policy  to a container. If the container
       already has an object lifecycle policy, the service replaces the exist-
       ing  policy  with  the  new  policy.  It takes up to 20 minutes for the
       change to take effect.

       For information about how to construct an object lifecycle policy,  see
       Components of an Object Lifecycle Policy .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-lifecycle-policy
          --container-name <value>
          --lifecycle-policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container that you want to assign the object lifecy-
          cle policy to.

       --lifecycle-policy (string)
          The object lifecycle policy to apply to the container.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an object lifecycle policy

       The following put-lifecycle-policy example attaches an object lifecycle
       policy to the specified container. This enables you to specify how long
       the service should store objects in your container. MediaStore  deletes
       objects  in  the  container  once  they reach their expiration date, as
       indicated in the policy, which is in the file  named  LiveEventsLifecy-
       clePolicy.json.

          aws mediastore put-lifecycle-policy \
              --container-name ExampleContainer \
              --lifecycle-policy file://ExampleLifecyclePolicy.json

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information, see Adding an Object Lifecycle Policy to a Con-
       tainer in the AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
