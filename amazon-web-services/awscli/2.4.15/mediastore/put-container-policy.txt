PUT-CONTAINER-POLICY()                                  PUT-CONTAINER-POLICY()



NAME
       put-container-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  access  policy for the specified container to restrict the
       users and clients that can access it. For information  about  the  data
       that  is  included in an access policy, see the AWS Identity and Access
       Management User Guide .

       For this release of the REST API, you can create only one policy for  a
       container.  If  you  enter PutContainerPolicy twice, the second command
       modifies the existing policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-container-policy
          --container-name <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container.

       --policy (string)
          The contents of the policy, which includes the following:

          o One Version tag

          o One Statement tag that contains the standard tags for the  policy.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To edit a container policy

       The  following  put-container-policy example assigns a different policy
       to the specified container. In this  example,  the  updated  policy  is
       defined in a file named LiveEventsContainerPolicy.json.

          aws mediastore put-container-policy \
              --container-name LiveEvents \
              --policy file://LiveEventsContainerPolicy.json

       This command produces no output.

       tal MediaStore User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
