GET-CORS-POLICY()                                            GET-CORS-POLICY()



NAME
       get-cors-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration informa-
       tion that is set for the container.

       To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the  MediaS-
       tore:GetCorsPolicy  action.  By  default,  the container owner has this
       permission and can grant it to others.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-cors-policy
          --container-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container that the policy is assigned to.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a CORS policy

       The  following  get-cors-policy  example  displays   the   cross-origin
       resource  sharing  (CORS) policy that is assigned to the specified con-
       tainer.

          aws mediastore get-cors-policy \
              --container-name ExampleContainer \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "CorsPolicy": [
                  {
                      "AllowedMethods": [
                          "GET",
                          "HEAD"
                      ],
                      "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000,
                      "AllowedOrigins": [
                          ""
                      ],
                      "AllowedHeaders": [
                          ""
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       CorsPolicy -> (list)
          The CORS policy assigned to the container.

          (structure)
              A  rule for a CORS policy. You can add up to 100 rules to a CORS
              policy. If more than one rule  applies,  the  service  uses  the
              first applicable rule listed.

              AllowedOrigins -> (list)
                 One  or  more response headers that you want users to be able
                 to access  from  their  applications  (for  example,  from  a
                 JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object).

                 Each CORS rule must have at least one AllowedOrigins element.
                 The string value can include only one wildcard character (*),
                 for example, http://
                 *
                 .example.com. Additionally, you can specify only one wildcard
                 character to allow cross-origin access for all origins.

                 (string)

              AllowedMethods -> (list)
                 Identifies an HTTP method that the origin that  is  specified
                 in the rule is allowed to execute.

                 Each  CORS  rule must contain at least one AllowedMethods and
                 one AllowedOrigins element.

                 (string)

              AllowedHeaders -> (list)
                 Specifies which headers are allowed in  a  preflight  OPTIONS
                 request  through  the  Access-Control-Request-Headers header.
                 Each  header  name   that   is   specified   in   Access-Con-
                 trol-Request-Headers  must  have a corresponding entry in the
                 rule. Only the headers that were requested are sent back.

                 This element can contain only one wildcard character (*).

                 (string)

              MaxAgeSeconds -> (integer)
                 The time in seconds that your browser  caches  the  preflight
                 response for the specified resource.

                 A CORS rule can have only one MaxAgeSeconds element.

              ExposeHeaders -> (list)
                 One or more headers in the response that you want users to be
                 able to access from their applications (for example,  from  a
                 JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object).

                 This element is optional for each rule.

                 (string)
