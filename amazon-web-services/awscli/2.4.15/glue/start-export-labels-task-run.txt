START-EXPORT-LABELS-TASK-RUN()                  START-EXPORT-LABELS-TASK-RUN()



NAME
       start-export-labels-task-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Begins an asynchronous task to export all labeled data for a particular
       transform. This task is the only label-related API  call  that  is  not
       part  of the typical active learning workflow. You typically use Start-
       ExportLabelsTaskRun when you want to work with  all  of  your  existing
       labels  at  the  same  time,  such as when you want to remove or change
       labels that were previously submitted  as  truth.  This  API  operation
       accepts  the  TransformId whose labels you want to export and an Amazon
       Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path to export the  labels  to.  The
       operation  returns  a  TaskRunId  . You can check on the status of your
       task run by calling the GetMLTaskRun API.

SYNOPSIS
            start-export-labels-task-run
          --transform-id <value>
          --output-s3-path <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transform-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.

       --output-s3-path (string)
          The Amazon S3 path where you export the labels.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TaskRunId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the task run.
