BATCH-GET-DEV-ENDPOINTS()                            BATCH-GET-DEV-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       batch-get-dev-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  resource metadata for a given list of development
       endpoint names. After calling the ListDevEndpoints operation,  you  can
       call  this  operation to access the data to which you have been granted
       permissions. This operation supports  all  IAM  permissions,  including
       permission conditions that uses tags.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-dev-endpoints
          --dev-endpoint-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dev-endpoint-names (list)
          The  list  of  DevEndpoint  names, which might be the names returned
          from the ListDevEndpoint operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DevEndpoints -> (list)
          A list of DevEndpoint definitions.

          (structure)
              A development endpoint where  a  developer  can  remotely  debug
              extract, transform, and load (ETL) scripts.

              EndpointName -> (string)
                 The name of the DevEndpoint .

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used in this
                 DevEndpoint .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 A list of security group identifiers used in this DevEndpoint
                 .

                 (string)

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The subnet ID for this DevEndpoint .

              YarnEndpointAddress -> (string)
                 The YARN endpoint address used by this DevEndpoint .

              PrivateAddress -> (string)
                 A  private  IP address to access the DevEndpoint within a VPC
                 if the DevEndpoint is created within one. The  PrivateAddress
                 field  is present only when you create the DevEndpoint within
                 your VPC.

              ZeppelinRemoteSparkInterpreterPort -> (integer)
                 The Apache Zeppelin port for the remote Apache  Spark  inter-
                 preter.

              PublicAddress -> (string)
                 The  public  IP address used by this DevEndpoint . The Publi-
                 cAddress field is present only when you create a  non-virtual
                 private cloud (VPC) DevEndpoint .

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of this DevEndpoint .

              WorkerType -> (string)
                 The type of predefined worker that is allocated to the devel-
                 opment endpoint. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or  G.2X.

                 o For  the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU,
                   16 GB of memory and  a  50GB  disk,  and  2  executors  per
                   worker.

                 o For  the  G.1X  worker  type,  each worker maps to 1 DPU (4
                   vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor
                   per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-inten-
                   sive jobs.

                 o For the G.2X worker type, each worker  maps  to  2  DPU  (8
                   vCPU,  32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1 execu-
                   tor per worker. We recommend  this  worker  type  for  mem-
                   ory-intensive jobs.

                 Known  issue: when a development endpoint is created with the
                 G.2X  WorkerType configuration, the  Spark  drivers  for  the
                 development endpoint will run on 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and
                 a 64 GB disk.

              GlueVersion -> (string)
                 Glue version determines the  versions  of  Apache  Spark  and
                 Python  that  Glue supports. The Python version indicates the
                 version supported for running your ETL scripts on development
                 endpoints.

                 For  more  information  about the available Glue versions and
                 corresponding Spark and Python versions, see Glue version  in
                 the developer guide.

                 Development  endpoints  that are created without specifying a
                 Glue version default to Glue 0.9.

                 You can specify a version of Python support  for  development
                 endpoints  by  using the Arguments parameter in the CreateDe-
                 vEndpoint or UpdateDevEndpoint APIs. If no arguments are pro-
                 vided, the version defaults to Python 2.

              NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
                 The  number of workers of a defined workerType that are allo-
                 cated to the development endpoint.

                 The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for G.1X
                 , and 149 for G.2X .

              NumberOfNodes -> (integer)
                 The  number of Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) allocated to
                 this DevEndpoint .

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The AWS Availability Zone where this DevEndpoint is  located.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  virtual  private  cloud  (VPC) used by this
                 DevEndpoint .

              ExtraPythonLibsS3Path -> (string)
                 The paths to one or more Python libraries  in  an  Amazon  S3
                 bucket  that  should be loaded in your DevEndpoint . Multiple
                 values must be complete paths separated by a comma.

                 NOTE:
                     You can only use pure Python libraries with a DevEndpoint
                     . Libraries that rely on C extensions, such as the pandas
                     Python data analysis  library,  are  not  currently  sup-
                     ported.

              ExtraJarsS3Path -> (string)
                 The  path to one or more Java .jar files in an S3 bucket that
                 should be loaded in your DevEndpoint .

                 NOTE:
                     You can only use pure Java/Scala libraries with a DevEnd-
                     point .

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 The reason for a current failure in this DevEndpoint .

              LastUpdateStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the last update.

              CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The point in time at which this DevEndpoint was created.

              LastModifiedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  point  in  time at which this DevEndpoint was last modi-
                 fied.

              PublicKey -> (string)
                 The public key to be used by this DevEndpoint for authentica-
                 tion.  This  attribute is provided for backward compatibility
                 because the recommended attribute to use is public keys.

              PublicKeys -> (list)
                 A list of public keys to be  used  by  the  DevEndpoints  for
                 authentication. Using this attribute is preferred over a sin-
                 gle public key because the public keys allow you  to  have  a
                 different private key per client.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you previously created an endpoint with a public key,
                     you must remove that key to be able to set a list of pub-
                     lic  keys.  Call the UpdateDevEndpoint API operation with
                     the public key content in the deletePublicKeys attribute,
                     and  the list of new keys in the addPublicKeys attribute.

                 (string)

              SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
                 The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure  to  be  used
                 with this DevEndpoint .

              Arguments -> (map)
                 A map of arguments used to configure the DevEndpoint .

                 Valid arguments are:

                 o "--enable-glue-datacatalog": ""

                 You  can  specify a version of Python support for development
                 endpoints by using the Arguments parameter in  the  CreateDe-
                 vEndpoint or UpdateDevEndpoint APIs. If no arguments are pro-
                 vided, the version defaults to Python 2.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       DevEndpointsNotFound -> (list)
          A list of DevEndpoints not found.

          (string)
