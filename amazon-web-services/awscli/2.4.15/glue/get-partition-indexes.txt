GET-PARTITION-INDEXES()                                GET-PARTITION-INDEXES()



NAME
       get-partition-indexes -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the partition indexes associated with a table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-partition-indexes  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PartitionIndexDescriptorList

SYNOPSIS
            get-partition-indexes
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --database-name <value>
          --table-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The catalog ID where the table resides.

       --database-name (string)
          Specifies the name of a database from which  you  want  to  retrieve
          partition indexes.

       --table-name (string)
          Specifies  the  name  of  a table for which you want to retrieve the
          partition indexes.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PartitionIndexDescriptorList -> (list)
          A list of index descriptors.

          (structure)
              A descriptor for a partition index in a table.

              IndexName -> (string)
                 The name of the partition index.

              Keys -> (list)
                 A list of one or more keys, as  KeySchemaElement  structures,
                 for the partition index.

                 (structure)
                     A partition key pair consisting of a name and a type.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of a partition key.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of a partition key.

              IndexStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the partition index.

                 The possible statuses are:

                 o CREATING: The index is being created. When an index is in a
                   CREATING state, the index or its table cannot be deleted.

                 o ACTIVE: The index creation succeeds.

                 o FAILED: The index creation fails.

                 o DELETING: The index is deleted from the list of indexes.

              BackfillErrors -> (list)
                 A list of errors that can occur  when  registering  partition
                 indexes for an existing table.

                 (structure)
                     A  list  of errors that can occur when registering parti-
                     tion indexes for an existing table.

                     These errors give the details about why an  index  regis-
                     tration failed and provide a limited number of partitions
                     in the response, so that you can fix  the  partitions  at
                     fault  and try registering the index again. The most com-
                     mon set of errors that can occur are categorized as  fol-
                     lows:

                     o EncryptedPartitionError:  The partitions are encrypted.

                     o InvalidPartitionTypeDataError:  The   partition   value
                       doesn't  match the data type for that partition column.

                     o MissingPartitionValueError:    The    partitions    are
                       encrypted.

                     o UnsupportedPartitionCharacterError:  Characters  inside
                       the partition value are  not  supported.  For  example:
                       U+0000 , U+0001, U+0002.

                     o InternalError: Any error which does not belong to other
                       error codes.

                     Code -> (string)
                        The error code for an error that occurred when  regis-
                        tering partition indexes for an existing table.

                     Partitions -> (list)
                        A  list  of  a  limited  number  of  partitions in the
                        response.

                        (structure)
                            Contains a list of values defining partitions.

                            Values -> (list)
                               The list of values.

                               (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, present if the current list segment is not the
          last.
