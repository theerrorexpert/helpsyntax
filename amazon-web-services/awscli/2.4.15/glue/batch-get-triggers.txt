BATCH-GET-TRIGGERS()                                      BATCH-GET-TRIGGERS()



NAME
       batch-get-triggers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of resource metadata for a given list of trigger names.
       After calling the ListTriggers operation, you can call  this  operation
       to  access  the  data  to which you have been granted permissions. This
       operation supports all IAM permissions, including permission conditions
       that uses tags.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-triggers
          --trigger-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trigger-names (list)
          A  list  of  trigger names, which may be the names returned from the
          ListTriggers operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Schedule -> (string)
                 A  cron  expression  used  to  specify  the   schedule   (see
                 Time-Based  Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers . For example, to
                 run something every day at  12:15  UTC,  you  would  specify:
                 cron(15 12 * * ? *) .

              Actions -> (list)
                 The actions initiated by this trigger.

                 (structure)
                     Defines an action to be initiated by a trigger.

                     JobName -> (string)
                        The name of a job to be run.

                     Arguments -> (map)
                        The  job  arguments  used when this trigger fires. For
                        this job run, they replace the default  arguments  set
                        in the job definition itself.

                        You  can specify arguments here that your own job-exe-
                        cution script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue
                        itself consumes.

                        For  information about how to specify and consume your
                        own Job arguments, see the Calling Glue APIs in Python
                        topic in the developer guide.

                        For  information  about  the key-value pairs that Glue
                        consumes to set up your job, see the  Special  Parame-
                        ters Used by Glue topic in the developer guide.

                        terminated  and  enters TIMEOUT status. The default is
                        2,880 minutes (48 hours). This overrides  the  timeout
