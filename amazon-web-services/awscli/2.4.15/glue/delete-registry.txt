DELETE-REGISTRY()                                            DELETE-REGISTRY()



NAME
       delete-registry -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete the entire registry including schema and all of its versions. To
       get the status of the delete operation, you can  call  the  GetRegistry
       API  after  the  asynchronous call. Deleting a registry will deactivate
       all online operations for the registry such  as  the  UpdateRegistry  ,
       CreateSchema , UpdateSchema , and RegisterSchemaVersion APIs.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-registry
          --registry-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (structure)
          This  is  a wrapper structure that may contain the registry name and
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          RegistryName -> (string)
              Name of the registry. Used only for lookup. One  of  RegistryArn
              or RegistryName has to be provided.

          RegistryArn -> (string)
              Arn  of  the  registry to be updated. One of RegistryArn or Reg-
              istryName has to be provided.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegistryName=string,RegistryArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegistryName": "string",
            "RegistryArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RegistryName -> (string)
          The name of the registry being deleted.

       RegistryArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the registry being deleted.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the registry. A successful operation will  return  the
          Deleting status.
