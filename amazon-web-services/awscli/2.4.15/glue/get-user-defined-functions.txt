GET-USER-DEFINED-FUNCTIONS()                      GET-USER-DEFINED-FUNCTIONS()



NAME
       get-user-defined-functions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves multiple function definitions from the Data Catalog.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-user-defined-functions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: UserDefinedFunctions

SYNOPSIS
            get-user-defined-functions
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          [--database-name <value>]
          --pattern <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The ID of the Data Catalog where the functions to be  retrieved  are
          located.  If none is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is
          used by default.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the catalog database where the functions are located. If
          none  is provided, functions from all the databases across the cata-
          log will be returned.

       --pattern (string)
          An optional function-name pattern string that filters  the  function
          definitions returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UserDefinedFunctions -> (list)
          A list of requested function definitions.

          (structure)
              Represents the equivalent of a Hive user-defined function (UDF )
              definition.

              FunctionName -> (string)
                 The name of the function.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 The  name of the catalog database that contains the function.

              ClassName -> (string)
                 The Java class that contains the function code.

              OwnerName -> (string)
                 The owner of the function.

              OwnerType -> (string)
                 The owner type.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the function was created.

              ResourceUris -> (list)
                 The resource URIs for the function.

                 (structure)
                     The URIs for function resources.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The type of the resource.

                     Uri -> (string)
                        The URI for accessing the resource.

              CatalogId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Data Catalog in which the function resides.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, if the list of  functions  returned  does  not
          include the last requested function.
