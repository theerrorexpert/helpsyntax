DELETE-SCHEMA()                                                DELETE-SCHEMA()



NAME
       delete-schema -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the entire schema set, including the schema set and all of its
       versions. To get the status of  the  delete  operation,  you  can  call
       GetSchema  API  after  the  asynchronous call. Deleting a registry will
       deactivate  all  online  operations  for  the  schema,  such   as   the
       GetSchemaByDefinition , and RegisterSchemaVersion APIs.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-schema
          --schema-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --schema-id (structure)
          This  is  a  wrapper  structure that may contain the schema name and
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema. One  of  SchemaArn
              or SchemaName has to be provided.

          SchemaName -> (string)
              The name of the schema. One of SchemaArn or SchemaName has to be
              provided.

          RegistryName -> (string)
              The name of the schema registry that contains the schema.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,SchemaName=string,RegistryName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "SchemaName": "string",
            "RegistryName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SchemaArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema being deleted.

       SchemaName -> (string)
          The name of the schema being deleted.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the schema.
