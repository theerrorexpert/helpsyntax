NAME
       get-crawlers -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata for all crawlers defined in the customer account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-crawlers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Crawlers

SYNOPSIS
            get-crawlers
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            Indicates whether to scan all the records,  or  to
                            sample  rows  from  the  table.  Scanning  all the
                            records can take a long time when the table is not
                            a high throughput table.

                            A value of true means to scan all records, while a
                            value of false means to sample the records. If  no
                            value is specified, the value defaults to true .

                            records can take a long time when the table is not
                            a high throughput table.

                            A value of true means to scan all records, while a
                            value  of false means to sample the records. If no
                            value is specified, the value defaults to true .

                        scanRate -> (double)
                            The percentage of  the  configured  read  capacity
                            units  to  use  by the Glue crawler. Read capacity
                            units is a term defined  by  DynamoDB,  and  is  a
                            numeric  value  that  acts as rate limiter for the
                            number of reads that can be performed on that  ta-
                            ble per second.

                            The  valid  values are null or a value between 0.1
                            to 1.5. A null value is used when  user  does  not
                            provide  a  value, and defaults to 0.5 of the con-
                            figured  Read  Capacity  Unit   (for   provisioned
                            tables), or 0.25 of the max configured Read Capac-

              DatabaseName -> (string)

                     crawl only folders that were added since the last crawler
                     run.

                     A value of CRAWL_EVERYTHING specifies crawling the entire
                     dataset again.

                     A value of CRAWL_NEW_FOLDERS_ONLY specifies crawling only
