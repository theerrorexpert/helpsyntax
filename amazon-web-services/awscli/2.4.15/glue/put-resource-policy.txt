NAME
       put-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the Data Catalog resource policy for access control.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-resource-policy
          --policy-in-json <value>
          [--resource-arn <value>]
          [--policy-hash-condition <value>]
          [--policy-exists-condition <value>]
          [--enable-hybrid <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-in-json (string)
          Contains the policy document to set, in JSON format.

       --resource-arn (string)
          Do not use. For internal use only.

       --policy-hash-condition (string)
          The  hash  value  returned  when  the  previous policy was set using
          PutResourcePolicy . Its purpose is to prevent  concurrent  modifica-
          tions  of  a policy. Do not use this parameter if no previous policy
          has been set.

       --policy-exists-condition (string)
          A value of MUST_EXIST is  used  to  update  a  policy.  A  value  of
          NOT_EXIST  is  used  to create a new policy. If a value of NONE or a
          null value is used, the call does not depend on the existence  of  a
          policy.

          Possible values:

          o MUST_EXIST

          o NOT_EXIST

          o NONE

       --enable-hybrid (string)
          If  'TRUE'  ,  indicates  that  you  are using both methods to grant
          cross-account access to Data Catalog resources:

          o By directly updating the resource policy with PutResourePolicy

          o By using the Grant permissions command on the Amazon Web  Services
            Management Console.

          Must  be  set to 'TRUE' if you have already used the Management Con-
          sole to  grant  cross-account  access,  otherwise  the  call  fails.
          Default is 'FALSE'.

          Possible values:

          o TRUE

          o FALSE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PolicyHash -> (string)
          A  hash  of the policy that has just been set. This must be included
          in a subsequent call that overwrites or updates this policy.
