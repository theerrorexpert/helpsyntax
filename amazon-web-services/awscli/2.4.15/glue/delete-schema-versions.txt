DELETE-SCHEMA-VERSIONS()                              DELETE-SCHEMA-VERSIONS()



NAME
       delete-schema-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Remove  versions  from  the specified schema. A version number or range
       may be supplied. If the compatibility mode forbids deleting of  a  ver-
       sion  that  is necessary, such as BACKWARDS_FULL, an error is returned.
       Calling the GetSchemaVersions API after this call will list the  status
       of the deleted versions.

       When  the  range  of version numbers contain check pointed version, the
       API will return a 409 conflict and will not proceed with the  deletion.
       You  have  to  remove the checkpoint first using the DeleteSchemaCheck-
       point API before using this API.

       You cannot use the DeleteSchemaVersions API to delete the first  schema
       version in the schema set. The first schema version can only be deleted
       by the DeleteSchema API. This operation will also delete  the  attached
       SchemaVersionMetadata  under  the schema versions. Hard deletes will be
       enforced on the database.

       If the compatibility mode forbids deleting of a version that is  neces-
       sary, such as BACKWARDS_FULL, an error is returned.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-schema-versions
          --schema-id <value>
          --versions <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --schema-id (structure)
          This  is  a  wrapper  structure that may contain the schema name and
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema. One  of  SchemaArn
              or SchemaName has to be provided.

          SchemaName -> (string)
              The name of the schema. One of SchemaArn or SchemaName has to be
              provided.

          RegistryName -> (string)
              The name of the schema registry that contains the schema.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,SchemaName=string,RegistryName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "SchemaName": "string",
            "RegistryName": "string"
          }

       --versions (string)
          A version range may be supplied which may be of the format:

          o a single version number, 5

          o a range, 5-8 : deletes versions 5, 6, 7, 8

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SchemaVersionErrors -> (list)
          A list of SchemaVersionErrorItem objects, each containing  an  error
          and schema version.

          (structure)
              An  object that contains the error details for an operation on a
              schema version.

              VersionNumber -> (long)
                 The version number of the schema.

              ErrorDetails -> (structure)
                 The details of the error for the schema version.

                 ErrorCode -> (string)
                     The error code for an error.

                 ErrorMessage -> (string)
                     The error message for an error.
