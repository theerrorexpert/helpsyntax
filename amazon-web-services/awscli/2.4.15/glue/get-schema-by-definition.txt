GET-SCHEMA-BY-DEFINITION()                          GET-SCHEMA-BY-DEFINITION()



NAME
       get-schema-by-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  schema by the SchemaDefinition . The schema definition is
       sent to the Schema Registry, canonicalized, and hashed. If the hash  is
       matched  within the scope of the SchemaName or ARN (or the default reg-
       istry, if none is supplied), that schemas metadata is returned.  Other-
       wise,  a  404 or NotFound error is returned. Schema versions in Deleted
       statuses will not be included in the results.

SYNOPSIS
            get-schema-by-definition
          --schema-id <value>
          --schema-definition <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --schema-id (structure)
          This is a wrapper structure to contain schema identity  fields.  The
          structure contains:

          o SchemaId$SchemaArn:  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema.
            One of SchemaArn or SchemaName has to be provided.

          o SchemaId$SchemaName: The name of the schema. One of  SchemaArn  or
            SchemaName has to be provided.

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the schema. One of SchemaArn
              or SchemaName has to be provided.

          SchemaName -> (string)
              The name of the schema. One of SchemaArn or SchemaName has to be
              provided.

          RegistryName -> (string)
              The name of the schema registry that contains the schema.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,SchemaName=string,RegistryName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "SchemaName": "string",
            "RegistryName": "string"
          }

       --schema-definition (string)
          The  definition of the schema for which schema details are required.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SchemaVersionId -> (string)
          The schema ID of the schema version.

       SchemaArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema.

       DataFormat -> (string)
          The data format of the schema definition. Currently  only  AVRO  and
          JSON are supported.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the schema version.

       CreatedTime -> (string)
          The date and time the schema was created.
