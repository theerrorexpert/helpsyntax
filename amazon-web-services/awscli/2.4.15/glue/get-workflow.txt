NAME
       get-workflow -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves resource metadata for a workflow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-workflow
          --name <value>
          [--include-graph | --no-include-graph]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the workflow to retrieve.

       --include-graph | --no-include-graph (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  include  a graph when returning the workflow
          resource metadata.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                   AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)
                                      This  field is deprecated. Use MaxCapac-
                                      ity instead.

                                      The number of Glue data processing units
                                      (DPUs)  allocated to this JobRun. From 2
                                      to  100  DPUs  can  be  allocated;   the
                                      default  is 10. A DPU is a relative mea-
                                      sure of processing power  that  consists
                                      of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB
                                      of memory. For more information, see the
                                      Glue pricing page .

                                   ExecutionTime -> (integer)
                                      The amount of time (in seconds) that the
                                      job run consumed resources.

                                   Timeout -> (integer)
                                      The JobRun timeout in minutes.  This  is
                                      the maximum time that a job run can con-
                                      sume resources before it  is  terminated
                                      and  enters  TIMEOUT status. The default
                                      is 2,880 minutes (48 hours). This  over-
                                      rides  the timeout value set in the par-
                                      ent job.

                                   MaxCapacity -> (double)

                                      (DPUs)  that  can be allocated when this
                                      job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of
                                      processing  power  that  consists  of  4
                                      vCPUs of compute capacity and 16  GB  of
                                      memory.  For  more  information, see the
                                      Glue pricing page .

                                      Do not set Max Capacity if using Worker-
                                      Type and NumberOfWorkers .

                                      The value that can be allocated for Max-
                                      Capacity depends on whether you are run-
                                      ning  a  Python  shell  job or an Apache
                                      Spark ETL job:

                                      o When you specify a  Python  shell  job
                                        (JobCommand.Name  ="pythonshell"), you
                                        can allocate either 0.0625 or  1  DPU.
                                        The default is 0.0625 DPU.

                                      o When  you  specify an Apache Spark ETL
                                        job (JobCommand.Name ="glueetl"),  you
                                        can  allocate  from 2 to 100 DPUs. The
                                        default is 10 DPUs. This job type can-
                                        not  have a fractional DPU allocation.

                                   WorkerType -> (string)
                                      The type of predefined  worker  that  is
                                      allocated  when  a  job  runs. Accepts a
                                      value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

                                      o For the  Standard  worker  type,  each
                                        worker  provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of mem-
                                        ory and a 50GB disk, and  2  executors
                                        per worker.

                                      o For  the G.1X worker type, each worker
                                        provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a
                                        64GB  disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                      o For the G.2X worker type, each  worker
                                        provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory and a
                                        128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                      runs.

                                      The  maximum  number  of workers you can
                                      define are 299 for G.1X ,  and  149  for
                                      G.2X .

                                      KMS. This name can be /aws-glue/jobs/  ,
                                      in  which case the default encryption is
                                      NONE . If you add a role name and  Secu-

                                   (DPUs) allocated to this JobRun. From 2  to
                                   100  DPUs  can be allocated; the default is
                                   10. A DPU is a relative measure of process-
                                   ing  power that consists of 4 vCPUs of com-
                                   pute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more

                                   The JobRun timeout in minutes. This is  the
                                   maximum  time  that  a  job run can consume
                                   resources  before  it  is  terminated   and
                                   enters TIMEOUT status. The default is 2,880
                                   minutes  (48  hours).  This  overrides  the
                                   timeout value set in the parent job.

                               MaxCapacity -> (double)
                                   The  number  of  Glue data processing units

                                   runs.  A  DPU is a relative measure of pro-
                                   cessing power that consists of 4  vCPUs  of
                                   compute  capacity  and 16 GB of memory. For
                                   more information, see the Glue pricing page
                                   .

                                   and NumberOfWorkers .

                                   The value that can be allocated for  MaxCa-
                                   pacity depends on whether you are running a
                                   Python shell job or  an  Apache  Spark  ETL
                                   job:

                                   o When you specify a Python shell job (Job-
                                     Command.Name  ="pythonshell"),  you   can
                                     allocate  either  0.0625  or  1  DPU. The
                                     default is 0.0625 DPU.

                                   o When you specify an Apache Spark ETL  job
                                     (JobCommand.Name   ="glueetl"),  you  can
                                     allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The  default
                                     is  10  DPUs. This job type cannot have a
                                     fractional DPU allocation.

                                   Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

                                   o For the Standard worker type, each worker
                                     provides  4  vCPU,  16 GB of memory and a
                                     50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

                                   o For the G.1X  worker  type,  each  worker
                                     provides  4  vCPU,  16 GB of memory and a
                                     64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                   o For the G.2X  worker  type,  each  worker
                                     provides  8  vCPU,  32 GB of memory and a
                                     128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                   The  maximum  number  of  workers  you  can
                                   define are 299 for G.1X , and 149 for  G.2X
                                   .

                                   Amazon CloudWatch using KMS. This name  can
                                   be  /aws-glue/jobs/  ,  in  which  case the
                                   default encryption is NONE . If you  add  a
                                   role  name  and  SecurityConfiguration name
                                   (in other  words,  /aws-glue/jobs-yourRole-
                                   Name-yourSecurityConfigurationName/ ), then
                                   that  security  configuration  is  used  to
                                   encrypt the log group.
