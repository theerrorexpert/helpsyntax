START-ML-LABELING-SET-GENERATION-TASTART-ML-LABELING-SET-GENERATION-TASK-RUN()



NAME
       start-ml-labeling-set-generation-task-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the active learning workflow for your machine learning transform
       to improve the transform's quality by generating label sets and  adding
       labels.

       When  the  StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun finishes, Glue will have
       generated a "labeling set" or a set of questions for humans to  answer.

       In  the  case  of the FindMatches transform, these questions are of the
       form, What is the correct way to group these rows together into  groups
       composed entirely of matching records?

       After the labeling process is finished, you can upload your labels with
       a call to  StartImportLabelsTaskRun  .  After  StartImportLabelsTaskRun
       finishes,  all  future  runs of the machine learning transform will use
       the new and improved labels and perform  a  higher-quality  transforma-
       tion.

SYNOPSIS
            start-ml-labeling-set-generation-task-run
          --transform-id <value>
          --output-s3-path <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transform-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.

       --output-s3-path (string)
          The  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path where you gener-
          ate the labeling set.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TaskRunId -> (string)
          The unique run identifier that is associated with this task run.
