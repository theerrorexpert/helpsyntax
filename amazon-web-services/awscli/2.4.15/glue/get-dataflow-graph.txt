GET-DATAFLOW-GRAPH()                                      GET-DATAFLOW-GRAPH()



NAME
       get-dataflow-graph -

DESCRIPTION
       Transforms a Python script into a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-dataflow-graph
          [--python-script <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --python-script (string)
          The Python script to transform.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DagNodes -> (list)
          A list of the nodes in the resulting DAG.

          (structure)
              Represents a node in a directed acyclic graph (DAG)

              Id -> (string)
                 A node identifier that is unique within the node's graph.

              NodeType -> (string)
                 The type of node that this is.

              Args -> (list)
                 Properties of the node, in the form of name-value pairs.

                 (structure)
                     An argument or property of a node.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the argument or property.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the argument or property.

                     Param -> (boolean)
                        True if the value is used as a parameter.

              LineNumber -> (integer)
                 The line number of the node.

       DagEdges -> (list)
          A list of the edges in the resulting DAG.

          (structure)
              Represents a directional edge in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

              Source -> (string)
                 The ID of the node at which the edge starts.

              Target -> (string)
                 The ID of the node at which the edge ends.

              TargetParameter -> (string)
                 The target of the edge.
