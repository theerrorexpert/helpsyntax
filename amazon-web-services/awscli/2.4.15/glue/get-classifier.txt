NAME
       get-classifier -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve a classifier by name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-classifier
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Name of the classifier to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 For more information, see built-in patterns in Writing Custom
                 Classifiers .

              CustomPatterns -> (string)
                 Optional custom grok patterns defined by this classifier. For
                 more information, see custom patterns in Writing Custom Clas-
                 sifiers .

          XMLClassifier -> (structure)
              A classifier for XML content.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the classifier.

              Classification -> (string)
                 An identifier of the data format that the classifier matches.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that this classifier was registered.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The time that this classifier was last updated.

              Version -> (long)
                 The version of this classifier.

              RowTag -> (string)
                 The XML tag designating the element that contains each record
                 in an XML  document  being  parsed.  This  can't  identify  a
                 self-closing  element  (closed  by /> ). An empty row element
                 that contains only attributes can be parsed  as  long  as  it
                 ends  with  a  closing  tag  (for  example,  <row  item_a="A"
                 item_b="B"></row> is okay, but <row item_a="A" item_b="B"  />
                 is not).

          JsonClassifier -> (structure)
              A classifier for JSON content.

                 A  JsonPath  string defining the JSON data for the classifier

                 in Writing JsonPath Custom Classifiers .
