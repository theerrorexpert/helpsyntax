       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-workflow
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--default-run-properties <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--max-concurrent-runs <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name to be assigned to the workflow. It should be unique within
          your account.

       --description (string)
          A description of the workflow.

       --default-run-properties (map)
          A collection of properties to be used as part of each  execution  of
          the workflow.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --tags (map)
          The tags to be used with this workflow.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --max-concurrent-runs (integer)
          You  can  use this parameter to prevent unwanted multiple updates to
          data, to control costs, or in some cases, to prevent  exceeding  the
          maximum  number  of concurrent runs of any of the component jobs. If
          you leave this parameter blank, there is no limit to the  number  of
          concurrent workflow runs.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The  name of the workflow which was provided as part of the request.
