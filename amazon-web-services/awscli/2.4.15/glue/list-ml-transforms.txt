LIST-ML-TRANSFORMS()                                      LIST-ML-TRANSFORMS()



NAME
       list-ml-transforms -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a sortable, filterable list of existing Glue machine learning
       transforms in this Amazon Web Services account, or the  resources  with
       the  specified tag. This operation takes the optional Tags field, which
       you can use as a filter of the responses so that tagged  resources  can
       be  retrieved  as  a  group.  If  you choose to use tag filtering, only
       resources with the tags are retrieved.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--sort <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token, if this is a continuation request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of a list to return.

       --filter (structure)
          A TransformFilterCriteria used to filter the machine learning trans-
          forms.

          Name -> (string)
              A  unique  transform  name  that  is  used to filter the machine
              learning transforms.

          TransformType -> (string)
              The type of machine learning transform that is  used  to  filter
              the machine learning transforms.

          Status -> (string)
              Filters  the  list  of  machine  learning transforms by the last
              known status of the transforms (to indicate whether a  transform
              can be used or not). One of "NOT_READY", "READY", or "DELETING".

          GlueVersion -> (string)
              This value determines which version of Glue this machine  learn-
              ing  transform  is  compatible with. Glue 1.0 is recommended for
              most customers. If the value is not set, the Glue  compatibility
              defaults to Glue 0.9. For more information, see Glue Versions in
              the developer guide.

          CreatedBefore -> (timestamp)
              The time and date before which the transforms were created.

          CreatedAfter -> (timestamp)
              The time and date after which the transforms were created.

          LastModifiedBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filter on transforms last modified before this date.

          LastModifiedAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filter on transforms last modified after this date.

          Schema -> (list)
              Filters on datasets with  a  specific  schema.  The  Map<Column,
              Type>  object  is  an  array of key-value pairs representing the
              schema this transform accepts, where Column is  the  name  of  a
              column,  and  Type is the type of the data such as an integer or
              string. Has an upper bound of 100 columns.

              (structure)
                 A key-value pair representing a column  and  data  type  that
                 this  transform  can run against. The Schema parameter of the
                 MLTransform may contain up to 100 of these structures.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the column.

                 DataType -> (string)
                     The type of data in the column.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,TransformType=string,Status=string,GlueVersion=string,CreatedBefore=timestamp,CreatedAfter=timestamp,LastModifiedBefore=timestamp,LastModifiedAfter=timestamp,Schema=[{Name=string,DataType=string},{Name=string,DataType=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "TransformType": "FIND_MATCHES",

                "DataType": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --sort (structure)
          A TransformSortCriteria used to sort  the  machine  learning  trans-
          forms.

          Column -> (string)
              The  column  to be used in the sorting criteria that are associ-
              ated with the machine learning transform.

          SortDirection -> (string)
              The sort direction to be used in the sorting criteria  that  are
              associated with the machine learning transform.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Column=string,SortDirection=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Column": "NAME"|"TRANSFORM_TYPE"|"STATUS"|"CREATED"|"LAST_MODIFIED",
            "SortDirection": "DESCENDING"|"ASCENDING"
          }

       --tags (map)
          Specifies to return only these tagged resources.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TransformIds -> (list)
          The  identifiers  of  all  the  machine  learning  transforms in the
          account, or the machine learning transforms with the specified tags.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, if the returned list does not contain the last
          metric available.
