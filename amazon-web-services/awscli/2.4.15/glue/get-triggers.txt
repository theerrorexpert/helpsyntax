GET-TRIGGERS()                                                  GET-TRIGGERS()



NAME
       get-triggers -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets all the triggers associated with a job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-triggers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Triggers

SYNOPSIS
            get-triggers
          [--dependent-job-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dependent-job-name (string)
          The name of the job to retrieve triggers for. The trigger  that  can
          start  this  job  is  returned, and if there is no such trigger, all
          triggers are returned.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Schedule -> (string)
                 A   cron   expression  used  to  specify  the  schedule  (see
                 Time-Based Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers . For example,  to
                 run  something  every  day  at  12:15 UTC, you would specify:
                 cron(15 12 * * ? *) .

              Actions -> (list)
                 The actions initiated by this trigger.

                 (structure)
                     Defines an action to be initiated by a trigger.

                     JobName -> (string)

                     Arguments -> (map)
                        The job arguments used when this  trigger  fires.  For
                        this  job  run, they replace the default arguments set
                        in the job definition itself.

                        You can specify arguments here that your own  job-exe-
                        cution script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue
                        itself consumes.

                        For information about how to specify and consume  your
                        own Job arguments, see the Calling Glue APIs in Python
                        topic in the developer guide.

                        For information about the key-value  pairs  that  Glue
                        consumes  to  set up your job, see the Special Parame-
                        ters Used by Glue topic in the developer guide.

                        terminated and enters TIMEOUT status. The  default  is
                        2,880  minutes  (48 hours). This overrides the timeout

                            applies to, and on which this trigger waits.

                        State -> (string)

                            ,  STOPPED  ,  FAILED  ,  and  TIMEOUT  . The only
                            crawler states that a trigger can listen  for  are

                     Number of events that must be received from Amazon Event-
                     Bridge before EventBridge event trigger fires.

                 BatchWindow -> (integer)
                     Window of time in seconds after which  EventBridge  event
                     trigger   fires.   Window  starts  when  first  event  is
