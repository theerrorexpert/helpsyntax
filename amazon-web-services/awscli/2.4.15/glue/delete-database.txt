NAME
       delete-database -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes a specified database from a Data Catalog.

       NOTE:
          After  completing  this  operation, you no longer have access to the
          tables (and all table versions and partitions that might  belong  to
          the  tables) and the user-defined functions in the deleted database.
          Glue deletes these "orphaned" resources asynchronously in  a  timely
          manner, at the discretion of the service.

          To  ensure  the  immediate deletion of all related resources, before
          calling    DeleteDatabase    ,     use     DeleteTableVersion     or
          BatchDeleteTableVersion  , DeletePartition or BatchDeletePartition ,
          DeleteUserDefinedFunction , and DeleteTable or BatchDeleteTable , to
          delete any resources that belong to the database.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-database
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The ID of the Data Catalog in which the database resides. If none is
          provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.

       --name (string)
          The name of the database to delete.  For  Hive  compatibility,  this
          must be all lowercase.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
