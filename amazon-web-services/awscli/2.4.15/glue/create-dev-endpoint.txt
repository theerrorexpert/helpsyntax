OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The name to be assigned to the new DevEndpoint .

       --role-arn (string)
          The IAM role for the DevEndpoint .

       --security-group-ids (list)
          Security  group  IDs  for  the security groups to be used by the new
          DevEndpoint .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subnet-id (string)
          The subnet ID for the new DevEndpoint to use.

       --public-key (string)
          The public key to be used by this  DevEndpoint  for  authentication.
          This  attribute  is  provided for backward compatibility because the
          recommended attribute to use is public keys.

       --public-keys (list)
          A list of public keys to be used by the  development  endpoints  for
          authentication. The use of this attribute is preferred over a single
          public key because the public keys allow you  to  have  a  different
          private key per client.

          NOTE:
              If  you  previously  created  an endpoint with a public key, you
              must remove that key to be able to set a list  of  public  keys.
              Call  the  UpdateDevEndpoint  API with the public key content in
              the deletePublicKeys attribute, and the list of new keys in  the
              addPublicKeys attribute.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --number-of-nodes (integer)
          The  number of Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) to allocate to this
          DevEndpoint .

       --worker-type (string)
          The type of predefined worker that is allocated to  the  development
          endpoint. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

          o For  the  Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB
            of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

          o For the G.1X worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU, 16 GB
            of  memory,  64  GB  disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We
            recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.

          o For the G.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPU, 32 GB
            of  memory,  128  GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We
            recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.

          Known issue: when a development endpoint is created  with  the  G.2X
          WorkerType configuration, the Spark drivers for the development end-
          point will run on 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and a 64 GB disk.

          Possible values:

          o Standard

          o G.1X

          o G.2X

       --glue-version (string)
          Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and Python that
          Glue  supports.  The  Python version indicates the version supported
          for running your ETL scripts on development endpoints.

          For more information about the available Glue  versions  and  corre-
          sponding  Spark  and Python versions, see Glue version in the devel-
          oper guide.

          Development endpoints that are created  without  specifying  a  Glue
          version default to Glue 0.9.

          You  can  specify  a  version of Python support for development end-
          points by using the Arguments parameter in the CreateDevEndpoint  or
          UpdateDevEndpoint  APIs.  If  no arguments are provided, the version
          defaults to Python 2.

       --number-of-workers (integer)
          The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated  to
          the development endpoint.

          The  maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for G.1X , and
          149 for G.2X .

       --extra-python-libs-s3-path (string)
          The paths to one or more Python libraries in  an  Amazon  S3  bucket
          that  should be loaded in your DevEndpoint . Multiple values must be
          complete paths separated by a comma.

          NOTE:
              You can only use pure Python  libraries  with  a  DevEndpoint  .
              Libraries  that  rely on C extensions, such as the pandas Python
              data analysis library, are not yet supported.

       --extra-jars-s3-path (string)
          The path to one or more Java .jar files in an S3 bucket that  should
          be loaded in your DevEndpoint .

       --security-configuration (string)
          The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this
          DevEndpoint .

       --tags (map)
          The tags to use with this DevEndpoint. You may  use  tags  to  limit
          access  to the DevEndpoint. For more information about tags in Glue,
          see Amazon Web Services Tags in Glue in the developer guide.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --arguments (map)
          A map of arguments used to configure the DevEndpoint .

          key -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
