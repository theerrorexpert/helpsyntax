                     The  path  of  the  Amazon  DocumentDB  or MongoDB target
                     (database/collection).

                     Indicates whether to scan all the records, or  to  sample
                     rows  from the table. Scanning all the records can take a
                     long time when the table is not a high throughput  table.

                     A  value of true means to scan all records, while a value
                     of false means to sample the  records.  If  no  value  is
                     specified, the value defaults to true .

                     rows from the table. Scanning all the records can take  a
                     long  time when the table is not a high throughput table.

                     A value of true means to scan all records, while a  value
                     of  false  means  to  sample  the records. If no value is
                     specified, the value defaults to true .

                 scanRate -> (double)
                     The percentage of the configured read capacity  units  to
                     use  by  the  Glue crawler. Read capacity units is a term
                     defined by DynamoDB, and is a numeric value that acts  as
                     rate  limiter  for  the  number of reads that can be per-
                     formed on that table per second.

                     The valid values are null or a value between 0.1 to  1.5.
                     A  null value is used when user does not provide a value,
                     and defaults to 0.5 of the configured Read Capacity  Unit
                     (for  provisioned  tables), or 0.25 of the max configured
                     Read Capacity Unit (for tables using on-demand mode).

              Specifies Glue Data Catalog targets.

                 ConnectionName -> (string)
                     The name of the connection for an Amazon  S3-backed  Data
                     Catalog  table  to  be a target of the crawl when using a
                     Catalog connection type paired with a NETWORK  Connection
                     type.

          DeltaTargets -> (list)
              Specifies Delta data store targets.

                 Specifies  a  Delta  data  store  to  crawl one or more Delta
                 tables.

                 DeltaTables -> (list)
                     A list of the Amazon S3 paths to the Delta tables.

                 ConnectionName -> (string)
                     The name of the connection to use to connect to the Delta
                     table target.

                     Specifies  whether  to  write  the  manifest files to the
                     Delta table path.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
