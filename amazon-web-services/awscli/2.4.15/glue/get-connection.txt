GET-CONNECTION()                                              GET-CONNECTION()



NAME
       get-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a connection definition from the Data Catalog.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-connection
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--hide-password | --no-hide-password]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID of the Data Catalog in which the connection resides. If none
          is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by  default.

       --name (string)
          The name of the connection definition to retrieve.

       --hide-password | --no-hide-password (boolean)
          Allows you to retrieve the connection metadata without returning the
          password. For instance, the AWS  Glue  console  uses  this  flag  to
          retrieve the connection, and does not display the password. Set this
          parameter when the caller might not have permission to use  the  KMS
          key  to  decrypt the password, but it does have permission to access
          the rest of the connection properties.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              tion.

              (string)

          ConnectionProperties -> (map)
              These key-value pairs define parameters for the connection:

              o HOST  -  The  host URI: either the fully qualified domain name
                (FQDN) or the IPv4 address of the database host.

              o PORT - The port number, between 1024 and 65535, of the port on
                which the database host is listening for database connections.

              o USER_NAME - The name under which to log in  to  the  database.
                The value string for USER_NAME is "USERNAME ".

              o PASSWORD - A password, if one is used, for the user name.

              o ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD  - When you enable connection password pro-
                tection by setting ConnectionPasswordEncryption  in  the  Data
                Catalog  encryption  settings, this field stores the encrypted
                password.

              o JDBC_DRIVER_JAR_URI - The Amazon Simple Storage Service  (Ama-
                zon  S3) path of the JAR file that contains the JDBC driver to
                use.

              o JDBC_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME - The class name of the JDBC driver  to
                use.

              o JDBC_ENGINE - The name of the JDBC engine to use.

              o JDBC_ENGINE_VERSION - The version of the JDBC engine to use.

              o CONFIG_FILES - (Reserved for future use.)

              o INSTANCE_ID - The instance ID to use.

              o JDBC_CONNECTION_URL  -  The  URL for connecting to a JDBC data
                source.

              o JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL - A Boolean string (true,  false)  specifying
                whether  Secure  Sockets Layer (SSL) with hostname matching is
                enforced for the JDBC connection on the client. The default is
                false.

              o CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT  -  An Amazon S3 location specifying the cus-
                tomer's root certificate. Glue uses this root  certificate  to
                validate the customers certificate when connecting to the cus-
                tomer database. Glue only handles X.509 certificates. The cer-
                tificate  provided  must be DER-encoded and supplied in Base64
                encoding PEM format.

              o SKIP_CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_VALIDATION - By default, this is false .
                Glue  validates the Signature algorithm and Subject Public Key
                Algorithm for the customer  certificate.  The  only  permitted
                algorithms  for  the  Signature  algorithm  are SHA256withRSA,
                SHA384withRSA or SHA512withRSA. For  the  Subject  Public  Key
                Algorithm,  the  key length must be at least 2048. You can set
                the value of this property to true to skip Glues validation of
                the customer certificate.

              o CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_STRING  -  A  custom  JDBC certificate string
                which is used for domain match or distinguished name match  to
                prevent  a  man-in-the-middle attack. In Oracle database, this
                is used as the SSL_SERVER_CERT_DN ; in Microsoft  SQL  Server,
                this is used as the hostNameInCertificate .

              o CONNECTION_URL   -   The  URL  for  connecting  to  a  general
                (non-JDBC) data source.

              o KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS - A comma-separated list of  host  and
                port  pairs that are the addresses of the Apache Kafka brokers
                in a Kafka cluster to which a Kafka client will connect to and
                bootstrap itself.

              o KAFKA_SSL_ENABLED  -  Whether  to  enable or disable SSL on an
                Apache Kafka connection. Default value is "true".

              o KAFKA_CUSTOM_CERT - The Amazon S3 URL for the private CA  cert
                file (.pem format). The default is an empty string.

              o KAFKA_SKIP_CUSTOM_CERT_VALIDATION  - Whether to skip the vali-
                dation of the CA cert file or not. Glue  validates  for  three
                algorithms:  SHA256withRSA,  SHA384withRSA  and SHA512withRSA.
                Default value is "false".

              o SECRET_ID - The secret ID used for the secret manager of  cre-
                dentials.

              o CONNECTOR_URL  - The connector URL for a MARKETPLACE or CUSTOM
                connection.

              o CONNECTOR_TYPE - The connector type for a MARKETPLACE or  CUS-
                TOM connection.

              o CONNECTOR_CLASS_NAME  - The connector class name for a MARKET-
                PLACE or CUSTOM connection.

              o KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE - The Amazon S3 location of  the  client
                keystore file for Kafka client side authentication (Optional).

              o KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD - The password  to  access  the
                provided keystore (Optional).

              o KAFKA_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWORD - A keystore can consist of multiple
                keys, so this is the password to access the client key  to  be
                used with the Kafka server side key (Optional).

              o ENCRYPTED_KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD  - The encrypted ver-
                sion of the Kafka client keystore password (if  the  user  has
                the Glue encrypt passwords setting selected).

              o ENCRYPTED_KAFKA_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWORD - The encrypted version of
                the Kafka client key  password  (if  the  user  has  the  Glue
                encrypt passwords setting selected).

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The  connection's  Availability Zone. This field is redundant
                 because the specified subnet implies the Availability Zone to
                 be  used.  Currently the field must be populated, but it will
                 be deprecated in the future.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that this connection definition was created.
