SYNOPSIS
            get-schema
          --schema-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --schema-id (structure)
          This  is  a wrapper structure to contain schema identity fields. The
          structure contains:

          o SchemaId$SchemaArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  schema.
            Either  SchemaArn  or  SchemaName  and RegistryName has to be pro-
            vided.

          o SchemaId$SchemaName: The name of the schema. Either  SchemaArn  or
            SchemaName and RegistryName has to be provided.

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the schema. One of SchemaArn
              or SchemaName has to be provided.

          SchemaName -> (string)
              The name of the schema. One of SchemaArn or SchemaName has to be
              provided.

          RegistryName -> (string)
              The name of the schema registry that contains the schema.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,SchemaName=string,RegistryName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "SchemaName": "string",
            "RegistryName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RegistryName -> (string)
          The name of the registry.

       RegistryArn -> (string)

       SchemaName -> (string)
          The name of the schema.

       SchemaArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema.

       Description -> (string)
          A description of schema if specified when created

       DataFormat -> (string)

       SchemaCheckpoint -> (long)

          definition.

       NextSchemaVersion -> (long)

          definition.
