NAME
       get-data-catalog-encryption-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the security configuration for a specified catalog.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-data-catalog-encryption-settings
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Data Catalog to retrieve the security configuration
          for. If none is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used
          by default.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DataCatalogEncryptionSettings -> (structure)
          The requested security configuration.

          EncryptionAtRest -> (structure)
              Specifies the encryption-at-rest configuration for the Data Cat-
              alog.

              CatalogEncryptionMode -> (string)
                 The encryption-at-rest mode for encrypting Data Catalog data.

              SseAwsKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the KMS key to use for encryption at rest.

          ConnectionPasswordEncryption -> (structure)
              When connection password protection is enabled, the Data Catalog
              uses a customer-provided key to encrypt the password as part  of
              CreateConnection   or  UpdateConnection  and  store  it  in  the
              ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD field in the connection properties.  You  can
              enable catalog encryption or only password encryption.

              ReturnConnectionPasswordEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 When  the  ReturnConnectionPasswordEncrypted  flag  is set to
                 "true", passwords remain encrypted in the responses  of  Get-
                 Connection  and GetConnections . This encryption takes effect
                 independently from catalog encryption.

              AwsKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 An KMS key that is used to encrypt the connection password.

                 If connection password protection is enabled, the  caller  of
                 CreateConnection   and   UpdateConnection   needs   at  least
                 kms:Encrypt permission on the specified KMS key,  to  encrypt
                 passwords before storing them in the Data Catalog.

                 You  can  set  the  decrypt  permission to enable or restrict
                 access  on  the  password  key  according  to  your  security
                 requirements.
