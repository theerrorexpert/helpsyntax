GET-CONNECTIONS()                                            GET-CONNECTIONS()



NAME
       get-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of connection definitions from the Data Catalog.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-connections  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ConnectionList

SYNOPSIS
            get-connections
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--hide-password | --no-hide-password]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The ID of the Data Catalog in which the connections reside. If  none
          is  provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.

       --filter (structure)
          A filter that controls which connections are returned.

          MatchCriteria -> (list)
              A criteria string that must match the criteria recorded  in  the
              connection  definition  for  that  connection  definition  to be
              returned.

              (string)

          ConnectionType -> (string)
              The type of connections to return. Currently, SFTP is  not  sup-
              ported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MatchCriteria=string,string,ConnectionType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MatchCriteria": ["string", ...],
            "ConnectionType": "JDBC"|"SFTP"|"MONGODB"|"KAFKA"|"NETWORK"|"MARKETPLACE"|"CUSTOM"
          }

       --hide-password | --no-hide-password (boolean)
          Allows you to retrieve the connection metadata without returning the
          password. For instance, the AWS  Glue  console  uses  this  flag  to
          retrieve the connection, and does not display the password. Set this
          parameter when the caller might not have permission to use  the  KMS
          key  to  decrypt the password, but it does have permission to access
          the rest of the connection properties.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              ConnectionProperties -> (map)
                 These key-value pairs define parameters for the connection:

                 o HOST - The host URI: either the fully qualified domain name
                   (FQDN) or the IPv4 address of the database host.

                 o PORT - The port number, between 1024 and 65535, of the port
                   on  which  the database host is listening for database con-
                   nections.

                 o USER_NAME - The name under which to log in to the database.
                   The value string for USER_NAME is "USERNAME ".

                 o PASSWORD - A password, if one is used, for the user name.

                 o ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD  -  When  you enable connection password
                   protection by setting ConnectionPasswordEncryption  in  the
                   Data  Catalog  encryption  settings,  this field stores the
                   encrypted password.

                 o JDBC_DRIVER_JAR_URI - The  Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service
                   (Amazon  S3)  path  of  the JAR file that contains the JDBC
                   driver to use.

                 o JDBC_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME - The class name of the JDBC  driver
                   to use.

                 o JDBC_ENGINE - The name of the JDBC engine to use.

                 o JDBC_ENGINE_VERSION  -  The  version  of the JDBC engine to
                   use.

                 o CONFIG_FILES - (Reserved for future use.)

                 o INSTANCE_ID - The instance ID to use.

                 o JDBC_CONNECTION_URL - The URL for connecting to a JDBC data
                   source.

                 o JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL  - A Boolean string (true, false) specify-
                   ing whether Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with hostname match-
                   ing  is enforced for the JDBC connection on the client. The
                   default is false.

                 o CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT - An Amazon  S3  location  specifying  the
                   customer's  root  certificate. Glue uses this root certifi-
                   cate to validate the customers certificate when  connecting
                   to  the customer database. Glue only handles X.509 certifi-
                   cates. The certificate provided  must  be  DER-encoded  and
                   supplied in Base64 encoding PEM format.

                 o SKIP_CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_VALIDATION  -  By  default,  this  is
                   false . Glue validates the Signature algorithm and  Subject
                   Public Key Algorithm for the customer certificate. The only
                   permitted  algorithms  for  the  Signature  algorithm   are
                   SHA256withRSA, SHA384withRSA or SHA512withRSA. For the Sub-
                   ject Public Key Algorithm, the key length must be at  least
                   2048.  You  can  set  the value of this property to true to
                   skip Glues validation of the customer certificate.

                 o CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_STRING - A custom JDBC certificate  string
                   which  is used for domain match or distinguished name match
                   to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. In Oracle  database,
                   this  is  used as the SSL_SERVER_CERT_DN ; in Microsoft SQL
                   Server, this is used as the hostNameInCertificate .

                 o CONNECTION_URL -  The  URL  for  connecting  to  a  general
                   (non-JDBC) data source.

                 o KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS  -  A  comma-separated list of host
                   and port pairs that are the addresses of the  Apache  Kafka
                   brokers  in  a  Kafka  cluster to which a Kafka client will
                   connect to and bootstrap itself.

                 o KAFKA_SSL_ENABLED - Whether to enable or disable SSL on  an
                   Apache Kafka connection. Default value is "true".

                 o KAFKA_CUSTOM_CERT  -  The  Amazon S3 URL for the private CA
                   cert file (.pem format). The default is an empty string.

                 o KAFKA_SKIP_CUSTOM_CERT_VALIDATION -  Whether  to  skip  the
                   validation  of  the CA cert file or not. Glue validates for
                   three   algorithms:   SHA256withRSA,   SHA384withRSA    and
                   SHA512withRSA. Default value is "false".

                 o SECRET_ID  -  The  secret ID used for the secret manager of
                   credentials.

                 o CONNECTOR_URL - The connector URL for a MARKETPLACE or CUS-
                   TOM connection.

                   KETPLACE or CUSTOM connection.

                 o KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE  -  The  Amazon  S3  location  of the
                   client keystore file for Kafka client  side  authentication
                   (Optional).

                 o KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD - The password to access the
                   provided keystore (Optional).

                 o KAFKA_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWORD - A keystore can consist of  mul-
                   tiple  keys,  so  this is the password to access the client
                   key to be used with the Kafka server side key (Optional).

                 o ENCRYPTED_KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD  -  The  encrypted
                   version  of the Kafka client keystore password (if the user

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              PhysicalConnectionRequirements -> (structure)
                 A map of physical connection requirements,  such  as  virtual
                 private  cloud  (VPC)  and SecurityGroup , that are needed to
                 make this connection successfully.

                 SubnetId -> (string)
                     The subnet ID used by the connection.

                 SecurityGroupIdList -> (list)
                     The security group ID list used by the connection.

                     (string)

                 AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                     The connection's Availability Zone. This field is  redun-
                     dant  because the specified subnet implies the Availabil-
                     ity Zone to be used. Currently the field  must  be  popu-
                     lated, but it will be deprecated in the future.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)

                 definition.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, if the list of connections returned  does  not
          include the last of the filtered connections.
