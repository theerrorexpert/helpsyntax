REGISTER-SCHEMA-VERSION()                            REGISTER-SCHEMA-VERSION()



NAME
       register-schema-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds a new version to the existing schema. Returns an error if new ver-
       sion of schema does not meet  the  compatibility  requirements  of  the
       schema set. This API will not create a new schema set and will return a
       404 error if the schema set is not already present in the  Schema  Reg-
       istry.

       If  this  is the first schema definition to be registered in the Schema
       Registry, this API will store the schema  version  and  return  immedi-
       ately.  Otherwise, this call has the potential to run longer than other
       operations due to compatibility modes. You can call  the  GetSchemaVer-
       sion API with the SchemaVersionId to check compatibility modes.

       If the same schema definition is already stored in Schema Registry as a
       version, the schema ID of  the  existing  schema  is  returned  to  the
       caller.

SYNOPSIS
            register-schema-version
          --schema-id <value>
          --schema-definition <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --schema-id (structure)
          This  is  a wrapper structure to contain schema identity fields. The
          structure contains:

          o SchemaId$SchemaArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  schema.
            Either  SchemaArn  or  SchemaName  and RegistryName has to be pro-
            vided.

          o SchemaId$SchemaName: The name of the schema. Either  SchemaArn  or
            SchemaName and RegistryName has to be provided.

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the schema. One of SchemaArn
              or SchemaName has to be provided.

          SchemaName -> (string)
              The name of the schema. One of SchemaArn or SchemaName has to be
              provided.

          RegistryName -> (string)
              The name of the schema registry that contains the schema.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,SchemaName=string,RegistryName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "SchemaName": "string",
            "RegistryName": "string"
          }

       --schema-definition (string)
          The  schema  definition  using the DataFormat setting for the Schem-
          aName .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SchemaVersionId -> (string)
          The unique ID that represents the version of this schema.

       VersionNumber -> (long)
          The version of this schema (for sync flow only, in case this is  the
          first version).

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the schema version.
