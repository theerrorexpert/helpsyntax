NAME
       get-crawler -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata for a specified crawler.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-crawler
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the crawler to retrieve metadata for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     ScanAll -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether to scan all the records, or to  sam-
                        ple  rows from the table. Scanning all the records can
                        take a long time when the table is not a high through-
                        put table.

                        A  value  of  true  means to scan all records, while a
                        value of false means to  sample  the  records.  If  no

                        put table.

                        A value of true means to scan  all  records,  while  a

                        be performed on that table per second.

                        The valid values are null or a value  between  0.1  to
                        1.5. A null value is used when user does not provide a
                        value, and defaults to  0.5  of  the  configured  Read
                        Capacity Unit (for provisioned tables), or 0.25 of the
                        max configured Read Capacity Unit  (for  tables  using
                        on-demand mode).
