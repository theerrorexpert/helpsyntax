LIST-SCHEMA-VERSIONS()                                  LIST-SCHEMA-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-schema-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of schema versions that you have created, with minimal
       information. Schema versions in Deleted status will not be included  in
       the results. Empty results will be returned if there are no schema ver-
       sions available.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-schema-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Schemas

SYNOPSIS
            list-schema-versions
          --schema-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --schema-id (structure)
          This  is  a wrapper structure to contain schema identity fields. The
          structure contains:

          o SchemaId$SchemaArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  schema.
            Either  SchemaArn  or  SchemaName  and RegistryName has to be pro-
            vided.

          o SchemaId$SchemaName: The name of the schema. Either  SchemaArn  or
            SchemaName and RegistryName has to be provided.

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the schema. One of SchemaArn
              or SchemaName has to be provided.

          SchemaName -> (string)
              The name of the schema. One of SchemaArn or SchemaName has to be
              provided.

          RegistryName -> (string)
              The name of the schema registry that contains the schema.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,SchemaName=string,RegistryName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "SchemaName": "string",
            "RegistryName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Schemas -> (list)
          An array of SchemaVersionList objects  containing  details  of  each
          schema version.

          (structure)
              An object containing the details about a schema version.

              SchemaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema.

              SchemaVersionId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the schema version.

              VersionNumber -> (long)
                 The version number of the schema.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the schema version.

              CreatedTime -> (string)
                 The date and time the schema version was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  continuation  token  for  paginating the returned list of tokens,
          returned if the current segment of the list is not the last.
