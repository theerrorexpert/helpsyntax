GET-ML-TASK-RUNS()                                          GET-ML-TASK-RUNS()



NAME
       get-ml-task-runs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a list of runs for a machine learning transform. Machine learning
       task runs are asynchronous tasks that Glue runs on your behalf as  part
       of  various machine learning workflows. You can get a sortable, filter-
       able list of machine learning task runs by calling  GetMLTaskRuns  with
       their  parent  transform's TransformID and other optional parameters as
       documented in this section.

       This operation returns a list of historic runs and must be paginated.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --transform-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.

       --next-token (string)
          A token for pagination of the results. The default is empty.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.

       --filter (structure)
          The filter criteria, in the TaskRunFilterCriteria structure, for the
          task run.

          TaskRunType -> (string)
              The type of task run.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the task run.

          StartedBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filter on task runs started before this date.

          StartedAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filter on task runs started after this date.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TaskRunType=string,Status=string,StartedBefore=timestamp,StartedAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TaskRunType": "EVALUATION"|"LABELING_SET_GENERATION"|"IMPORT_LABELS"|"EXPORT_LABELS"|"FIND_MATCHES",
            "Status": "STARTING"|"RUNNING"|"STOPPING"|"STOPPED"|"SUCCEEDED"|"FAILED"|"TIMEOUT",
            "StartedBefore": timestamp,
            "StartedAfter": timestamp
          }

       --sort (structure)
          The  sorting criteria, in the TaskRunSortCriteria structure, for the
          task run.

          Column -> (string)
              The column to be used to sort the list  of  task  runs  for  the
              machine learning transform.

          SortDirection -> (string)
              The  sort direction to be used to sort the list of task runs for
              the machine learning transform.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Column=string,SortDirection=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Column": "TASK_RUN_TYPE"|"STATUS"|"STARTED",
            "SortDirection": "DESCENDING"|"ASCENDING"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
