GET-ML-TASK-RUN()                                            GET-ML-TASK-RUN()



NAME
       get-ml-task-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  details  for a specific task run on a machine learning transform.
       Machine learning task runs are asynchronous tasks  that  Glue  runs  on
       your  behalf  as  part  of  various machine learning workflows. You can
       check the stats of any  task  run  by  calling  GetMLTaskRun  with  the
       TaskRunID and its parent transform's TransformID .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ml-task-run
          --transform-id <value>
          --task-run-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transform-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.

       --task-run-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the task run.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
