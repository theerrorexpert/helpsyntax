DELETE-LENS-SHARE()                                        DELETE-LENS-SHARE()



NAME
       delete-lens-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete a lens share.

       After  the  lens share is deleted, Amazon Web Services accounts and IAM
       users that you shared the lens with can continue to use  it,  but  they
       will no longer be able to apply it to new workloads.

       NOTE:
              Disclaimer

          By  sharing  your  custom  lenses  with  other  Amazon  Web Services
          accounts, you acknowledge that Amazon Web Services  will  make  your
          custom  lenses  available  to  those  other  accounts.  Those  other
          accounts may continue to access and use your  shared  custom  lenses
          even  if  you delete the custom lenses from your own Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account or terminate your Amazon Web Services account.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-lens-share
          --share-id <value>
          --lens-alias <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --share-id (string)
          The ID associated with the workload share.

       --lens-alias (string)
          The alias of the lens, for example, serverless .

          Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure that this  request  is
          idempotent (executes only once).

          You should not reuse the same token for other requests. If you retry
          a request with the same client request token and the same parameters
          after  it  has  completed  successfully,  the result of the original
          request is returned.

          WARNING:
              This token is listed as required, however, if you do not specify
              it,  the Amazon Web Services SDKs automatically generate one for
              you. If you are not using the Amazon Web  Services  SDK  or  the
              CLI, you must provide this token or the request will fail.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
