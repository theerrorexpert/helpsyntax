SYNOPSIS
            update-lens-review
          --workload-id <value>
          --lens-alias <value>
          [--lens-notes <value>]
          [--pillar-notes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workload-id (string)
          The  ID assigned to the workload. This ID is unique within an Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --lens-alias (string)
          The alias of the lens, for example, serverless .

          Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

       --lens-notes (string)
          The notes associated with the workload.

       --pillar-notes (map)
          List of pillar notes of a lens review in a workload.

          key -> (string)
              The ID used to identify a pillar, for example, security .

              A pillar is identified by its  PillarReviewSummary$PillarId .

          value -> (string)
              The notes associated with the workload.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
