NAME
       list-workloads -

DESCRIPTION
       List workloads. Paginated.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-workloads
          [--workload-name-prefix <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workload-name-prefix (string)
          An  optional  string  added  to  the beginning of each workload name
          returned in the results.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return for this request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              WorkloadName -> (string)
                 The name of the workload.

                 The  name  must  be unique within an account within an Amazon

              Lenses -> (list)
                 The list of lenses associated with the workload. Each lens is
                 identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

                 (string)
                     The alias of the lens, for example, serverless .

                     Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

              RiskCounts -> (map)
                 A map from risk names to the count of how questions have that
                 rating.

                 key -> (string)
                     The  risk  for  a given workload, lens review, pillar, or
                     question.

                 value -> (integer)
                     A non-negative integer that denotes how many.

              ImprovementStatus -> (string)
