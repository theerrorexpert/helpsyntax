GET-ENTITLEMENTS()                                          GET-ENTITLEMENTS()



NAME
       get-entitlements -

DESCRIPTION
       GetEntitlements  retrieves  entitlement values for a given product. The
       results can be filtered based on customer identifier or product  dimen-
       sions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-entitlements  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Entitlements

SYNOPSIS
            get-entitlements
          --product-code <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --product-code (string)
          Product code is used to uniquely identify a product in  AWS  Market-
          place. The product code will be provided by AWS Marketplace when the
          product listing is created.

       --filter (map)
          Filter is used to return entitlements for a specific customer or for
          a  specific  dimension.  Filters  are  described as keys mapped to a
          lists of values. Filtered requests are unioned for each value in the
          value list, and then intersected for each filter key.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

          Where valid key names are:
            CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER
            DIMENSION

       JSON Syntax:

          {"CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER"|"DIMENSION": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Entitlements -> (list)
          The set of entitlements found through the GetEntitlements operation.
          If the result contains an empty set of entitlements, NextToken might
          still be present and should be used.

          (structure)
              An entitlement represents capacity in a  product  owned  by  the
              customer. For example, a customer might own some number of users
              or seats in an SaaS application or some amount of data  capacity
              in a multi-tenant database.

              ProductCode -> (string)
                 The  product  code  for  which the given entitlement applies.
                 Product codes are provided by AWS Marketplace when the  prod-
                 uct listing is created.

              Dimension -> (string)
                 The dimension for which the given entitlement applies. Dimen-
                 sions represent categories of capacity in a product  and  are
                 specified when the product is listed in AWS Marketplace.

              CustomerIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  customer  identifier is a handle to each unique customer
                 in an application. Customer identifiers are obtained  through
                 the  ResolveCustomer  operation  in  AWS Marketplace Metering
                 Service.

              Value -> (structure)
                 The EntitlementValue represents the amount of  capacity  that
                 the customer is entitled to for the product.

                 IntegerValue -> (integer)
                     The  IntegerValue field will be populated with an integer
                     value when the entitlement is an integer type. Otherwise,
                     the field will not be set.

                 DoubleValue -> (double)
                     The  DoubleValue  field  will  be populated with a double
                     value when the entitlement is a double  type.  Otherwise,
                     the field will not be set.

                 BooleanValue -> (boolean)
                     The  BooleanValue  field will be populated with a boolean
                     value when the entitlement is a boolean type.  Otherwise,
                     the field will not be set.

                 StringValue -> (string)
                     The  StringValue  field  will  be populated with a string
                     value when the entitlement is a string  type.  Otherwise,
                     the field will not be set.

              ExpirationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The expiration date represents the minimum date through which
                 this entitlement is expected to remain valid. For contractual
                 products  listed  on  AWS Marketplace, the expiration date is
                 the date at which the customer will  renew  or  cancel  their
                 contract.  Customers  who  are opting to renew their contract
                 will still have entitlements with an expiration date.

       NextToken -> (string)
          For paginated results, use NextToken in subsequent calls to GetEnti-
          tlements. If the result contains an empty set of entitlements, Next-
          Token might still be present and should be used.
