NAME
       list-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the Recycle Bin retention rules in the Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-rules  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Rules

SYNOPSIS
            list-rules
          --resource-type <value>
          [--resource-tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The resource type retained by the  retention  rule.  Only  retention
          rules that retain the specified resource type are listed.

          Possible values:

          o EBS_SNAPSHOT

       --resource-tags (list)
          The  tags  used to identify resources that are to be retained by the
          retention rule.

          (structure)
              Information about a resource tag used to identify resources that
              are to be retained by a Recycle Bin retention rule.

              ResourceTagKey -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              ResourceTagValue -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceTagKey=string,ResourceTagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceTagKey": "string",
              "ResourceTagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Rules -> (list)
          Information about the retention rules.

          (structure)
              Information about a Recycle Bin retention rule.

              Identifier -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the retention rule.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description for the retention rule.

              RetentionPeriod -> (structure)
                 Information about the retention period for which  the  reten-
                 tion rule retains resources

                 RetentionPeriodValue -> (integer)
                     The  period  value  for  which  the  retention rule is to
                     retain resources. The period is measured using  the  unit
                     specified for RetentionPeriodUnit .

                 RetentionPeriodUnit -> (string)
                     The  unit  of  time in which the retention period is mea-
                     sured. Currently, only DAYS is supported.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
