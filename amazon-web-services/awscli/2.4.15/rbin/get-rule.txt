GET-RULE()                                                          GET-RULE()



NAME
       get-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a Recycle Bin retention rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rule
          --identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          The unique ID of the retention rule.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Identifier -> (string)
          The unique ID of the retention rule.

          The description assigned to the retention rule.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The  resource  type  retained by the retention rule. Currently, only
          Amazon EBS snapshots are supported.

       RetentionPeriod -> (structure)
          Information about the period for which the  retention  rule  retains
          resources.

          RetentionPeriodValue -> (integer)
              The  period  value  for  which  the  retention rule is to retain
              resources. The period is measured using the unit  specified  for
              RetentionPeriodUnit .

          RetentionPeriodUnit -> (string)
              The unit of time in which the retention period is measured. Cur-
              rently, only DAYS is supported.

       ResourceTags -> (list)
          The resource tags used to identify resources that are to be retained
          by the retention rule.

          (structure)
              Information about a resource tag used to identify resources that
              are to be retained by a Recycle Bin retention rule.

              ResourceTagKey -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              ResourceTagValue -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Status -> (string)
