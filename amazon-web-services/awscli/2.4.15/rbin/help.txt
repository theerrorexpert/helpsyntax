DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  Recycle  Bin API Reference . This documentation provides
       descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in Recy-
       cle Bin.

       Recycle  Bin is a snapshot recovery feature that enables you to restore
       accidentally deleted snapshots. When using Recycle Bin, if  your  snap-
       shots  are  deleted,  they  are  retained in the Recycle Bin for a time
       period that you specify.

       You can restore a snapshot from the Recycle Bin at any time before  its
       retention period expires. After you restore a snapshot from the Recycle
       Bin, the snapshot is removed from the Recycle Bin, and you can then use
       it  in  the same way you use any other snapshot in your account. If the
       retention period expires and the snapshot is not restored, the snapshot
       is  permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and is no longer available
       for recovery. For more information about Recycle Bin, see  Recycle  Bin
       in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .
