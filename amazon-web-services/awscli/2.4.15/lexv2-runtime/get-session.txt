NAME
       get-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns session information for a specified bot, alias, and user.

       For example, you can use this operation to retrieve session information
       for a user that has left a long-running session in use.

       If the bot, alias, or session identifier doesn't exist, Amazon  Lex  V2
       returns  a  BadRequestException . If the locale doesn't exist or is not
       enabled for the alias, you receive a BadRequestException .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-session
          --bot-id <value>
          --bot-alias-id <value>
          --locale-id <value>
          --session-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot that contains the session data.

       --bot-alias-id (string)
          The alias identifier in use for the bot that  contains  the  session
          data.

       --locale-id (string)
          The locale where the session is in use.

       --session-id (string)
          The identifier of the session to return.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        value is Scalar , it indicates that  the  value  field
                        contains a single value.

                     values -> (list)
                        A  list  of  one or more values that the user provided
                        for the slot. For example, if a for a slot that  elic-
                        its  pizza  toppings,  the values might be "pepperoni"
                        and "pineapple."

                            A value that Amazon Lex  V2  uses  to  fulfill  an
                            intent.

                            value -> (structure)
                               The current value of the slot.

                               originalValue -> (string)
                                   The  text  of  the  utterance from the user
                                   that was entered for the slot.

                               interpretedValue -> (string)
                                   The value that Amazon Lex V2 determines for
                                   the  slot.  The actual value depends on the
                                   setting of the value selection strategy for
                                   the  bot.  You  can choose to use the value
                                   entered by the user, or you can have Amazon
                                   Lex  V2  choose  the  first  value  in  the
                                   resolvedValues list.

                               resolvedValues -> (list)

                            shape -> (string)
                               When  the  shape  value  is List , it indicates
                               that the values field contains a list  of  slot
                               values. When the value is Scalar , it indicates
                               that the value field contains a single value.

                            values -> (list)
                               A list of one or more values that the user pro-
                               vided  for  the  slot.  For example, if a for a
                               slot that elicits pizza  toppings,  the  values
                               might be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                               ( ... recursive ... )

              state -> (string)
                 Contains fulfillment information for the intent.

              confirmationState -> (string)
                 Contains  information about whether fulfillment of the intent
                 has been confirmed.

          activeContexts -> (list)
              One or more contexts that indicate to Amazon Lex V2 the  context
              of  a request. When a context is active, Amazon Lex V2 considers
              intents with the matching context  as  a  trigger  as  the  next
              intent in a session.

              (structure)
                 Contains  information about the contexts that a user is using
                 in a session. You can configure Amazon Lex V2 to set  a  con-
                 text  when  an  intent is fulfilled, or you can set a context
                 using the , , or operations.

                 Use a context to indicate  to  Amazon  Lex  V2  intents  that
                 should  be  used  as  follow-up  intents. For example, if the
                 active context is order-fulfilled , only  intents  that  have
                 order-fulfilled  configured  as  a trigger are considered for
                 follow up.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the context.

                 timeToLive -> (structure)
                     Indicates the number of turns or seconds that the context
                     is  active. Once the time to live expires, the context is
                     no longer returned in a response.

                     timeToLiveInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The number of seconds that the context is active.  You
                        can specify between 5 and 86400 seconds (24 hours).

                     turnsToLive -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  turns that the context is active. You
                        can specify up to 20 turns. Each request and  response
                        from the bot is a turn.

                 contextAttributes -> (map)
                     A  list of contexts active for the request. A context can
                     be activated when a previous intent is fulfilled,  or  by
                     including the context in the request.

                     If  you  don't  specify a list of contexts, Amazon Lex V2
                     will use the current list of contexts for the session. If
                     you  specify  an empty list, all contexts for the session
                     are cleared.

              of a slot.

              slotHints -> (map)
                 A list of the slots in the intent that  should  have  runtime
                 hints  added,  and  the phrases that should be added for each
                 slot.

                 The first level of the slotHints  map  is  the  name  of  the
                 intent.  The  second level is the name of the slot within the
                 intent. For more information,  see  Using  hints  to  improve
                 accuracy .
