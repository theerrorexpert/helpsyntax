       --session-state (structure)
          Sets the state of the session with the user. You can use this to set
          the  current intent, attributes, context, and dialog action. Use the
          dialog action to determine the next step that Amazon Lex  V2  should
          use in the conversation with the user.

          dialogAction -> (structure)
              The next step that Amazon Lex V2 should take in the conversation

                 The next action that the bot should take in  its  interaction
                 with the user. The possible values are:

                 o Close  -  Indicates  that there will not be a response from
                   the user. For example, the statement "Your order  has  been
                   placed" does not require a response.

                 o ConfirmIntent  -  The next action is asking the user if the
                   intent is complete and ready to be  fulfilled.  This  is  a
                   yes/no question such as "Place the order?"

                 o Delegate  - The next action is determined by Amazon Lex V2.

                 o ElicitSlot - The next action is to elicit a slot value from
                   the user.

              slotToElicit -> (string)
                 The name of the slot that should be elicited from the user.

              slotElicitationStyle -> (string)
                 Configures  the  slot to use spell-by-letter or spell-by-word
                 style. When you use a style on a slot, users  can  spell  out
                 their input to make it clear to your bot.

                 o Spell by letter - "b" "o" "b"

                 o Spell by word - "b as in boy" "o as in oscar" "b as in boy"

                 For more information, see Using spelling to enter slot values
                 .

              slots -> (map)
                 A  map  of  all  of the slots for the intent. The name of the

                 filled, the value is null.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     A value that Amazon Lex V2 uses to fulfill an intent.

                     value -> (structure)
                        The current value of the slot.

                        originalValue -> (string)
                            The  text  of the utterance from the user that was
                            entered for the slot.

                        interpretedValue -> (string)
                            The value that Amazon Lex V2  determines  for  the
                            slot.  The  actual value depends on the setting of
                            the value selection strategy for the bot. You  can
                            choose  to  use  the value entered by the user, or
                            you can have Amazon Lex V2 choose the first  value
                            in the resolvedValues list.

                     shape -> (string)
                        When the shape value is List , it indicates  that  the
                        values  field contains a list of slot values. When the
                        value is Scalar , it indicates that  the  value  field
                        contains a single value.

                     values -> (list)
                        A  list  of  one or more values that the user provided
                        for the slot. For example, if a for a slot that  elic-
                        its  pizza  toppings,  the values might be "pepperoni"

                                   The  text  of  the  utterance from the user
                                   that was entered for the slot.

                               interpretedValue -> (string)
                                   The value that Amazon Lex V2 determines for
                                   the  slot.  The actual value depends on the
                                   setting of the value selection strategy for
                                   the  bot.  You  can choose to use the value
                                   entered by the user, or you can have Amazon

                                   resolvedValues list.

                               resolvedValues -> (list)

                            shape -> (string)
                               When  the  shape  value  is List , it indicates
                               that the values field contains a list  of  slot
                               values. When the value is Scalar , it indicates
                               that the value field contains a single value.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

              state -> (string)
                 Contains fulfillment information for the intent.

              confirmationState -> (string)
                 Contains  information about whether fulfillment of the intent
                 has been confirmed.

          activeContexts -> (list)
              One or more contexts that indicate to Amazon Lex V2 the  context
              of  a request. When a context is active, Amazon Lex V2 considers
              intents with the matching context  as  a  trigger  as  the  next
              intent in a session.

              (structure)
                 Contains  information about the contexts that a user is using
                 in a session. You can configure Amazon Lex V2 to set  a  con-
                 text  when  an  intent is fulfilled, or you can set a context
                 using the , , or operations.

                 Use a context to indicate  to  Amazon  Lex  V2  intents  that
                 should  be  used  as  follow-up  intents. For example, if the
                 active context is order-fulfilled , only  intents  that  have
                 order-fulfilled  configured  as  a trigger are considered for
                 follow up.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the context.

                 timeToLive -> (structure)
                     Indicates the number of turns or seconds that the context
                     is  active. Once the time to live expires, the context is
                     no longer returned in a response.

                     timeToLiveInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The number of seconds that the context is active.  You
                        can specify between 5 and 86400 seconds (24 hours).

                     turnsToLive -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  turns that the context is active. You
                        can specify up to 20 turns. Each request and  response
                        from the bot is a turn.

                 contextAttributes -> (map)
                     A  list of contexts active for the request. A context can
                     be activated when a previous intent is fulfilled,  or  by
                     including the context in the request.

                     If  you  don't  specify a list of contexts, Amazon Lex V2
                     will use the current list of contexts for the session. If
                     you  specify  an empty list, all contexts for the session
                     are cleared.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

          sessionAttributes -> (map)
              Map of key/value  pairs  representing  session-specific  context
              information.  It contains application information passed between
              Amazon Lex V2 and a client application.

              value -> (string)

              A unique identifier for a specific request.

          runtimeHints -> (structure)
              Hints for phrases that a customer is likely to use for  a  slot.
              Amazon Lex V2 uses the hints to help determine the correct value
              of a slot.

              slotHints -> (map)
                 A list of the slots in the intent that  should  have  runtime
                 hints  added,  and  the phrases that should be added for each
                 slot.

                 The first level of the slotHints  map  is  the  name  of  the
                 intent.  The  second level is the name of the slot within the
                 intent. For more information,  see  Using  hints  to  improve
                 accuracy .

                 The intent name and slot name must exist.

                            One or more strings that Amazon Lex V2 should look
                            for  in the input to the bot. Each phrase is given
                            preference when deciding on slot values.

                            (structure)
                               Provides the phrase that Amazon Lex  V2  should
                               look for in the user's input to the bot.

                               phrase -> (string)
                                   The  phrase  that Amazon Lex V2 should look
