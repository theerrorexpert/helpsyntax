UPDATE-JOB()                                                      UPDATE-JOB()



NAME
       update-job -

DESCRIPTION
       You use this operation to change the parameters specified in the origi-
       nal manifest file by supplying a new manifest file. The  manifest  file
       attached  to  this request replaces the original manifest file. You can
       only use the operation after a CreateJob request but  before  the  data
       transfer starts and you can only use it on jobs you own.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-job
          --job-id <value>
          --manifest <value>
          --job-type <value>
          --validate-only | --no-validate-only
          [--api-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string) A unique identifier which refers to a particular job.

       --manifest (string) The UTF-8 encoded text of the manifest file.

       --job-type (string) Specifies whether the job to initiate is an  import
       or export job.
          Possible values:

          o Import

          o Export

       --validate-only  |  --no-validate-only  (boolean) Validate the manifest
       and parameter values in the request but do not actually create a job.

       --api-version (string) Specifies the version of the client tool.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command updates the specified job:

          aws importexport update-job --job-id EX1ID --job-type import --manifest file://manifest.txt --no-validate-only

       The output for the update-jobs command looks like the following:

          True    **** Device will be erased before being returned. ****

       With this command, you can either modify the original manifest you sub-
       mitted, or you can start over and create a new manifest file. In either
       case, the original manifest is discarded.

OUTPUT
       Success -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether (true) or not (false)  AWS  Import/Export  updated
          your job.

       WarningMessage -> (string)
          An  optional message notifying you of non-fatal issues with the job,
          such as use of an incompatible Amazon S3 bucket name.

       ArtifactList -> (list)
          A collection of artifacts.

          (structure)
              A discrete item that contains the  description  and  URL  of  an
              artifact (such as a PDF).

              Description -> (string)
                 The associated description for this object.

              URL -> (string)
                 The URL for a given Artifact.
