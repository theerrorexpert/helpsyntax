GET-STATUS()                                                      GET-STATUS()



NAME
       get-status -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation returns information about a job, including where the job
       is in the processing pipeline, the status of the results, and the  sig-
       nature  value  associated with the job. You can only return information
       about jobs you own.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-status
          --job-id <value>
          [--api-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string) A unique identifier which refers to a particular job.

       --api-version (string) Specifies the version of the client tool.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command returns the status the specified job:

          aws importexport get-status  --job-id EX1ID

       The output for the get-status command looks like the following:

       When  you ship your device, it will be delivered to a sorting facility,
       and then forwarded on to an AWS data center. Note that when you send  a
       get-status  command,  the  status  of  your job will not show as At AWS
       until the shipment has been received at the AWS data center.
