CREATE-JOB()                                                      CREATE-JOB()



NAME
       create-job -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  initiates the process of scheduling an upload or down-
       load of your data. You include in the request a manifest that describes
       the data transfer specifics. The response to the request includes a job
       ID, which you can use in other operations, a signature that you use  to
       identify  your  storage  device,  and the address where you should ship
       your storage device.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-job
          --job-type <value>
          --manifest <value>
          [--manifest-addendum <value>]
          --validate-only | --no-validate-only
          [--api-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-type (string) Specifies whether the job to initiate is an  import
       or export job.
          Possible values:

          o Import

          o Export

       --manifest (string) The UTF-8 encoded text of the manifest file.

       --manifest-addendum (string) For internal use only.

       --validate-only  |  --no-validate-only  (boolean) Validate the manifest
       and parameter values in the request but do not actually create a job.

       --api-version (string) Specifies the version of the client tool.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command creates an import job from a manifest file:

          aws importexport create-job --job-type import --manifest file://manifest --no-validate-only

       The file manifest is a YAML formatted text file in the  current  direc-
       tory with the following content:

          manifestVersion: 2.0;
          returnAddress:
          name: Jane Roe
          company: Example Corp.
          street1: 123 Any Street
          city: Anytown
          stateOrProvince: WA
          postalCode: 91011-1111
          phoneNumber: 206-555-1111
          country: USA
          deviceId: 49382
          eraseDevice: yes
          notificationEmail: john.doe@example.com;jane.roe@example.com
          bucket: myBucket

       For  more  information on the manifest file format, see Creating Import
       Manifests in the AWS Import/Export Developer Guide.

       You can also pass the manifest as a string in quotes:

          aws importexport create-job --job-type import --manifest 'manifestVersion: 2.0;
           returnAddress:
           name: Jane Roe
           company: Example Corp.
           street1: 123 Any Street
           city: Anytown
           stateOrProvince: WA
           postalCode: 91011-1111
           phoneNumber: 206-555-1111
           country: USA
           deviceId: 49382
           eraseDevice: yes
           notificationEmail: john.doe@example.com;jane.roe@example.com
           bucket: myBucket'
