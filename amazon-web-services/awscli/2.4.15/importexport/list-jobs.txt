LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns  the  jobs  associated with the requester. AWS
       Import/Export lists the jobs in reverse chronological  order  based  on
       the  date  of  creation. For example if Job Test1 was created 2009Dec30
       and Test2 was created 2010Feb05, the ListJobs  operation  would  return
       Test2 followed by Test1.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Jobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          [--api-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-version (string) Specifies the version of the client tool.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command lists the jobs you've created:

          aws importexport list-jobs

       The output for the list-jobs command looks like the following:

          JOBS    2015-05-27T18:58:21Z    False   EX1ID   Import

       You  can  only list jobs created by users under the AWS account you are
       currently using. Listing jobs returns useful information, like job IDs,
       which are necessary for other AWS Import/Export commands.

OUTPUT
       Jobs -> (list)
          A list container for Jobs returned by the ListJobs operation.

          (structure)
              Representation of a job returned by the ListJobs operation.

              JobId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier which refers to a particular job.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp  of  the  CreateJob request in ISO8601 date format.
                 For example "2010-03-28T20:27:35Z".

              IsCanceled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the job was canceled.

              JobType -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the job to initiate is an import or  export
                 job.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the list of jobs was truncated. If true, then call
          ListJobs again using the last JobId element as the marker.
