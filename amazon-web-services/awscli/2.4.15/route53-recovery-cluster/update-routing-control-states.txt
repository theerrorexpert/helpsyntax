UPDATE-ROUTING-CONTROL-STATES()                UPDATE-ROUTING-CONTROL-STATES()



NAME
       update-routing-control-states -

DESCRIPTION
       Set  multiple  routing  control  states. You can set the value for each
       state to be On or Off. When the state is On, traffic flows to  a  cell.
       When it's off, traffic does not flow.

       For  more  information about working with routing controls, see Routing
       control in the  Route  53  Application  Recovery  Controller  Developer
       Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-routing-control-states
          --update-routing-control-state-entries <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --update-routing-control-state-entries (list)
          A set of routing control entries that you want to update.

          (structure)
              A routing control state.

              RoutingControlArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Number  (ARN)  for the routing control
                 state entry.

              RoutingControlState -> (string)
                 The routing control state in a set of routing  control  state
                 entries.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RoutingControlArn=string,RoutingControlState=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RoutingControlArn": "string",
              "RoutingControlState": "On"|"Off"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
