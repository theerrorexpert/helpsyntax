NAME
       list-anomaly-group-related-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of measures that are potential causes or effects of an
       anomaly group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-anomaly-group-related-metrics
          --anomaly-detector-arn <value>
          --anomaly-group-id <value>
          [--relationship-type-filter <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --anomaly-detector-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the anomaly detector.

       --anomaly-group-id (string)
          The ID of the anomaly group.

       --relationship-type-filter (string)
          Filter for potential causes (CAUSE_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP ) or down-
          stream  effects  (EFFECT_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP  )  of  the  anomaly
          group.

          Possible values:

          o CAUSE_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP

          o EFFECT_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.

       --next-token (string)
          Specify the pagination token that's returned by a  previous  request
          to retrieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InterMetricImpactList -> (list)
          Aggregated  details  about  the measures contributing to the anomaly
          group, and the measures potentially impacted by the anomaly group.

          (structure)
              Aggregated details about the measures contributing to the  anom-
              aly  group, and the measures potentially impacted by the anomaly
              group.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the measure.

              AnomalyGroupId -> (string)
                 The ID of the anomaly group.

              RelationshipType -> (string)
                 Whether a measure is a potential cause of the  anomaly  group
                 (CAUSE_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP  ),  or  whether the measure is
                 impacted by the anomaly group  (EFFECT_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP
                 ).

              ContributionPercentage -> (double)
                 For  potential  causes  (CAUSE_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP  ), the
                 percentage contribution the measure has in causing the  anom-
                 alies.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination token that's included if more results are available.
