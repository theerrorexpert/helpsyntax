LIST-METRIC-SETS()                                          LIST-METRIC-SETS()



NAME
       list-metric-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the datasets in the current AWS Region.

       Amazon  Lookout  for  Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If
       you do a read operation on a resource  immediately  after  creating  or
       modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to com-
       plete.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-metric-sets
          [--anomaly-detector-arn <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --anomaly-detector-arn (string)
          The ARN of the anomaly detector containing the metrics sets to list.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  result  of the previous request was truncated, the response
          includes a NextToken . To retrieve the next set of results, use  the
          token in the next request. Tokens expire after 24 hours.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MetricSetSummaryList -> (list)
          A list of the datasets in the AWS Region, with configuration details
          for each.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a dataset.

              MetricSetArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the dataset.

              AnomalyDetectorArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the detector to which the dataset belongs.

              MetricSetDescription -> (string)
                 The description of the dataset.

              MetricSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the dataset.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the dataset was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the dataset was last modified.

              Tags -> (map)
                 The dataset's tags .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, the list call returns this  token.  To
          retrieve  the  next  set  of results, use the token in the next list
          request.
