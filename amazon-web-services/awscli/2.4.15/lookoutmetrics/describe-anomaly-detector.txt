NAME
       describe-anomaly-detector -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a detector.

       Amazon  Lookout  for  Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If
       you do a read operation on a resource  immediately  after  creating  or
       modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to com-
       plete.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-anomaly-detector
          --anomaly-detector-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --anomaly-detector-arn (string)
          The ARN of the detector to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AnomalyDetectorArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the detector.

       AnomalyDetectorName -> (string)
          The name of the detector.

       AnomalyDetectorDescription -> (string)
          A description of the detector.

       AnomalyDetectorConfig -> (structure)
          Contains information about the detector's configuration.

          AnomalyDetectorFrequency -> (string)
              The interval at which the detector analyzes its source data.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the detector was created.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the detector was last modified.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the detector.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          The reason that the detector failed.

       KmsKeyArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the KMS key to use to encrypt your data.

       FailureType -> (string)
          The process that caused the detector to fail.
