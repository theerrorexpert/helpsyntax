NAME
       describe-app-instance-user-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the full details of an AppInstanceUserEndpoint .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-app-instance-user-endpoint
          --app-instance-user-arn <value>
          --endpoint-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-instance-user-arn (string)
          The ARN of the AppInstanceUser .

       --endpoint-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the AppInstanceUserEndpoint .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AppInstanceUserEndpoint -> (structure)
          The   full  details  of  an  AppInstanceUserEndpoint  :  the  AppIn-
          stanceUserArn , ID, name, type, resource ARN, attributes, allow mes-
          sages,  state,  and  created  and last updated timestamps. All time-
          stamps use epoch milliseconds.

          AppInstanceUserArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the AppInstanceUser .

          EndpointId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the AppInstanceUserEndpoint .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the AppInstanceUserEndpoint .

          Type -> (string)
              The type of the AppInstanceUserEndpoint .

          ResourceArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource to which the endpoint belongs.

          EndpointAttributes -> (structure)
              The attributes of an Endpoint .

              DeviceToken -> (string)
                 The device token for the GCM, APNS, and APNS_SANDBOX endpoint
                 types.

              VoipDeviceToken -> (string)
                 The  VOIP device token for the APNS and APNS_SANDBOX endpoint
                 types.

          CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which an AppInstanceUserEndpoint was created.

          LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which an AppInstanceUserEndpoint was last updated.

          AllowMessages -> (string)
              Boolean that controls  whether  the  AppInstanceUserEndpoint  is
              opted  in  to  receive messages. ALL indicates the endpoint will
              receive all messages. NONE indicates the endpoint  will  receive
              no messages.

          EndpointState -> (structure)
              A  read-only  field  that  represents  the  state  of  an AppIn-
              stanceUserEndpoint . Supported values:

              o ACTIVE : The AppInstanceUserEndpoint is  active  and  able  to
                receive  messages.  When  ACTIVE  ,  the  EndpointStatusReason
                remains empty.

              o INACTIVE : The AppInstanceUserEndpoint is inactive  and  can't
                receive message. When INACTIVE , the corresponding reason will
                be conveyed through EndpointStatusReason .

              o INVALID_DEVICE_TOKEN indicates that an AppInstanceUserEndpoint
                is INACTIVE due to invalid device token

              o INVALID_PINPOINT_ARN indicates that an AppInstanceUserEndpoint
                is INACTIVE due to an invalid  pinpoint  ARN  that  was  input
                through the ResourceArn field.

              Status -> (string)
                 Enum  that indicates the Status of an AppInstanceUserEndpoint
                 .

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the EndpointStatus .
