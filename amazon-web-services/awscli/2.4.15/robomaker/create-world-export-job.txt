          --worlds <value>
          --output-location <value>

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --worlds (list)
          A list of Amazon Resource Names (arns) that correspond to worlds  to
          export.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --output-location (structure)
          The output location.

          s3Bucket -> (string)
              The S3 bucket for output.

          s3Prefix -> (string)
              The S3 folder in the s3Bucket where output files will be placed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3Bucket=string,s3Prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3Bucket": "string",
            "s3Prefix": "string"
          }

       --iam-role (string)
          The IAM role that the world export process uses to access the Amazon
          S3 bucket and put the export.

       --tags (map)
          A map that contains tag keys and tag values that are attached to the
          world export job.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
