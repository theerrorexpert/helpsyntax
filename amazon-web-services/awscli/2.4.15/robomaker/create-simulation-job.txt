                        A  prefix  that specifies where files will be uploaded
                        in Amazon S3. It is appended to the simulation  output
                        location to determine the final path.

                        For  example,  if  your  simulation output location is
                        s3://my-bucket and your upload configuration  name  is

                     path -> (string)
                        Specifies the path of the file(s) to upload.  Standard
                        Unix  glob matching rules are accepted, with the addi-
                        tion of ** as a super asterisk . For example, specify-
                        ing  /var/log/**.log  causes  all  .log  files  in the
                        /var/log directory tree  to  be  collected.  For  more
                        examples, see Glob Library .

                     uploadBehavior -> (string)
                        Specifies when to upload the files:
                            UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

                        Matching files are uploaded once the simulation enters
                        the TERMINATING state. Matching files are not uploaded
                        until all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

                        If there is a problem uploading a file, the upload  is
                        retried.   If  problems  persist,  no  further  upload
                        attempts will be made.
                            UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                        Matching files are uploaded as they are created.  They
                        are  deleted  after  they  are uploaded. The specified
                        path is checked every 5 seconds. A final check is made
                        when  all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

              useDefaultUploadConfigurations -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean indicating whether to use default upload configura-
                 tions.  By  default, .ros and .gazebo files are uploaded when
                 the  application  terminates  and  all  ROS  topics  will  be
                 recorded.

                 If you set this value, you must specify an outputLocation .

              tools -> (list)

                     job.

                     streamUI -> (boolean)
                        Boolean indicating whether a streaming session will be
                        configured for the tool. If True , AWS RoboMaker  will
                        configure  a  connection  so you can interact with the
                        tool as it is running in the simulation. It must  have
                        a graphical user interface. The default is False .

                     exitBehavior -> (string)
                        Exit  behavior  determines what happens when your tool
                        quits running. RESTART will  cause  your  tool  to  be
                        restarted.  FAIL  will  cause  your  job  to exit. The
                        default is RESTART .

              useDefaultTools -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean indicating whether to use default robot application
                 tools.  The  default tools are rviz, rqt, terminal and rosbag

                        the TERMINATING state. Matching files are not uploaded
                        until all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

                        If  there is a problem uploading a file, the upload is
                        retried.  If  problems  persist,  no  further   upload
                        attempts will be made.
                            UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                        Matching  files are uploaded as they are created. They
                        are deleted after they  are  uploaded.  The  specified
                        path is checked every 5 seconds. A final check is made
                        when all of your code (including tools) have  stopped.

              useDefaultUploadConfigurations -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean indicating whether to use default upload configura-
                 tions. By default, .ros and .gazebo files are  uploaded  when
                 the  application  terminates  and  all  ROS  topics  will  be
                 recorded.

                 If you set this value, you must specify an outputLocation .

                     exitBehavior -> (string)
                        Exit behavior determines what happens when  your  tool
                        quits  running.  RESTART  will  cause  your tool to be
                        restarted. FAIL will  cause  your  job  to  exit.  The
                        default is RESTART .

              useDefaultTools -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean indicating whether to use default simulation appli-
                 cation tools. The default tools are rviz, rqt,  terminal  and

       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

              A list of subnet IDs associated with the simulation job.

              (string)

          securityGroups -> (list)
              A list of security group IDs associated with the simulation job.

              (string)

          vpcId -> (string)
              The VPC ID associated with your simulation job.

          assignPublicIp -> (boolean)
              A boolean indicating if a public IP was assigned.

       compute -> (structure)
          Compute information for the simulation job.

          simulationUnitLimit -> (integer)
              The simulation unit limit. Your simulation is allocated CPU  and
              memory  proportional  to  the  supplied simulation unit limit. A
              simulation unit is 1 vcpu and 2GB of memory. You are only billed
              for  the SU utilization you consume up to the maximum value pro-
              vided. The default is 15.

          computeType -> (string)
              Compute type response information for the simulation job.

          gpuUnitLimit -> (integer)
              Compute GPU unit limit for the simulation job. It is the same as
              the number of GPUs allocated to the SimulationJob.
