BATCH-DESCRIBE-SIMULATION-JOB()                BATCH-DESCRIBE-SIMULATION-JOB()



NAME
       batch-describe-simulation-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more simulation jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-describe-simulation-job
          --jobs <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --jobs (list)
          A  list  of  Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  of  simulation jobs to
          describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                               uploaded  in  Amazon  S3. It is appended to the
                               simulation output  location  to  determine  the
                               final path.

                               For example, if your simulation output location
                               is s3://my-bucket and your upload configuration

                               Matching files are uploaded once the simulation
                               enters the TERMINATING  state.  Matching  files
                               are   not  uploaded  until  all  of  your  code
                               (including tools) have stopped.

                               If there is a problem  uploading  a  file,  the
                               upload is retried. If problems persist, no fur-
                               ther upload attempts will be made.
                                   UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                               Matching files are uploaded as  they  are  cre-
                               ated. They are deleted after they are uploaded.
                               The specified path is checked every 5  seconds.
                               A  final  check  is  made when all of your code
                               (including tools) have stopped.

                               If  there  is  a  problem uploading a file, the
                               upload is retried. If problems persist, no fur-
                               ther upload attempts will be made.
                                   UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                               Matching  files  are  uploaded as they are cre-
                               ated. They are deleted after they are uploaded.
                               The  specified path is checked every 5 seconds.
                               A final check is made when  all  of  your  code
                               (including tools) have stopped.

                        A  Boolean  indicating  whether  to use default upload
                        configurations. By default, .ros and .gazebo files are
                        uploaded  when  the application terminates and all ROS
                        topics will be recorded.

                               will be configured for the tool. If True ,  AWS
                               RoboMaker  will  configure  a connection so you
                               can interact with the tool as it is running  in
                               the  simulation.  It must have a graphical user
