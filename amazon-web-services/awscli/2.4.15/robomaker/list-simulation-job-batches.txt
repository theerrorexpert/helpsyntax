LIST-SIMULATION-JOB-BATCHES()                    LIST-SIMULATION-JOB-BATCHES()



NAME
       list-simulation-job-batches -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list simulation job batches. You can optionally provide fil-
       ters to retrieve specific simulation batch jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-simulation-job-batches is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: simulationJobBatchSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-simulation-job-batches
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Optional filters to limit results.

          (structure)
              Information about a filter.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 A list of values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       simulationJobBatchSummaries -> (list)
          A list of simulation job batch summaries.

          (structure)
              Information about a simulation job batch.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the batch.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when  the  simula-
                 tion job batch was last updated.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the simula-
                 tion job batch was created.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the simulation job batch.
                     Pending

                 The simulation job batch request is pending.
                     InProgress

                 The simulation job batch is in progress.
                     Failed

                 The simulation job batch failed. One or more  simulation  job
                 requests  could  not  be completed due to an internal failure
                 (like InternalServiceError ). See failureCode and failureRea-
                 son for more information.
                     Completed

                 The  simulation batch job completed. A batch is complete when
                 (1) there are no pending simulation job requests in the batch
                 and  none  of  the  failed simulation job requests are due to
                 InternalServiceError and (2) when all created simulation jobs
                 have  reached  a  terminal  state  (for example, Completed or
                 Failed ).
                     Canceled

                 The simulation batch job was cancelled.
                     Canceling

                 The simulation batch job is being cancelled.
                     Completing

                 The simulation batch job is completing.
                     TimingOut

                 The simulation job batch is timing out.

                 If a batch timing out, and there are  pending  requests  that
                 were  failing  due  to an internal failure (like InternalSer-
                 viceError ), the batch status will be Failed . If  there  are
                 no  such failing request, the batch status will be TimedOut .
                     TimedOut

                 The simulation batch job timed out.

              failedRequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of failed simulation job requests.

              pendingRequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of pending simulation job requests.

              createdRequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of created simulation job requests.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the previous paginated request did not return all of the  remain-
          ing  results, the response object's nextToken parameter value is set
          to a token. To retrieve the next set of  results,  call  ListSimula-
          tionJobBatches  again  and assign that token to the request object's
          nextToken parameter. If there are no remaining results, the previous
          response object's NextToken parameter is set to null.
