DESCRIBE-STREAM()                                            DESCRIBE-STREAM()



NAME
       describe-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a stream, including the current status of the
       stream, its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the composition of its  shards,
       and its corresponding DynamoDB table.

       NOTE:
          You  can  call DescribeStream at a maximum rate of 10 times per sec-
          ond.

       Each shard in the stream has a SequenceNumberRange associated with  it.
       If  the  SequenceNumberRange  has  a StartingSequenceNumber but no End-
       ingSequenceNumber , then the shard is still open (able to receive  more
       stream  records). If both StartingSequenceNumber and EndingSequenceNum-
       ber are present, then that shard is closed and can  no  longer  receive
       more data.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stream
          --stream-arn <value>
          [--limit <value>]
          [--exclusive-start-shard-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream.

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of shard objects to return. The upper limit is
          100.

       --exclusive-start-shard-id (string)
          The shard ID of the first item that this  operation  will  evaluate.
          Use the value that was returned for LastEvaluatedShardId in the pre-
          vious operation.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a DynamoDB stream

       The following describe-stream command displays  information  about  the
       specific DynamoDB stream.

          aws dynamodbstreams describe-stream \
              --stream-arn arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-1:123456789012:table/Music/stream/2019-10-22T18:02:01.576

OUTPUT
       StreamDescription -> (structure)
          A complete description of the stream, including  its  creation  date
          and  time,  the DynamoDB table associated with the stream, the shard
          IDs within the stream, and the beginning and ending sequence numbers
          of stream records within the shards.

          StreamArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream.

          StreamLabel -> (string)
              A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream.

              Note  that  LatestStreamLabel is not a unique identifier for the
              stream, because it is possible that a stream from another  table
              might  have  the same timestamp. However, the combination of the
              following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:

              o the AWS customer ID.

              o the table name

              o the StreamLabel

          StreamStatus -> (string)
              Indicates the current status of the stream:

              o ENABLING - Streams is currently being enabled on the  DynamoDB
                table.

              o ENABLED - the stream is enabled.

              o DISABLING  -  Streams  is  currently  being  disabled  on  the
                DynamoDB table.

              o DISABLED - the stream is disabled.

          StreamViewType -> (string)
              Indicates the format of the records within this stream:

              o KEYS_ONLY - only the key attributes of items that  were  modi-
                fied in the DynamoDB table.

              o NEW_IMAGE  -  entire  items  from  the table, as they appeared
                after they were modified.

              o OLD_IMAGE - entire items from  the  table,  as  they  appeared
                before they were modified.

              o NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES  -  both  the new and the old images of the
                items from the table.

          CreationRequestDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the request to  create  this  stream  was
              issued.

          TableName -> (string)
              The DynamoDB table with which the stream is associated.

          KeySchema -> (list)
              The key attribute(s) of the stream's DynamoDB table.

              (structure)
                 Represents  a  single  element  of a key schema. A key schema
                 specifies the attributes that make up the primary  key  of  a
                 table, or the key attributes of an index.

                 A  KeySchemaElement  represents  exactly one attribute of the
                 primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be  rep-
                 resented  by  one KeySchemaElement (for the partition key). A
                 composite primary key would require one KeySchemaElement  for
                 the  partition key, and another KeySchemaElement for the sort
                 key.

                 A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not
                 a  nested  attribute).  The  data type must be one of String,
                 Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be  nested  within  a
                 List or a Map.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of a key attribute.

                 KeyType -> (string)
                     The role that this key attribute will assume:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term  "hash  attribute"  derives  from
                        DynamoDB's  usage  of  an  internal  hash  function to
                        evenly distribute data items across partitions,  based
                        on their partition key values.

                        The  sort  key  of  an item is also known as its range
                        attribute . The term "range  attribute"  derives  from
                        the  way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition
                        key physically close together, in sorted order by  the
                        sort key value.

          Shards -> (list)
              The shards that comprise the stream.

              (structure)
                 A  uniquely  identified  group  of  stream  records  within a
                 stream.

                 ShardId -> (string)
                     The system-generated identifier for this shard.

                 SequenceNumberRange -> (structure)
                     The range of possible sequence numbers for the shard.

                     StartingSequenceNumber -> (string)
                        The first sequence number for the stream records  con-
                        tained within a shard. String contains numeric charac-
                        ters only.

                     EndingSequenceNumber -> (string)
                        The last sequence number for the stream  records  con-
                        tained within a shard. String contains numeric charac-
                        ters only.

                 ParentShardId -> (string)
                     The shard ID of the current shard's parent.

          LastEvaluatedShardId -> (string)
              The shard ID of the item where the operation stopped,  inclusive
              of the previous result set. Use this value to start a new opera-
              tion, excluding this value in the new request.

              If LastEvaluatedShardId  is  empty,  then  the  "last  page"  of
              results  has  been processed and there is currently no more data
              to be retrieved.

              If LastEvaluatedShardId is not empty, it  does  not  necessarily
              mean  that there is more data in the result set. The only way to
              know when you have reached the end of the  result  set  is  when
              LastEvaluatedShardId is empty.
