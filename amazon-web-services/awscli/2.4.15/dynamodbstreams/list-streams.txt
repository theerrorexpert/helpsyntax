LIST-STREAMS()                                                  LIST-STREAMS()



NAME
       list-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of stream ARNs associated with the current account and
       endpoint. If the TableName parameter is present, then ListStreams  will
       return only the streams ARNs for that table.

       NOTE:
          You can call ListStreams at a maximum rate of 5 times per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-streams
          [--table-name <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--exclusive-start-stream-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          If this parameter is provided, then only the streams associated with
          this table name are returned.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of streams to return. The upper limit is 100.

       --exclusive-start-stream-arn (string)
          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the first item that this operation
          will  evaluate.  Use  the value that was returned for LastEvaluated-
          StreamArn in the previous operation.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list DynamoDB streams

       The following list-streams command lists all existing  Amazon  DynamoDB
       streams within the default AWS Region.

          aws dynamodbstreams list-streams

       Output:

          {
              "Streams": [
                  {
                      "StreamArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-1:123456789012:table/Music/stream/2019-10-22T18:02:01.576",
                      "TableName": "Music",
                      "StreamLabel": "2019-10-22T18:02:01.576"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Streams in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Streams -> (list)
          A list of stream descriptors associated with the current account and
          endpoint.

          (structure)
              Represents all of the data describing a particular stream.

              StreamArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream.

              TableName -> (string)
                 The DynamoDB table with which the stream is associated.

              StreamLabel -> (string)
                 A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream.

                 Note  that  LatestStreamLabel  is not a unique identifier for
                 the stream, because it is possible that a stream from another
                 table might have the same timestamp. However, the combination
                 of the following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:

                 o the AWS customer ID.

                 o the table name

                 o the StreamLabel

       LastEvaluatedStreamArn -> (string)
          The stream ARN of the item where the operation stopped, inclusive of
          the  previous  result  set. Use this value to start a new operation,
          excluding this value in the new request.

          If LastEvaluatedStreamArn is empty, then the "last page" of  results
          has been processed and there is no more data to be retrieved.

          If LastEvaluatedStreamArn is not empty, it does not necessarily mean
          that there is more data in the result set. The only way to know when
          you  have  reached  the end of the result set is when LastEvaluated-
          StreamArn is empty.
