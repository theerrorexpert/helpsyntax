          o ENABLED  - Anything specified in this assignment is used when cre-
            ating the data source.

          o DISABLED - This assignment  isn't  used  when  creating  the  data
            source.

          o DRAFT - This assignment is an unfinished draft and isn't used when
            creating the data source.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DRAFT

          o DISABLED

       --policy-arn (string)
          The ARN for the IAM policy to apply to the Amazon  QuickSight  users
          and groups specified in this assignment.

          the policy to.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
