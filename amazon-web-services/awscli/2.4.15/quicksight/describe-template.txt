DESCRIPTION
       Describes a template's metadata.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-template
          --aws-account-id <value>
          --template-id <value>
          [--version-number <value>]
          [--alias-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that contains the template
          that you're describing.

       --template-id (string)
          The ID for the template.

       --version-number (long)
          (Optional) The number for the version to describe. If a  VersionNum-
          ber  parameter  value isn't provided, the latest version of the tem-
          plate is described.

       --alias-name (string)
          The alias of the template that you want to describe. If you  name  a
          specific  alias,  you describe the version that the alias points to.
          You can specify the latest version of the template by providing  the
          keyword  $LATEST  in the AliasName parameter. The keyword $PUBLISHED
          doesn't apply to templates.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
