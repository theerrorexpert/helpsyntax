                 o The ARN of an Amazon Web Services account root: This is  an
                   IAM  ARN rather than a QuickSight ARN. Use this option only
                   to share resources (templates) across Amazon  Web  Services
                   accounts. (This is less common.)

              Actions -> (list)
                 The IAM action to grant or revoke permissions on.

                 (string)

       JSON Syntax:

            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          A  map  of the key-value pairs for the resource tag or tags that you
          want to add to the resource.

          (structure)
              The key or keys of the key-value pairs for the resource  tag  or
              tags assigned to the resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 Tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            }

          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
