NAME
       generate-embed-url-for-anonymous-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  an  embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight
       dashboard in your website, without having to register any reader users.
       Before  you  use  this  action,  make sure that you have configured the
       dashboards and permissions.

       The following rules apply to the generated URL:

       o It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after
         it  is  generated.  Once  redeemed  within  this period, it cannot be
         re-used again.

       o The URL validity period should not be confused with the  actual  ses-
         sion    lifetime    that    can    be   customized   using   the   ``
         SessionLifetimeInMinutes `` parameter. The resulting user session  is
         valid for 15 minutes (default) to 10 hours (maximum).

       o You  are  charged  only  when the URL is used or there is interaction
         with Amazon QuickSight.

       For more information, see Embedded Analytics in the  Amazon  QuickSight
       User Guide .

       For  more  information about the high-level steps for embedding and for
       an interactive demo of the ways you can customize embedding, visit  the

SYNOPSIS
            generate-embed-url-for-anonymous-user
          --aws-account-id <value>
          [--session-lifetime-in-minutes <value>]
          --namespace <value>
          [--session-tags <value>]
          --authorized-resource-arns <value>
          --experience-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  for the Amazon Web Services account that contains the dash-
          board that you're embedding.

       --session-lifetime-in-minutes (long)
          How many minutes the session is valid. The session lifetime must  be
          in [15-600] minutes range.

       --namespace (string)
          The  Amazon  QuickSight  namespace that the anonymous user virtually
          belongs to. If you are not using an Amazon QuickSight custom  names-
          pace, set this to default .

       --session-tags (list)
          The  session  tags  used for row-level security. Before you use this
          parameter, make sure that you have configured the relevant  datasets
          using  the  DataSet$RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration  parameter so
          that session tags can be used to provide row-level security.

          These are not the tags used for the  Amazon  Web  Services  resource
          tagging  feature. For more information, see Using Row-Level Security
          (RLS) with Tags .

          (structure)
              The key-value pair used for the row-level security tags feature.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value that you want to assign the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --authorized-resource-arns (list)
          The  Amazon  Resource Names for the Amazon QuickSight resources that
          the user is authorized to access during the lifetime of the session.
          If you choose Dashboard embedding experience, pass the list of dash-
          board ARNs in the account that you want the user to be able to view.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --experience-configuration (structure)
          The configuration of the experience you are embedding.

          Dashboard -> (structure)
              The  type  of  embedding experience. In this case, Amazon Quick-
              Sight dashboards.

              InitialDashboardId -> (string)
                 The dashboard ID for the dashboard that you want the user  to
                 see  first.  This  ID is included in the output URL. When the
                 URL in response is accessed, Amazon QuickSight  renders  this
                 dashboard.

                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of this dashboard must be
                 included in the AuthorizedResourceArns parameter.  Otherwise,
                 the request will fail with InvalidParameterValueException .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Dashboard={InitialDashboardId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Dashboard": {
              "InitialDashboardId": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EmbedUrl -> (string)
          The embed URL for the dashboard.

       Status -> (integer)
          The HTTP status of the request.

       RequestId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services request ID for this operation.
