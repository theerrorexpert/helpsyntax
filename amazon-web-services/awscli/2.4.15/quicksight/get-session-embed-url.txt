GET-SESSION-EMBED-URL()                                GET-SESSION-EMBED-URL()



NAME
       get-session-embed-url -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a  session  URL  and  authorization code that you can use to
       embed the Amazon Amazon QuickSight console in your web server code. Use
       GetSessionEmbedUrl  where  you want to provide an authoring portal that
       allows users to create data  sources,  datasets,  analyses,  and  dash-
       boards. The users who access an embedded Amazon QuickSight console need
       belong to the author or admin security cohort. If you want to  restrict
       permissions to some of these features, add a custom permissions profile
       to  the  user  with  the  ``  UpdateUser  ``  API  operation.  Use   ``
       RegisterUser  ``  API operation to add a new user with a custom permis-
       sion profile attached. For more information, see the following sections
       in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide :

       o Embedding Analytics

       o Customizing Access to the Amazon QuickSight Console

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-session-embed-url
          --aws-account-id <value>
          [--entry-point <value>]
          [--session-lifetime-in-minutes <value>]
          [--user-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account associated with your Ama-
          zon QuickSight subscription.

       --entry-point (string)
          The URL you use to access the embedded session. The entry point  URL
          is constrained to the following paths:

          o /start

          o /start/analyses

          o /start/dashboards

          o /start/favorites

          o /dashboards/*DashboardId*  ``  - where ``DashboardId is the actual
            ID key from the Amazon QuickSight console URL of the dashboard

          o /analyses/*AnalysisId* `` - where ``AnalysisId is  the  actual  ID
            key from the Amazon QuickSight console URL of the analysis

       --session-lifetime-in-minutes (long)
          How  many minutes the session is valid. The session lifetime must be
          15-600 minutes.

       --user-arn (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight user's Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN),  for  use
          with QUICKSIGHT identity type. You can use this for any type of Ama-
          zon QuickSight users in your account (readers, authors, or  admins).
          They need to be authenticated as one of the following:

          o Active Directory (AD) users or group members

          o Invited nonfederated users

          o Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and IAM role-based ses-
            sions authenticated through Federated Single Sign-On  using  SAML,
            OpenID Connect, or IAM federation

          Omit  this parameter for users in the third group, IAM users and IAM
          role-based sessions.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EmbedUrl -> (string)
          A single-use URL that you can put into your server-side web page  to
          embed  your  Amazon QuickSight session. This URL is valid for 5 min-
          utes. The API operation provides the URL  with  an  auth_code  value
          that  enables  one  (and only one) sign-on to a user session that is
          valid for 10 hours.

       Status -> (integer)
          The HTTP status of the request.

       RequestId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services request ID for this operation.
