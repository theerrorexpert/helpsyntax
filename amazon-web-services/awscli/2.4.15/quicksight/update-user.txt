OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight user name that you want to update.

       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that the user is in. Cur-
          rently, you use the ID for the Amazon Web Services account that con-
          tains your Amazon QuickSight account.

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace. Currently, you should set this to default .

       --email (string)
          The email address of the user that you want to update.

       --role (string)
          The  Amazon  QuickSight role of the user. The role can be one of the
          following default security cohorts:

          o READER : A user who has read-only access to dashboards.

          o AUTHOR : A user who can create data sources,  datasets,  analyses,
            and dashboards.

          o ADMIN : A user who is an author, who can also manage Amazon Quick-
            Sight settings.

          The name of the Amazon QuickSight role  is  invisible  to  the  user
          except for the console screens dealing with permissions.

          Possible values:

          o ADMIN

          o AUTHOR

          o READER

          o RESTRICTED_AUTHOR

          o RESTRICTED_READER

       --custom-permissions-name (string)
          (Enterprise edition only) The name of the custom permissions profile
          that you want to assign to this user. Customized permissions  allows
          you  to  control a user's access by restricting access the following
          operations:

          o Create and update data sources

          o Create and update datasets

          o Create and update email reports

          o Subscribe to email reports

          A set of  custom  permissions  includes  any  combination  of  these
          restrictions.  Currently,  you  need to create the profile names for
          custom permission sets by using the Amazon QuickSight console. Then,
          you  use  the  RegisterUser API operation to assign the named set of
          permissions to a QuickSight user.

          Amazon QuickSight custom permissions are applied through  IAM  poli-
          cies.  Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted by
          assigning Amazon QuickSight users to one  of  the  default  security
          cohorts in Amazon QuickSight (admin, author, reader).

          This  feature is available only to Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edi-
          tion subscriptions.

       --unapply-custom-permissions     |      --no-unapply-custom-permissions
       (boolean)
          A  flag  that you use to indicate that you want to remove all custom
          permissions from this user. Using this parameter resets the user  to
          the state it was in before a custom permissions profile was applied.
          This parameter defaults to NULL and  it  doesn't  accept  any  other
          value.

       --external-login-federation-provider-type (string)
          The type of supported external login provider that provides identity
          to let a user federate into Amazon  QuickSight  with  an  associated
          Identity  and  Access  Management(IAM)  role.  The type of supported
          external login provider can be one of the following.

          o COGNITO :  Amazon  Cognito.  The  provider  URL  is  cognito-iden-
            tity.amazonaws.com.  When choosing the COGNITO provider type, dont
            use the  "CustomFederationProviderUrl"  parameter  which  is  only
            needed when the external provider is custom.

          o CUSTOM_OIDC : Custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. When choosing
            CUSTOM_OIDC type, use the CustomFederationProviderUrl parameter to
            provide the custom OIDC provider URL.

          o NONE  : This clears all the previously saved external login infor-
            mation for a user. Use the `` DescribeUser  ``  API  operation  to
            check the external login information.

       --custom-federation-provider-url (string)
          The  URL  of the custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that provides
          identity to let a user federate into Amazon QuickSight with an asso-
          ciated  Identity  and  Access  Management(IAM)  role. This parameter
          should only be used when ExternalLoginFederationProviderType parame-
          ter is set to CUSTOM_OIDC .

       --external-login-id (string)
          The identity ID for a user in the external login provider.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
