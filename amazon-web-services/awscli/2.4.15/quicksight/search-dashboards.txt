SEARCH-DASHBOARDS()                                        SEARCH-DASHBOARDS()



NAME
       search-dashboards -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for dashboards that belong to a user.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-dashboards is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DashboardSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            search-dashboards
          --aws-account-id <value>
          --filters <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  Amazon Web Services account that contains the user
          whose dashboards you're searching for.

       --filters (list)
          The filters to apply to the search. Currently, you can  search  only
          by user name, for example, "Filters": [ { "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER",
          "Operator":      "StringEquals",      "Value":       "arn:aws:quick-
          sight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1" } ]

          (structure)
              A filter that you apply when searching for dashboards.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The comparison operator that you want to use as a filter, for
                 example, "Operator": "StringEquals" .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the value that you want to use as a  filter,  for
                 example, "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER" .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the named item, in this case QUICKSIGHT_USER ,
                 that you want to use  as  a  filter,  for  example,  "Value":
                 "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operator=string,Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Operator": "StringEquals",
              "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
