DELETE-ANALYSIS()                                            DELETE-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       delete-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include
       a recovery window during which you can restore  the  analysis.  If  you
       don't  specify  a  recovery  window value, the operation defaults to 30
       days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a DeletionTime stamp to  the  response
       that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recov-
       ery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.

       At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the  RestoreAnaly-
       sis API operation to remove the DeletionTime stamp and cancel the dele-
       tion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible  in  the  API  until
       it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from
       it.

       An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the  Ama-
       zon QuickSight console. To access it in the console, restore it. Delet-
       ing an analysis doesn't delete the dashboards that you publish from it.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-analysis
          --aws-account-id <value>
          --analysis-id <value>
          [--recovery-window-in-days <value>]
          [--force-delete-without-recovery | --no-force-delete-without-recovery]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services account where you want to delete
          an analysis.

       --analysis-id (string)
          The ID of the analysis that you're deleting.

       --recovery-window-in-days (long)
          A value that specifies the number of  days  that  Amazon  QuickSight
          waits  before  it deletes the analysis. You can't use this parameter
          with the ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery option in the same API call. The
          default value is 30.

       --force-delete-without-recovery   |  --no-force-delete-without-recovery
       (boolean)
          This option defaults to the value NoForceDeleteWithoutRecovery .  To
          immediately  delete the analysis, add the ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery
          option. You can't restore an analysis after it's deleted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (integer)
          The HTTP status of the request.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the deleted analysis.

       AnalysisId -> (string)
          The ID of the deleted analysis.

       DeletionTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the analysis is scheduled to be deleted.

       RequestId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services request ID for this operation.
