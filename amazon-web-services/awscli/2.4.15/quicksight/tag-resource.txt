TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  one  or  more  tags  (key-value pairs) to the specified Amazon
       QuickSight resource.

       Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can  also
       use  them  to  scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to
       access or change only resources with certain tag values.  You  can  use
       the TagResource operation with a resource that already has tags. If you
       specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag  is  appended  to  the
       list  of  tags  associated  with the resource. If you specify a tag key
       that is already associated with the resource, the new  tag  value  that
       you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

       You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. Amazon QuickSight
       supports tagging on data set, data source, dashboard, and template.

       Tagging for Amazon QuickSight works in a similar  way  to  tagging  for
       other Amazon Web Services services, except for the following:

       o You  can't  use tags to track costs for Amazon QuickSight. This isn't
         possible because you can't tag the resources that  Amazon  QuickSight
         costs  are  based  on, for example Amazon QuickSight storage capacity
         (SPICE), number of users, type of users, and usage metrics.

       o Amazon QuickSight  doesn't  currently  support  the  tag  editor  for
         Resource Groups.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you want to tag.

       --tags (list)
          Contains a map of the key-value pairs for the resource tag  or  tags
          assigned to the resource.

          (structure)
              The  key  or keys of the key-value pairs for the resource tag or
              tags assigned to the resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 Tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RequestId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services request ID for this operation.

       Status -> (integer)
          The HTTP status of the request.
