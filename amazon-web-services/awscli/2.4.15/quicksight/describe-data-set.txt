NAME
       describe-data-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  dataset.  This  operation  doesn't  support datasets that
       include uploaded files as a source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-data-set
          --aws-account-id <value>
          --data-set-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID.

       --data-set-id (string)
          The ID for the dataset that you want to create. This  ID  is  unique
          per Amazon Web Services Region for each Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 A logical table is a unit that joins and that data  transfor-
                 mations  operate  on. A logical table has a source, which can
                 be either a physical table or result of a join. When a  logi-
                 cal  table points to a physical table, the logical table acts
                 as a mutable copy of that physical  table  through  transform
                 operations.

                 Alias -> (string)
                     A display name for the logical table.

                        A  data  transformation  on a logical table. This is a
                        variant type  structure.  For  this  structure  to  be
                        valid, only one of the attributes can be non-null.

                        ProjectOperation -> (structure)
                            An  operation  that  projects  columns. Operations
                            that come after a projection  can  only  refer  to
                            projected columns.

                            ProjectedColumns -> (list)

                            dition.

                               value.  Rows for which the expression evaluates
                               to true are kept in the dataset.

                        CreateColumnsOperation -> (structure)
                            An operation that creates calculated columns. Col-
                            umns  created in one such operation form a lexical
                            closure.

                            Columns -> (list)

                                      A unique ID  to  identify  a  calculated
                                      column.  During a dataset update, if the
                                      column ID of a calculated column matches
                                      that  of  an existing calculated column,
                                      Amazon QuickSight preserves the existing
                                      calculated column.

                        CastColumnTypeOperation -> (structure)
                            A transform operation that casts  a  column  to  a
                            different type.

                            ColumnName -> (string)

                               type, you can supply a string in a format  sup-
                               ported  by  Amazon  QuickSight  to  denote  the
                               source data format.

                        TagColumnOperation -> (structure)
                            An operation that tags a  column  with  additional
                            information.

                            ColumnName -> (string)

                                   TagColumnOperation `` structure. This is  a
                                   variant  type structure. For this structure
                                   to be valid, only one of the attributes can
