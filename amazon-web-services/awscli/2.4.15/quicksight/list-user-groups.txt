SYNOPSIS
            list-user-groups
          --user-name <value>
          --aws-account-id <value>
          --namespace <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight user name that you want to list group  member-
          ships for.

       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services account ID that the user is in. Currently,
          you use the ID for the Amazon Web  Services  account  that  contains
          your Amazon QuickSight account.

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace. Currently, you should set this to default .

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in a subsequent request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return from this request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
