NAME
       generate-embed-url-for-registered-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  an  embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight
       experience in your website. This action can be used  for  any  type  of
       user  registered  in  an Amazon QuickSight account. Before you use this
       action, make sure that you have configured the relevant  Amazon  Quick-
       Sight resource and permissions.

       The following rules apply to the generated URL:

       o It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after
         it is generated. Once redeemed  within  this  period,  it  cannot  be
         re-used again.

       o The  URL  validity period should not be confused with the actual ses-
         sion   lifetime   that   can   be    customized    using    the    ``
         SessionLifetimeInMinutes  `` parameter. The resulting user session is
         valid for 15 minutes (default) to 10 hours (maximum).

       o You are charged only when the URL is used  or  there  is  interaction
         with Amazon QuickSight.

       For  more  information, see Embedded Analytics in the Amazon QuickSight
       User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            generate-embed-url-for-registered-user
          --aws-account-id <value>
          [--session-lifetime-in-minutes <value>]
          --user-arn <value>
          --experience-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that contains  the  dash-
          board that you're embedding.

       --session-lifetime-in-minutes (long)
          How  many minutes the session is valid. The session lifetime must be
          in [15-600] minutes range.

       --user-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name for the registered user.

       --experience-configuration (structure)
          The experience you are embedding.  For  registered  users,  you  can
          embed  Amazon  QuickSight dashboards or the entire Amazon QuickSight
          console.

          Dashboard -> (structure)
              The configuration details for providing  a  dashboard  embedding
              experience.

              InitialDashboardId -> (string)
                 The  dashboard ID for the dashboard that you want the user to
                 see first. This ID is included in the output  URL.  When  the
                 URL  in  response is accessed, Amazon QuickSight renders this
                 dashboard if the user has permissions to view it.

                 If the user does not have permission to view this  dashboard,
                 they see a permissions error message.

          QuickSightConsole -> (structure)
              The  configuration  details for providing each Amazon QuickSight
              console embedding experience. This can be used along with custom
              permissions  to  restrict  access  to certain features. For more
              information, see Customizing Access  to  the  Amazon  QuickSight
              Console in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide .

              Use  ``  GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser  `` where you want to
              provide an authoring portal that allows  users  to  create  data
              sources,  datasets,  analyses,  and  dashboards.  The  users who
              accesses an embedded Amazon QuickSight console needs  to  belong
              to  the author or admin security cohort. If you want to restrict
              permissions to some of these features, add a custom  permissions
              profile to the user with the `` UpdateUser `` API operation. Use
              the `` RegisterUser `` API operation to add a new  user  with  a
              custom  permission  profile  attached. For more information, see
              the following sections in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide :

              o Embedding the Full Functionality of the Amazon QuickSight Con-
                sole for Authenticated Users

              o Customizing Access to the Amazon QuickSight Console

              and for an interactive demo of the ways you can customize embed-
              ding, visit the Amazon QuickSight Developer Portal .

              InitialPath -> (string)
                 The  initial URL path for the Amazon QuickSight console. Ini-
                 tialPath is required.

                 The entry point URL is constrained to the following paths:

                 o /start

                 o /start/analyses

                 o /start/dashboards

                 o /start/favorites

                 o /dashboards/DashboardId . DashboardId is the actual ID  key
                   from the Amazon QuickSight console URL of the dashboard.

                 o /analyses/AnalysisId . AnalysisId is the actual ID key from
                   the Amazon QuickSight console URL of the analysis.

          QSearchBar -> (structure)
              The configuration details for embedding the Q search bar.

              For more information about  embedding  the  Q  search  bar,  see
              Embedding Overview .

              InitialTopicId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  Q  topic that you want to make the starting
                 topic in the Q search bar. You can find a topic ID  by  navi-
                 gating  to  the Topics pane in the Amazon QuickSight applica-
                 tion and opening a topic. The ID is in the URL for the  topic
                 that you open.

                 If  you  don't specify an initial topic, a list of all shared
                 topics is shown in the Q  bar  for  your  readers.  When  you
                 select an initial topic, you can specify whether or not read-
                 ers are allowed to select other  topics  from  the  available
                 ones in the list.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Dashboard={InitialDashboardId=string},QuickSightConsole={InitialPath=string},QSearchBar={InitialTopicId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Dashboard": {
              "InitialDashboardId": "string"
            },
            "QuickSightConsole": {
              "InitialPath": "string"
            },
            "QSearchBar": {
              "InitialTopicId": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
