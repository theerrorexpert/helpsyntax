       --logical-table-map (map)
          Configures the combination and transformation of the data  from  the
          physical tables.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              A  logical  table is a unit that joins and that data transforma-
              tions operate on. A logical table has a  source,  which  can  be
              either  a physical table or result of a join. When a logical ta-
              ble points to a physical table, the  logical  table  acts  as  a
              mutable  copy  of  that  physical table through transform opera-
              tions.

              Alias -> (string)
                 A display name for the logical table.

                     ant  type structure. For this structure to be valid, only
                     one of the attributes can be non-null.

                     ProjectOperation -> (structure)
                        An operation that projects  columns.  Operations  that
                        come  after  a  projection can only refer to projected
                        columns.

                            true are kept in the dataset.

                     CreateColumnsOperation -> (structure)
                        An  operation that creates calculated columns. Columns
                        created in one such operation form a lexical  closure.

                        Columns -> (list)
                            Calculated columns to create.

                            (structure)

                                   umn. During a dataset update, if the column
                                   ID  of  a calculated column matches that of
                                   an  existing  calculated   column,   Amazon
                                   QuickSight  preserves  the  existing calcu-
                                   lated column.

                               Expression -> (string)
                                   An expression that defines  the  calculated
                                   column.

                            type,  you  can  supply  a string in a format sup-
                            ported by Amazon QuickSight to denote  the  source
                            data format.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the

       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
