CREATE-IAM-POLICY-ASSIGNMENT()                  CREATE-IAM-POLICY-ASSIGNMENT()



NAME
       create-iam-policy-assignment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an assignment with one specified IAM policy, identified by its
       Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This policy assignment is attached  to  the
       specified  groups  or  users of Amazon QuickSight. Assignment names are
       unique per Amazon Web Services account. To avoid overwriting  rules  in
       other namespaces, use assignment names that are unique.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

            ating the data source.

          o DISABLED - This assignment  isn't  used  when  creating  the  data
            source.

          o DRAFT - This assignment is an unfinished draft and isn't used when
            creating the data source.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DRAFT

          o DISABLED

       --policy-arn (string)
          The ARN for the IAM policy to apply to the Amazon  QuickSight  users
          and groups specified in this assignment.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace that contains the assignment.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
