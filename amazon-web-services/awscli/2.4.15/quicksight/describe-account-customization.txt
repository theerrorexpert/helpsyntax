NAME
       describe-account-customization -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  customizations  associated with the provided Amazon Web
       Services account and Amazon Amazon QuickSight namespace  in  an  Amazon
       Web Services Region. The Amazon QuickSight console evaluates which cus-
       tomizations to apply by running this API operation  with  the  Resolved
       flag included.

       To  determine what customizations display when you run this command, it
       can help to visualize the relationship of the entities involved.

       o Amazon Web Services account - The Amazon Web Services account  exists
         at  the  top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the
         Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web  Services  Services.  When
         you  subscribe  to  Amazon QuickSight, you choose one Amazon Web Ser-
         vices Region to use as your home Region. That's where your free SPICE
         capacity  is  located. You can use Amazon QuickSight in any supported
         Amazon Web Services Region.

       o Amazon Web Services Region - In each Amazon Web Services Region where
         you  sign  in  to  Amazon QuickSight at least once, Amazon QuickSight
         acts as a separate instance of the same service. If you have  a  user
         directory,  it  resides  in  us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Vir-
         ginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to Amazon  Quick-
         Sight  in any Amazon Web Services Region, unless they are constrained
         to a namespace.  To run the command in a different  Amazon  Web  Ser-
         vices  Region,  you  change your Region settings. If you're using the
         CLI, you can use one of the following options:

         o Use command line options .

         o Use named profiles .

         o Run aws configure  to  change  your  default  Amazon  Web  Services
           Region.  Use Enter to key the same settings for your keys. For more
           information, see Configuring the CLI .

       o Namespace - A QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users
         and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access
         assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups  must  also
         be  part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are com-
         pletely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces,  even  if
         they  are in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Ser-
         vices Region.

       o Applied customizations - Within an Amazon Web Services Region, a  set
         of  Amazon  QuickSight customizations can apply to an Amazon Web Ser-
         vices account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a  names-
         pace  override  settings  that  you  apply  to an Amazon Web Services
         account. All settings are isolated to a single  Amazon  Web  Services
         Region.  To  apply them in other Amazon Web Services Regions, run the
         CreateAccountCustomization command in each Amazon Web Services Region
         where you want to apply the same customizations.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account-customization
          --aws-account-id <value>
          [--namespace <value>]
          [--resolved | --no-resolved]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that you want to describe
          Amazon QuickSight customizations for.

       --namespace (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight namespace that you  want  to  describe  Amazon
          QuickSight customizations for.

       --resolved | --no-resolved (boolean)
          The Resolved flag works with the other parameters to determine which
          view of Amazon QuickSight customizations is returned.  You  can  add
          this  flag  to  your command to use the same view that Amazon Quick-
          Sight uses to identify which customizations to apply to the console.
          Omit  this flag, or set it to no-resolved , to reveal customizations
          that are configured at different levels.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
