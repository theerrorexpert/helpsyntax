NAME
       get-domain-detail -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns  detailed information about a specified domain
       that is associated with the current Amazon Web Services  account.  Con-
       tact information for the domain is also returned as part of the output.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-detail
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain that you want  to  get  detailed  information
          about.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          ICANN, the organization that maintains a central database of  domain
          names, has developed a set of domain name status codes that tell you
          the status of a variety of operations on a domain name, for example,
          registering  a  domain  name,  transferring a domain name to another
          registrar, renewing the registration for a domain name, and  so  on.
          All registrars use this same set of status codes.

          For a current list of domain name status codes and an explanation of
          what each code means, go to the ICANN website  and  search  for  epp
          status  codes . (Search on the ICANN website; web searches sometimes
          return an old version of the document.)
