       TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount .

       WARNING:
          You must cancel the transfer before the other  Amazon  Web  Services
          account          accepts          the         transfer         using
          AcceptDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount .

       Use either ListOperations or GetOperationDetail  to  determine  whether
       the  operation succeeded. GetOperationDetail provides additional infor-
       mation, for example, Domain Transfer from Aws Account 111122223333  has
       been cancelled .

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-domain-transfer-to-another-aws-account
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name of the domain for which you want to cancel the transfer to
          another Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The identifier that  TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount  returned  to
          track  the progress of the request. Because the transfer request was
          canceled, the value is no longer valid, and you can't use  GetOpera-
          tionDetail to query the operation status.
