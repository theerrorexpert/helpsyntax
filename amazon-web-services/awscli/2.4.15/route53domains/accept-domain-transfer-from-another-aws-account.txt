ACCEPT-DOMAIN-TRANSFER-FROM-AACCEPT-DOMAIN-TRANSFER-FROM-ANOTHER-AWS-ACCOUNT()



NAME
       accept-domain-transfer-from-another-aws-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Accepts  the  transfer  of  a  domain  from another Amazon Web Services
       account to the currentAmazon  Web  Services  account.  You  initiate  a
       transfer     between     Amazon    Web    Services    accounts    using
       TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount .

       If        you        use        the        CLI        command        at
       accept-domain-transfer-from-another-aws-account  ,  use  JSON format as
       input instead of text because otherwise CLI will throw  an  error  from
       domain transfer input that includes single quotes.

       Use  either  ListOperations  or GetOperationDetail to determine whether
       the operation succeeded. GetOperationDetail provides additional  infor-
       mation,  for example, Domain Transfer from Aws Account 111122223333 has
       been cancelled .

SYNOPSIS
            accept-domain-transfer-from-another-aws-account
          --domain-name <value>
          --password <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain that was specified when  another  Amazon  Web
          Services   account   submitted  a  TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount
          request.

       --password (string)
          The      password      that      was      returned      by       the
          TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          Identifier  for  tracking  the progress of the request. To query the
          operation status, use GetOperationDetail .
