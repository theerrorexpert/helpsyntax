ENABLE-DOMAIN-AUTO-RENEW()                          ENABLE-DOMAIN-AUTO-RENEW()



NAME
       enable-domain-auto-renew -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  configures  Amazon Route 53 to automatically renew the
       specified domain before the domain registration expires.  The  cost  of
       renewing your domain registration is billed to your Amazon Web Services
       account.

       The period during which you can renew a domain name varies by TLD.  For
       a  list  of  TLDs  and their renewal policies, see Domains That You Can
       Register with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide  .
       Route  53  requires that you renew before the end of the renewal period
       so we can complete processing before the deadline.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-domain-auto-renew
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain that you want  to  enable  automatic  renewal
          for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable automatic renewal of a domain

       The  following  enable-domain-auto-renew command configures Route 53 to
       automatically renew the domain example.com before registration for  the
       domain expires.

       This  command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains enable-domain-auto-renew \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       This command produces no  output.  To  confirm  that  the  setting  was
       changed,  you  can  run  get-domain-detail  .  If  automatic renewal is
       enabled, the value of AutoRenew is True.

       For more information about automatic renewal, see
       `Renewing Registration for a Domain <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-renew.html`__
