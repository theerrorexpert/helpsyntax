DISABLE-DOMAIN-TRANSFER-LOCK()                  DISABLE-DOMAIN-TRANSFER-LOCK()



NAME
       disable-domain-transfer-lock -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  removes  the transfer lock on the domain (specifically
       the clientTransferProhibited status) to allow domain transfers. We rec-
       ommend  you  refrain  from  performing this action unless you intend to
       transfer the domain to a  different  registrar.  Successful  submission
       returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and com-
       pletion of the action. If the request is  not  completed  successfully,
       the domain registrant will be notified by email.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-domain-transfer-lock
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  domain that you want to remove the transfer lock
          for.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disable the transfer lock on a domain

       The following disable-domain-transfer-lock command removes the transfer
       lock on the domain example.com so that the domain can be transferred to
       another registrar. This command  changes  the  clientTransferProhibited
       status.

       This  command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains disable-domain-transfer-lock \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "3f28e0ac-126a-4113-9048-cc930example"
          }

       To confirm that the  transfer  lock  has  been  changed,  you  can  run
       get-domain-detail  .  When  the transfer lock is disabled, the value of
       StatusList does not include clientTransferProhibited.

       For more information about the transfer  process,  see  Transferring  a
       Domain from Amazon Route 53 to Another Registrar in the Amazon Route 53
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          Identifier for tracking the progress of the request.  To  query  the
          operation status, use GetOperationDetail .
