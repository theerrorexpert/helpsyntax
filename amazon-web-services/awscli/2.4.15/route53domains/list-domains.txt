LIST-DOMAINS()                                                  LIST-DOMAINS()



NAME
       list-domains -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns  all  the  domain names registered with Amazon
       Route 53 for the current Amazon Web Services account  if  no  filtering
       conditions are used.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-domains is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Domains

SYNOPSIS
            list-domains
          [--filter-conditions <value>]
          [--sort-condition <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter-conditions (list)
          A complex type that contains information about the  filters  applied
          during  the  ListDomains  request. The filter conditions can include
          domain name and domain expiration.

          (structure)
              Information for the filtering of a list of domains  returned  by
              ListDomains .

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the field which should be used for filtering the list
                 of domains.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator values for filtering domain  names.  The  values
                 can be:

                 o LE : Less than, or equal to

                 o GE : Greater than, or equal to

                 o BEGINS_WITH : Begins with

              Values -> (list)
                 An array of strings presenting values to compare. Only 1 item
                 in the list is currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Operator=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "DomainName"|"Expiry",
              "Operator": "LE"|"GE"|"BEGINS_WITH",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-condition (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about the requested  order-
          ing of domains in the returned list.

          Name -> (string)
              Field  to  be  used  for  sorting the list of domains. It can be
              either the name or the expiration for a  domain.  Note  that  if
              filterCondition  is used in the same ListDomains call, the field
              used for sorting has to be the same as the field used  for  fil-
              tering.

          SortOrder -> (string)
              The  sort order for a list of domains. Either ascending (ASC) or
              descending (DES).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "DomainName"|"Expiry",
            "SortOrder": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the domains that are registered with the current AWS account

       The  following list-domains command lists summary information about the
       domains that are registered with the current AWS account.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default  region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains list-domains
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "Domains": [
                  {
                      "DomainName": "example.com",
                      "AutoRenew": true,
                      "TransferLock": true,
                      "Expiry": 1602712345.0
                  },
                  {
                      "DomainName": "example.net",
                      "AutoRenew": true,
                      "TransferLock": true,

                  },
                  {
                      "DomainName": "example.org",
                      "AutoRenew": true,
                      "TransferLock": true,
                      "Expiry": 1602734567.0
                  }
              ]
          }

       Domains -> (list)
          A list of domains.

          (structure)

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the domain that the summary information applies

                 expiration.

              TransferLock -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether a domain is locked from unauthorized trans-
                 fer to another party.

              Expiry -> (timestamp)
                 Expiration date of the domain in Unix time format and Coordi-
                 nated Universal Time (UTC).

       NextPageMarker -> (string)
          If  there  are  more  domains than you specified for MaxItems in the
          request, submit another request and include the value  of  NextPage-
          Marker in the value of Marker .
