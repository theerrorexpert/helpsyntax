GET-CONTACT-REACHABILITY-STATUS()            GET-CONTACT-REACHABILITY-STATUS()



NAME
       get-contact-reachability-status -

DESCRIPTION
       For operations that require confirmation that the email address for the
       registrant contact is valid, such as registering  a  new  domain,  this
       operation  returns information about whether the registrant contact has
       responded.

       If you want us to resend the email, use the ResendContactReachabilityE-
       mail operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-contact-reachability-status
          [--domain-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain for which you want to know whether the regis-
          trant contact has confirmed that the email address is valid.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To determine whether the registrant contact has responded to a  confir-
       mation email

       The  following get-contact-reachability-status command returns informa-

       This  command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains get-contact-reachability-status \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       Output:

          {
              "domainName": "example.com",
              "status": "DONE"
          }
