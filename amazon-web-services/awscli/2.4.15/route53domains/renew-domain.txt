RENEW-DOMAIN()                                                  RENEW-DOMAIN()



NAME
       renew-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  renews a domain for the specified number of years. The
       cost of renewing your domain is billed  to  your  Amazon  Web  Services
       account.

       We  recommend that you renew your domain several weeks before the expi-
       ration date. Some TLD registries delete domains before  the  expiration
       date if you haven't renewed far enough in advance. For more information
       about renewing domain registration, see  Renewing  Registration  for  a
       Domain in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            renew-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          [--duration-in-years <value>]
          --current-expiry-year <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain that you want to renew.

       --duration-in-years (integer)
          The number of years that you want to renew the domain for. The maxi-
          mum number of years depends on the top-level domain. For  the  range
          of  valid  values for your domain, see Domains that You Can Register
          with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

          Default: 1

       --current-expiry-year (integer)
          The year when the registration for the domain is set to expire. This
          value must match the current expiration date for the domain.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To renew a domain

       The following renew-domain command renews the specified domain for five
       years.  To   get   the   value   for   current-expiry-year,   use   the
       get-domain-detail command, and convert the value of ExpirationDate from
       Unix format.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default  region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains renew-domain \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com \
              --duration-in-years 5 \
              --current-expiry-year 2020

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "3f28e0ac-126a-4113-9048-cc930example"
          }

       To  confirm  that  the  operation  succeeded,  you  can  run get-opera-
       tion-detail. For more information, see get-operation-detail.

       The registry for each top-level domain (TLD), such  as  .com  or  .org,
       controls  the  maximum number of years that you can renew a domain for.
       To get the maximum renewal period for your domain, see  the  "Registra-
       tion  and  Renewal Period" section for your TLD in Domains That You Can
       Register with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

       For more information, see Renewing Registration for  a  Domain  in  the
       Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          Identifier  for  tracking  the progress of the request. To query the
          operation status, use GetOperationDetail .
