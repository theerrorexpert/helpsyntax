NAME
       delete-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation deletes the specified domain. This action is permanent.
       For more information, see Deleting a domain name registration .

       To transfer the domain  registration  to  another  registrar,  use  the
       transfer  process  thats provided by the registrar to which you want to
       transfer the registration. Otherwise, the following apply:

       o You cant get a refund for the cost of a deleted domain  registration.

       o The  registry for the top-level domain might hold the domain name for
         a brief time before releasing it for other users to register  (varies
         by registry).

       o When the registration has been deleted, we'll send you a confirmation
         to the registrant contact. The email will come  from  noreply@domain-
         nameverification.net or noreply@registrar.amazon.com .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          Name of the domain to be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          Identifier  for  tracking  the progress of the request. To query the
          operation status, use GetOperationDetail .
