CHECK-DOMAIN-TRANSFERABILITY()                  CHECK-DOMAIN-TRANSFERABILITY()



NAME
       check-domain-transferability -

DESCRIPTION
       Checks whether a domain name can be transferred to Amazon Route 53.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            check-domain-transferability
          --domain-name <value>
          [--auth-code <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that you want to transfer to Route 53. The
          top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD  that  Route  53
          supports.  For  a  list  of supported TLDs, see Domains that You Can
          Register with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide
          .

          The domain name can contain only the following characters:

          o Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.

          o Numbers 0 through 9.

          o Hyphen  (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of
            a label.

          o Period (.) to separate the labels in the name, such as  the  .  in
            example.com .

       --auth-code (string)
          If  the  registrar for the top-level domain (TLD) requires an autho-
          rization code to transfer the domain, the code that you got from the
          current registrar for the domain.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To determine whether a domain can be transferred to Route 53

       The  following check-domain-transferability command returns information
       about whether you can transfer the domain name example.com to Route 53.

       This  command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains check-domain-transferability \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       Output:

          {
              "Transferability": {
                  "Transferable": "UNTRANSFERABLE"
              }
          }

       For more information, see Transferring Registration  for  a  Domain  to
       Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Transferability -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about whether the specified
          domain can be transferred to Route 53.

          Transferable -> (string)
              Whether the domain name can be transferred to Route 53.

              NOTE:
                 You can transfer only domains that have a value of  TRANSFER-
                 ABLE for Transferable .

              Valid values:
                 TRANSFERABLE

              The domain name can be transferred to Route 53.
                 UNTRANSFERRABLE

              The domain name can't be transferred to Route 53.
