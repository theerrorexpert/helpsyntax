NAME
       resend-contact-reachability-email -

DESCRIPTION
       For operations that require confirmation that the email address for the
       registrant contact is valid, such as registering  a  new  domain,  this
       operation  resends  the confirmation email to the current email address
       for the registrant contact.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            resend-contact-reachability-email
          [--domain-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain for which you want Route 53 to resend a  con-
          firmation email to the registrant contact.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  resend  the confirmation email to the current email address for the
       registrant contact

       The following  resend-contact-reachability-email  command  resends  the
       confirmation email to the current email address for the registrant con-
       tact for the example.com domain.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default  region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains resend-contact-reachability-email \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       Output:

          {
              "domainName": "example.com",
              "emailAddress": "moliveira@example.com",
              "isAlreadyVerified": true
          }

       If the value of isAlreadyVerified is true, as in this example, the reg-
       istrant contact has already confirmed that the specified email  address
       is reachable.

       For  more  information,  see  Resending  Authorization and Confirmation
       Emails in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       domainName -> (string)
          The domain name for which you requested a confirmation email.

       emailAddress -> (string)
          The email address for the registrant contact at  the  time  that  we
          sent the verification email.

       isAlreadyVerified -> (boolean)
          True  if  the  email  address for the registrant contact has already
          been verified, and false otherwise. If the email address has already
          been verified, we don't send another confirmation email.
