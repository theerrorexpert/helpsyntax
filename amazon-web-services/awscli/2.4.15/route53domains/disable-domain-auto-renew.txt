DISABLE-DOMAIN-AUTO-RENEW()                        DISABLE-DOMAIN-AUTO-RENEW()



NAME
       disable-domain-auto-renew -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  disables  automatic renewal of domain registration for
       the specified domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-domain-auto-renew
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain that you want to  disable  automatic  renewal
          for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disable automatic renewal of a domain

       The  following disable-domain-auto-renew command configures Route 53 to
       not automatically renew the domain example.com before registration  for
       the domain expires.

       This  command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains disable-domain-auto-renew \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       This command produces no output.

       To confirm that the setting was changed, you can run  get-domain-detail
       .  If  automatic  renewal is disabled, the value of AutoRenew is False.
       For more information about automatic renewal, see

OUTPUT
       None
