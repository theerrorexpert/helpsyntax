LIST-OPERATIONS()                                            LIST-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about all of the operations that return an opera-
       tion ID and that have ever been performed on domains that  were  regis-
       tered by the current account.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-operations  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Operations

SYNOPSIS
            list-operations
          [--submitted-since <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --submitted-since (timestamp)
          An optional parameter that lets you get information  about  all  the
          operations that you submitted after a specified date and time. Spec-
          ify the date and time in Unix time format and Coordinated  Universal
          time (UTC).

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the status of operations that return an operation ID

       Some domain registration operations run  asynchronously  and  return  a
       response  before  they  finish. These operations return an operation ID
       that you can use to get the current status. The  following  list-opera-
       tions  command  lists  summary information, including the status, about
       the current domain-registration operations.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default  region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains list-operations
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "Operations": [
                  {
                      "OperationId": "aab9822f-1da0-4bf3-8a15-fd4e0example",
                      "Status": "SUCCESSFUL",
                      "Type": "DOMAIN_LOCK",
                      "SubmittedDate": 1455321739.986
                  },
                  {
                      "OperationId": "c24379ed-76be-42f8-bdad-9379bexample",
                      "Status": "SUCCESSFUL",
                      "Type": "UPDATE_NAMESERVER",
                      "SubmittedDate": 1468960475.109
                  },

                      "OperationId": "f47e1297-ef9e-4c2b-ae1e-a5fcbexample",
                      "Status": "SUCCESSFUL",
                      "Type": "RENEW_DOMAIN",
                      "SubmittedDate": 1473561835.943
                  },
                  {
                      "OperationId": "75584f23-b15f-459e-aed7-dc6f5example",
                      "Status": "SUCCESSFUL",
                      "Type": "UPDATE_DOMAIN_CONTACT",
                      "SubmittedDate": 1547501003.41
                  }
              ]
          }

       The  output includes all the operations that return an operation ID and
       that you have performed on all the domains that you  have  ever  regis-
       tered using the current AWS account. If you want to get only the opera-
       tions that you submitted after a specified date, you  can  include  the
       submitted-since parameter and specify a date in Unix format and Coordi-
       nated Universal Time (UTC). The following command gets  the  status  of
       all  operations  that  were  submitted after 12:00 am UTC on January 1,
       2020.

          aws route53domains list-operations \
              --submitted-since 1577836800
