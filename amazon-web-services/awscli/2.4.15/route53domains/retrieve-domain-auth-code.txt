RETRIEVE-DOMAIN-AUTH-CODE()                        RETRIEVE-DOMAIN-AUTH-CODE()



NAME
       retrieve-domain-auth-code -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns  the  AuthCode  for  the domain. To transfer a
       domain to another registrar, you provide this value to the  new  regis-
       trar.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            retrieve-domain-auth-code
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that you want to get an authorization code
          for.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the authorization code for a domain  so  you  can  transfer  the
       domain to another registrar

       The following retrieve-domain-auth-code command gets the current autho-
       rization code for the  example.com  domain.  You  give  this  value  to
       another  domain  registrar when you want to transfer the domain to that
       registrar.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default  region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains retrieve-domain-auth-code \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       Output:

          {
              "AuthCode": ")o!v3dJeXampLe"
          }
