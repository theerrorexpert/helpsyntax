PUT-DATA-LAKE-SETTINGS()                              PUT-DATA-LAKE-SETTINGS()



NAME
       put-data-lake-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the list of data lake administrators who have admin privileges on
       all resources managed by Lake Formation. For more information on  admin
       privileges, see Granting Lake Formation Permissions .

       This  API  replaces  the  current list of data lake admins with the new
       list being passed. To add an admin, fetch the current list and add  the
       new admin to that list and pass that list in this API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-data-lake-settings
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --data-lake-settings <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains  database
          definitions,  table  definitions,  and  other control information to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --data-lake-settings (structure)
          A structure representing a list of Lake Formation principals  desig-
          nated as data lake administrators.

          DataLakeAdmins -> (list)
              A  list  of  Lake Formation principals. Supported principals are
              IAM users or IAM roles.

              (structure)
                 The Lake Formation principal. Supported  principals  are  IAM
                 users or IAM roles.

                 DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

          CreateDatabaseDefaultPermissions -> (list)
              Specifies  whether  access  control on newly created database is
              managed by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM per-
              missions.  You can override this default setting when you create
              a database.

              A null value indicates access control by Lake Formation  permis-
              sions.  A value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS indi-
              cates access control by IAM permissions. This is referred to  as
              the  setting  "Use only IAM access control," and is for backward
              compatibility with the Glue permission model implemented by  IAM
              permissions.

              The  only  permitted  values are an empty array or an array that
              contains   a   single   JSON   object   that   grants   ALL   to
              IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS.

              For more information, see Changing the Default Security Settings
              for Your Data Lake .

              (structure)
                 Permissions granted to a principal.

                 Principal -> (structure)
                     The principal who is granted permissions.

                     DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                        An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

                 Permissions -> (list)
                     The permissions that are granted to the principal.

                     (string)

          CreateTableDefaultPermissions -> (list)
              Specifies whether access control on newly created table is  man-
              aged by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM permis-
              sions.

              A null value indicates access control by Lake Formation  permis-
              sions.  A value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS indi-
              cates access control by IAM permissions. This is referred to  as
              the  setting  "Use only IAM access control," and is for backward
              compatibility with the Glue permission model implemented by  IAM
              permissions.

              The  only  permitted  values are an empty array or an array that
              contains   a   single   JSON   object   that   grants   ALL   to
              IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS.

              For more information, see Changing the Default Security Settings
              for Your Data Lake .

              (structure)
                 Permissions granted to a principal.

                 Principal -> (structure)
                     The principal who is granted permissions.

                     DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                        An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

                 Permissions -> (list)
                     The permissions that are granted to the principal.

                     (string)

          TrustedResourceOwners -> (list)
              A list of the resource-owning  account  IDs  that  the  caller's
              account  can use to share their user access details (user ARNs).
              The user ARNs can be logged in the resource  owner's  CloudTrail
              log.

              You  may  want  to  specify  this  property  when  you  are in a
              high-trust boundary, such as the same team or company.

              (string)

          AllowExternalDataFiltering -> (boolean)
              Whether to allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data  managed  by
              Lake Formation.

              If  true, you allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data in Amazon
              S3 locations that are registered with Lake Formation.

              If false or null, no Amazon EMR clusters will be able to  access
              data in Amazon S3 locations that are registered with Lake Forma-
              tion.

              For more information, see (Optional)  Allow  Data  Filtering  on
              Amazon EMR .

          ExternalDataFilteringAllowList -> (list)
              A  list  of the account IDs of Amazon Web Services accounts with
              Amazon EMR clusters that are to perform data filtering.>

              (structure)
                 The Lake Formation principal. Supported  principals  are  IAM
                 users or IAM roles.

                 DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

          AuthorizedSessionTagValueList -> (list)
              Lake  Formation relies on a privileged process secured by Amazon
              EMR or the third party integrator to tag the user's  role  while
              assuming   it.   Lake  Formation  will  publish  the  acceptable
              key-value pair, for example key  =  "LakeFormationTrustedCaller"
              and  value = "TRUE" and the third party integrator must properly
              tag the temporary security credentials that will be used to call
              Lake Formation's administrative APIs.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
