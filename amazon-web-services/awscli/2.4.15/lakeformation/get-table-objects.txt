NAME
       get-table-objects -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  set  of Amazon S3 objects that make up the specified gov-
       erned table. A  transaction  ID  or  timestamp  can  be  specified  for
       time-travel queries.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-table-objects
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --database-name <value>
          --table-name <value>
          [--transaction-id <value>]
          [--query-as-of-time <value>]
          [--partition-predicate <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  catalog  containing the governed table. Defaults to the callers
          account.

       --database-name (string)
          The database containing the governed table.

       --table-name (string)
          The governed table for which to retrieve objects.

       --transaction-id (string)
          The transaction ID at which to read the governed table contents.  If
          this  transaction  has  aborted,  an  error is returned. If not set,
          defaults to the most recent committed transaction. Cannot be  speci-
          fied along with QueryAsOfTime .

       --query-as-of-time (timestamp)
          The time as of when to read the governed table contents. If not set,
          the most recent transaction commit time is used. Cannot be specified
          along with TransactionId .

       --partition-predicate (string)
          A  predicate  to  filter the objects returned based on the partition
          keys defined in the governed table.

          o The comparison operators supported are: =, >, <, >=, <=

          o The logical operators supported are: AND

          o The data types  supported  are  integer,  long,  date(yyyy-MM-dd),
            timestamp(yyyy-MM-dd  HH:mm:ssXXX or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"), string
            and decimal.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies how many values to return in a page.

       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token if this is not the first call to retrieve these
          objects.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Objects -> (list)
          A list of objects organized by partition keys.

          (structure)
              A  structure  containing  a  list  of partition values and table
              objects.

              PartitionValues -> (list)
                 A list of partition values.

                 (string)

              Objects -> (list)
                 A list of table objects

                 (structure)

                        TableObjects  for  validation  and  used  to  identify
                        changes to the underlying data.

                     Size -> (long)
                        The size of the Amazon S3 object in bytes.
