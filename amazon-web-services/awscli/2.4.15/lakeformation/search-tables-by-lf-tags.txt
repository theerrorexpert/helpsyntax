SEARCH-TABLES-BY-LF-TAGS()                          SEARCH-TABLES-BY-LF-TAGS()



NAME
       search-tables-by-lf-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation allows a search on TABLE resources by LFTag s. This will
       be used by admins  who  want  to  grant  user  permissions  on  certain
       LF-tags.  Before making a grant, the admin can use SearchTablesByLFTags
       to find all resources where the given  LFTag  s  are  valid  to  verify
       whether the returned resources can be shared.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-tables-by-lf-tags  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: TableList

SYNOPSIS
            search-tables-by-lf-tags
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --expression <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data  Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains database
          definitions, table definitions, and  other  control  information  to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --expression (list)
          A  list  of  conditions  (LFTag  structures)  to search for in table
          resources.

          (structure)
              A structure that allows an admin to grant  user  permissions  on
              certain  conditions.  For example, granting a role access to all
              columns that do not have the LF-tag 'PII' in  tables  that  have
              the LF-tag 'Prod'.

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key-name for the LF-tag.

              TagValues -> (list)
                 A list of possible values an attribute can take.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagKey=string,TagValues=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TagKey": "string",
              "TagValues": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
