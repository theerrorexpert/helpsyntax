SEARCH-DATABASES-BY-LF-TAGS()                    SEARCH-DATABASES-BY-LF-TAGS()



NAME
       search-databases-by-lf-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation allows a search on DATABASE resources by TagCondition .
       This operation is used by admins who want to grant user permissions  on
       certain  TagConditions  .  Before  making  a  grant,  the admin can use
       SearchDatabasesByTags to find all resources where the  given  TagCondi-
       tions are valid to verify whether the returned resources can be shared.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-databases-by-lf-tags is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DatabaseList

SYNOPSIS
            search-databases-by-lf-tags
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --expression <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains  database
          definitions,  table  definitions,  and  other control information to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --expression (list)
          A list of conditions (LFTag structures) to search  for  in  database
          resources.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that  allows an admin to grant user permissions on
              certain conditions. For example, granting a role access  to  all
              columns  that  do  not have the LF-tag 'PII' in tables that have
              the LF-tag 'Prod'.

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key-name for the LF-tag.

              TagValues -> (list)
                 A list of possible values an attribute can take.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagKey=string,TagValues=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TagKey": "string",
              "TagValues": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, present if the current list segment is not the

                 CatalogId -> (string)
                     The identifier for the Data Catalog. By  default,  it  is
                     the account ID of the caller.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  database resource. Unique to the Data

                     CatalogId -> (string)
                        The identifier for the Data Catalog. By  default,  the
                        account  ID.  The Data Catalog is the persistent meta-
                        data store. It contains  database  definitions,  table
                        definitions,  and  other control information to manage
                        your Lake Formation environment.

                     TagKey -> (string)
                        The key-name for the LF-tag.

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        A list of possible values an attribute can take.
