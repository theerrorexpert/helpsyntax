REGISTER-RESOURCE()                                        REGISTER-RESOURCE()



NAME
       register-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog.

       To  add  or  update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the
       chosen Amazon S3 path. Choose a role that you know has permission to do
       this,   or  choose  the  AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess  ser-
       vice-linked role. When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the  ser-
       vice-linked  role  and  a new inline policy are created on your behalf.
       Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it
       to  the  service-linked  role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake
       Formation adds the path to the existing policy.

       The following request registers a new location and gives Lake Formation
       permission to use the service-linked role to access that location.
          ResourceArn = arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket UseServiceLinkedRole = true

       If UseServiceLinkedRole is not set to true, you must provide or set the
       RoleArn :
          arn:aws:iam::12345:role/my-data-access-role

SYNOPSIS
            register-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--use-service-linked-role | --no-use-service-linked-role]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you want to reg-
          ister.

       --use-service-linked-role | --no-use-service-linked-role (boolean)
          Designates  an  Identity  and Access Management (IAM) service-linked
          role by  registering  this  role  with  the  Data  Catalog.  A  ser-
          vice-linked  role  is  a  unique  type  of  IAM  role that is linked
          directly to Lake Formation.

          For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Lake Forma-
          tion .

       --role-arn (string)
          The identifier for the role that registers the resource.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
