START-QUERY-PLANNING()                                  START-QUERY-PLANNING()



NAME
       start-query-planning -

DESCRIPTION
       Submits a request to process a query statement.

       This operation generates work units that can be retrieved with the Get-
       WorkUnits operation as soon as the query state  is  WORKUNITS_AVAILABLE
       or FINISHED.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-query-planning
          --query-planning-context <value>
          --query-string <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-planning-context (structure)
          A structure containing information about the query plan.

          CatalogId -> (string)
              The  ID  of  the  Data  Catalog  where the partition in question
              resides. If none is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID
              is used by default.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The database containing the table.

          QueryAsOfTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time as of when to read the table contents. If not set, the
              most recent transaction commit time  will  be  used.  Cannot  be
              specified along with TransactionId .

          QueryParameters -> (map)
              A map consisting of key-value pairs.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          TransactionId -> (string)
              The  transaction ID at which to read the table contents. If this
              transaction is not committed, the read will be treated  as  part
              of that transaction and will see its writes. If this transaction
              has aborted, an error will be returned. If not set, defaults  to
              the most recent committed transaction. Cannot be specified along
              with QueryAsOfTime .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CatalogId=string,DatabaseName=string,QueryAsOfTime=timestamp,QueryParameters={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},TransactionId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CatalogId": "string",
            "DatabaseName": "string",
            "QueryAsOfTime": timestamp,
            "QueryParameters": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "TransactionId": "string"
          }

       --query-string (string)
          A PartiQL query statement used as an input to the planner service.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       QueryId -> (string)
          The ID of the plan query operation can be used to fetch  the  actual
          work  unit descriptors that are produced as the result of the opera-
          tion. The ID is also used to get the query state and as an input  to
          the Execute operation.
