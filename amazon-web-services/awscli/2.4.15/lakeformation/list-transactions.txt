LIST-TRANSACTIONS()                                        LIST-TRANSACTIONS()



NAME
       list-transactions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata  about  transactions and their status. To prevent the
       response from growing indefinitely, only uncommitted  transactions  and
       those available for time-travel queries are returned.

       This operation can help you identify uncommitted transactions or to get
       information about transactions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-transactions
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          [--status-filter <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The catalog for which to list transactions. Defaults to the  account
          ID of the caller.

       --status-filter (string)
          A  filter  indicating  the status of transactions to return. Options
          are ALL | COMPLETED | COMMITTED | ABORTED | ACTIVE. The  default  is
          ALL .

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o COMPLETED

          o ACTIVE

          o COMMITTED

          o ABORTED

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of transactions to return in a single call.

       --next-token (string)
          A  continuation  token  if  this  is  not the first call to retrieve
          transactions.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Transactions -> (list)
          A list of transactions. The record for each transaction is a  Trans-

          (structure)
              A structure that contains information about a transaction.

              TransactionId -> (string)
                 The ID of the transaction.

              TransactionStatus -> (string)
                 A status of ACTIVE, COMMITTED, or ABORTED.

              TransactionStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the transaction started.

              TransactionEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time when the transaction committed or aborted, if it is
                 not currently active.

       NextToken -> (string)
