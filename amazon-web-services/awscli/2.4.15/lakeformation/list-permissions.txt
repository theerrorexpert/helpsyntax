LIST-PERMISSIONS()                                          LIST-PERMISSIONS()



NAME
       list-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the principal permissions on the resource, filtered
       by the permissions of the caller. For example, if you  are  granted  an
       ALTER  permission,  you  are able to see only the principal permissions
       for ALTER.

       This operation returns only those permissions that have been explicitly
       granted.

       For  information  about permissions, see Security and Access Control to
       Metadata and Data .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          manage your Lake Formation environment.

          Specifies a principal to filter the permissions returned.

          DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
              An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DataLakePrincipalIdentifier=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DataLakePrincipalIdentifier": "string"
          }

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies a resource type to filter the permissions returned.

          Possible values:

          This  operation  does not support getting privileges on a table with
          columns. Instead, call this operation on the table, and  the  opera-
          tion returns the table and the table w columns.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the

       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
