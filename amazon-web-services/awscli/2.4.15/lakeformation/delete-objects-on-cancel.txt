DELETE-OBJECTS-ON-CANCEL()                          DELETE-OBJECTS-ON-CANCEL()



NAME
       delete-objects-on-cancel -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a  specific  governed  table, provides a list of Amazon S3 objects
       that will be written during the current transaction  and  that  can  be
       automatically  deleted  if  the  transaction  is canceled. Without this
       call, no Amazon S3 objects are automatically deleted when a transaction
       cancels.

       The   Glue   ETL  library  function  write_dynamic_frame.from_catalog()
       includes an option to automatically call  DeleteObjectsOnCancel  before
       writes. For more information, see Rolling Back Amazon S3 Writes .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-objects-on-cancel
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --database-name <value>
          --table-name <value>
          --transaction-id <value>
          --objects <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  Glue data catalog that contains the governed table. Defaults to
          the current account ID.

       --database-name (string)
          The database that contains the governed table.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the governed table.

       --transaction-id (string)
          ID of the transaction that the writes occur in.

       --objects (list)
          A list of VirtualObject structures, which indicates  the  Amazon  S3
          objects to be deleted if the transaction cancels.

          (structure)
              An  object  that  defines an Amazon S3 object to be deleted if a
              transaction cancels, provided that VirtualPut was called  before
              writing the object.

              Uri -> (string)
                 The path to the Amazon S3 object. Must start with s3://

              ETag -> (string)
                 The ETag of the Amazon S3 object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Uri=string,ETag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Uri": "string",
              "ETag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
