NAME
       update-s3-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  classification  types  for the specified S3 resources. If
       memberAccountId isn't specified, the action updates the  classification
       types  of the S3 resources associated with Amazon Macie Classic for the
       current Macie Classic  administrator  account.  If  memberAccountId  is
       specified,  the  action  updates  the  classification  types  of the S3
       resources associated  with  Macie  Classic  for  the  specified  member
       account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-s3-resources
          [--member-account-id <value>]
          --s3-resources-update <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --member-account-id (string)
          The  AWS  ID  of  the  Amazon  Macie Classic member account whose S3
          resources' classification types you want to update.

       --s3-resources-update (list)
          The S3 resources whose classification types you want to update.

          (structure)
              The S3 resources whose classification types you want to  update.
              This   data   type  is  used  as  a  request  parameter  in  the
              UpdateS3Resources action.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket whose classification types you want
                 to update.

              prefix -> (string)
                 The  prefix  of  the S3 bucket whose classification types you
                 want to update.

              classificationTypeUpdate -> (structure)
                 The classification type that  you  want  to  update  for  the
                 resource associated with Amazon Macie Classic.

                 oneTime -> (string)
                     A  one-time classification of all of the existing objects
                     in a specified S3 bucket.

                 continuous -> (string)
                     A continuous classification of the objects that are added
                     to  a  specified  S3  bucket. Amazon Macie Classic begins
                     performing continuous classification after  a  bucket  is
                     successfully associated with Macie Classic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string,prefix=string,classificationTypeUpdate={oneTime=string,continuous=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "prefix": "string",
              "classificationTypeUpdate": {
                "oneTime": "FULL"|"NONE",
                "continuous": "FULL"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       failedS3Resources -> (list)
          The  S3  resources  whose  classification types can't be updated. An
          error code and an error message are provided for each failed item.

          (structure)
              Includes details about the failed S3 resources.

              failedItem -> (structure)
                 The failed S3 resources.

                 bucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket.

                 prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix of the S3 bucket.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The status code of a failed item.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message of a failed item.
