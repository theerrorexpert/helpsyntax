NAME
       associate-s3-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  specified  S3 resources with Amazon Macie Classic for moni-
       toring and data classification. If memberAccountId isn't specified, the
       action  associates  specified  S3  resources with Macie Classic for the
       current Macie Classic  administrator  account.  If  memberAccountId  is
       specified,  the  action  associates  specified  S3 resources with Macie
       Classic for the specified member account.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-s3-resources
          [--member-account-id <value>]
          --s3-resources <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --member-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Macie Classic member  account  whose  resources
          you want to associate with Macie Classic.

       --s3-resources (list)
          The  S3 resources that you want to associate with Amazon Macie Clas-
          sic for monitoring and data classification.

          (structure)
              The S3 resources that you want to associate  with  Amazon  Macie
              Classic  for  monitoring and data classification. This data type
              is used as  a  request  parameter  in  the  AssociateS3Resources
              action and a response parameter in the ListS3Resources action.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  S3 bucket that you want to associate with
                 Amazon Macie Classic.

              prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix of the S3 bucket that you want to  associate  with
                 Amazon Macie Classic.

              classificationType -> (structure)
                 The  classification  type  that  you  want to specify for the
                 resource associated with Amazon Macie Classic.

                 oneTime -> (string)
                     A one-time classification of all of the existing  objects
                     in a specified S3 bucket.

                 continuous -> (string)
                     A continuous classification of the objects that are added
                     to a specified S3 bucket.  Amazon  Macie  Classic  begins
                     performing  continuous  classification  after a bucket is
                     successfully associated with Macie Classic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string,prefix=string,classificationType={oneTime=string,continuous=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "prefix": "string",
              "classificationType": {
                "oneTime": "FULL"|"NONE",
                "continuous": "FULL"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          S3 resources that couldn't be associated with Amazon Macie  Classic.

              failedItem -> (structure)
