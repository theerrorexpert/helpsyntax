LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the jobs for a branch of an Amplify app.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: jobSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          --app-id <value>
          --branch-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID for an Amplify app.

       --branch-name (string)
          The name for a branch.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobSummaries -> (list)
          The result structure for the list job result request.

          (structure)
              Describes the summary for an execution job for an Amplify app.

              jobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the job.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The unique ID for the job.

              commitId -> (string)
                 The  commit ID from a third-party repository provider for the
                 job.

              commitMessage -> (string)
                 The commit message from a third-party repository provider for
                 the job.

              commitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The commit date and time for the job.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start date and time for the job.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status for the job.

              endTime -> (timestamp)
                 The end date and time for the job.

              jobType -> (string)
                 The  type  for the job. If the value is RELEASE , the job was
                 manually released from its source by using the StartJob  API.
                 If  the  value  is RETRY , the job was manually retried using
                 the StartJob API. If the value is  WEB_HOOK  ,  the  job  was
                 automatically triggered by webhooks.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination token. If non-null the pagination token is returned in
          a result. Pass  its  value  in  another  request  to  retrieve  more
          entries.
