          Possible values:

          o PRODUCTION

          o BETA

          Enables notifications for the branch.

       --enable-auto-build | --no-enable-auto-build (boolean)
          Enables auto building for the branch.

       --environment-variables (map)
          The environment variables for the branch.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --basic-auth-credentials (string)
          The  basic  authorization  credentials  for  the  branch.  You  must
          base64-encode the authorization credentials and provide them in  the
          format user:password .

       --enable-basic-auth | --no-enable-basic-auth (boolean)
          Enables basic authorization for the branch.

       --enable-performance-mode | --no-enable-performance-mode (boolean)
          Enables performance mode for the branch.

          Performance mode optimizes for faster hosting performance by keeping
          content cached at the edge for a longer interval.  When  performance
          mode  is  enabled, hosting configuration or code changes can take up
          to 10 minutes to roll out.

       --build-spec (string)
          The build specification (build spec) for the branch.

       --ttl (string)
          The content Time to Live (TTL) for the website in seconds.

       --display-name (string)
          The display name for a branch. This is used as  the  default  domain
          prefix.

       --enable-pull-request-preview     |    --no-enable-pull-request-preview
       (boolean)
          Enables pull request previews for this branch.

       --pull-request-environment-name (string)
          The Amplify environment name for the pull request.

       --backend-environment-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a  backend  environment  that  is
          part of an Amplify app.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
