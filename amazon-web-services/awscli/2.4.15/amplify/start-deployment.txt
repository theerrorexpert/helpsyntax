       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-deployment
          --app-id <value>
          --branch-name <value>
          [--job-id <value>]
          [--source-url <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID for an Amplify app.

       --branch-name (string)
          The name for the branch, for the job.

       --job-id (string)
          The job ID for this deployment, generated by the  create  deployment
          request.

       --source-url (string)
          The  source URL for this deployment, used when calling start deploy-
          ment without create deployment. The source URL can be any  HTTP  GET
          URL that is publicly accessible and downloads a single .zip file.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
