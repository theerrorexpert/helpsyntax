NAME
       create-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  deployment  for  a  manually deployed Amplify app. Manually
       deployed apps are not connected to a repository.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-deployment
          --app-id <value>
          --branch-name <value>
          [--file-map <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID for an Amplify app.

       --branch-name (string)
          The name for the branch, for the job.

       --file-map (map)
          An optional file map that contains the file name as the key and  the
          file  content  md5  hash as the value. If this argument is provided,
          the service will generate a unique upload URL per  file.  Otherwise,
          the  service  will  only generate a single upload URL for the zipped
          files.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobId -> (string)
          The job ID for this deployment. will supply to start deployment api.

       fileUploadUrls -> (map)
          When the fileMap argument is provided in the request, fileUploadUrls
          will contain a map of file names to upload URLs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       zipUploadUrl -> (string)
          When the fileMap argument is not provided in the request, this zipU-
          ploadUrl is returned.
