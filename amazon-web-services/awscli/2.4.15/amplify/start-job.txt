          --app-id <value>
          --branch-name <value>
          [--job-id <value>]

          [--commit-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID for an Amplify app.

       --branch-name (string)
          The branch name for the job.

       --job-id (string)
          The  unique ID for an existing job. This is required if the value of
          jobType is RETRY .

       --job-type (string)
          Describes the type for the job. The job type RELEASE  starts  a  new
          job  with the latest change from the specified branch. This value is
          available only for apps that are connected to a repository. The  job
          type RETRY retries an existing job. If the job type value is RETRY ,
          the jobId is also required.

          Possible values:

          o RELEASE

          o RETRY

          o MANUAL

          o WEB_HOOK

       --job-reason (string)
          A descriptive reason for starting this job.

       --commit-id (string)
          The commit ID from a third-party repository provider for the job.

       --commit-message (string)
          The commit message from a third-party repository  provider  for  the
          job.

       --commit-time (timestamp)
          The commit date and time for the job.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
