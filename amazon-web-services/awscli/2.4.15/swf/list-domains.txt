LIST-DOMAINS()                                                  LIST-DOMAINS()



NAME
       list-domains -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the list of domains registered in the account. The results may
       be split into multiple pages. To retrieve subsequent  pages,  make  the
       call again using the nextPageToken returned by the initial call.

       NOTE:
              This  operation  is  eventually consistent. The results are best
              effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only   specified   domains.   The   element   must    be    set    to
         arn:aws:swf::AccountID:domain/*  , where AccountID is the account ID,
         with no dashes.

       o Use an Action element to  allow  or  deny  permission  to  call  this
         action.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside  the  specified  constraints,  the
       action  fails.  The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set
       to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-domains is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: domainInfos

SYNOPSIS
            list-domains
          --registration-status <value>
          [--reverse-order | --no-reverse-order]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registration-status (string)
          Specifies the registration status of the domains to list.

          Possible values:

          o REGISTERED

          o DEPRECATED

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          When set to true , returns the results in reverse order. By default,
          the results are returned in ascending alphabetical order by name  of
          the domains.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
   Listing your Domains
       To list the SWF domains that you have registered for your account,  you
       can  use swf list-domains. There is only one required parameter: --reg-
       istration-status, which you can set to either REGISTERED or DEPRECATED.

       Here's a typical example:

          aws swf list-domains --registration-status REGISTERED

       Result:

          {
            "domainInfos": [
              {
                "status": "REGISTERED",
                "name": "DataFrobotz"
              },
              {
                "status": "REGISTERED",
                "name": "erontest"
              }
            ]
          }

       If you set --registration-status to DEPRECATED, you will see deprecated
       domains (domains that can not register new workflows or activities, but
       that can still be queried). For example:

          aws swf list-domains --registration-status DEPRECATED

       Result:

          {
            "domainInfos": [
              {
                "status": "DEPRECATED",
                "name": "MyNeatNewDomain"
              }
            ]
          }

       If you have many domains, you can set the --maximum-page-size option to
       limit the number of results returned. If  there  are  more  results  to
       return  than  the maximum number that you specified, you will receive a
       nextPageToken that you can send to the next  call  to  list-domains  to
       retrieve additional entries.

       Here's an example of using --maximum-page-size:

          aws swf list-domains --registration-status REGISTERED --maximum-page-size 1

       Result:

          {
            "domainInfos": [
              {
                "status": "REGISTERED",
                "name": "DataFrobotz"
              }
            ],
            "nextPageToken": "AAAAKgAAAAEAAAAAAAAAA2QJKNtidVgd49TTeNwYcpD+QKT2ynuEbibcQWe2QKrslMGe63gpS0MgZGpcpoKttL4OCXRFn98Xif557it+wSZUsvUDtImjDLvguyuyyFdIZtvIxIKEOPm3k2r4OjAGaFsGOuVbrKljvla7wdU7FYH3OlkNCP8b7PBj9SBkUyGoiAghET74P93AuVIIkdKGtQ=="
          }

       When  you  make  the  call  again,  this  time  supplying  the value of
       nextPageToken in the --next-page-token  argument,  you'll  get  another
       page of results:

          aws swf list-domains --registration-status REGISTERED --maximum-page-size 1 --next-page-token "AAAAKgAAAAEAAAAAAAAAA2QJKNtidVgd49TTeNwYcpD+QKT2ynuEbibcQWe2QKrslMGe63gpS0MgZGpcpoKttL4OCXRFn98Xif557it+wSZUsvUDtImjDLvguyuyyFdIZtvIxIKEOPm3k2r4OjAGaFsGOuVbrKljvla7wdU7FYH3OlkNCP8b7PBj9SBkUyGoiAghET74P93AuVIIkdKGtQ=="

       Result:

          {
            "domainInfos": [
              {
                "status": "REGISTERED",
                "name": "erontest"
              }
            ]
          }

       When  there  are no further pages of results to retrieve, nextPageToken
       will not be returned in the results.

OUTPUT
       domainInfos -> (list)
          A list of DomainInfo structures.

          (structure)
              Contains general information about a domain.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the  domain.  This  name  is  unique  within  the
                 account.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the domain:

                 o REGISTERED   The  domain  is properly registered and avail-
                   able. You can use this domain  for  registering  types  and
                   creating new workflow executions.

                 o DEPRECATED   The  domain was deprecated using  DeprecateDo-
                   main , but is still in use. You should not create new work-
                   flow executions in this domain.

              description -> (string)
                 The  description  of the domain provided through  RegisterDo-
                 main .

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the domain.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          If a NextPageToken was returned by a previous call, there  are  more
          results  available.  To  retrieve the next page of results, make the
          call again using the returned token  in  nextPageToken  .  Keep  all
          other arguments unchanged.

          The  configured  maximumPageSize  determines how many results can be
          returned in a single call.
