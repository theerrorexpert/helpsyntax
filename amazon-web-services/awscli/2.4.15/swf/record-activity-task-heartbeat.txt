RECORD-ACTIVITY-TASK-HEARTBEAT()              RECORD-ACTIVITY-TASK-HEARTBEAT()



NAME
       record-activity-task-heartbeat -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by  activity workers to report to the service that the  Activity-
       Task represented by the specified taskToken is still  making  progress.
       The  worker  can also specify details of the progress, for example per-
       cent complete, using the details parameter. This  action  can  also  be
       used  by  the  worker  as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being
       requested for the activity task. If a cancellation is  being  attempted
       for  the specified task, then the boolean cancelRequested flag returned
       by the service is set to true .

       This action resets the taskHeartbeatTimeout clock.  The  taskHeartbeat-
       Timeout is specified in  RegisterActivityType .

       This action doesn't in itself create an event in the workflow execution
       history. However, if the task times out, the workflow execution history
       contains  a  ActivityTaskTimedOut  event  that contains the information
       from the last heartbeat generated by the activity worker.

       NOTE:
          The taskStartToCloseTimeout of an activity type is the maximum dura-
          tion of an activity task, regardless of the number of  RecordActivi-
          tyTaskHeartbeat requests received.  The  taskStartToCloseTimeout  is
          also specified in  RegisterActivityType .

       NOTE:
          This  operation  is  only useful for long-lived activities to report
          liveliness of the task and to determine if a cancellation  is  being
          attempted.

       WARNING:
              If  the  cancelRequested  flag  returns true , a cancellation is
              being attempted. If the  worker  can  cancel  the  activity,  it
              should respond with  RespondActivityTaskCanceled . Otherwise, it
              should ignore the cancellation request.

          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to  allow  or  deny  permission  to  call  this
         action.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside  the  specified  constraints,  the
       action  fails.  The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set
       to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            record-activity-task-heartbeat
          --task-token <value>
          [--details <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-token (string)
          The taskToken of the  ActivityTask .

          WARNING:
              taskToken is generated by the service and should be  treated  as
              an  opaque  value. If the task is passed to another process, its
              taskToken must also be passed. This enables it  to  provide  its
              progress and respond with results.

       --details (string)
          If specified, contains details about the progress of the task.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       cancelRequested -> (boolean)
          Set to true if cancellation of the task is requested.
