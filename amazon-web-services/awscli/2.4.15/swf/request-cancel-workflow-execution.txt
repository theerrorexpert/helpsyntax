REQUEST-CANCEL-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()        REQUEST-CANCEL-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()



NAME
       request-cancel-workflow-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Records  a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in the currently run-
       ning workflow execution identified by the given domain, workflowId, and
       runId.  This logically requests the cancellation of the workflow execu-
       tion as a whole. It is up to the decider to  take  appropriate  actions
       when it receives an execution history with this event.

       NOTE:
          If  the  runId isn't specified, the WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested
          event is recorded in the history of the current open workflow execu-
          tion with the specified workflowId in the domain.

       NOTE:
              Because this action allows the workflow to properly clean up and
              gracefully close, it should be used instead  of   TerminateWork-
              flowExecution when possible.

          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element  to  allow  or  deny permission to call this
         action.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or  the  parameter  values  fall outside the specified constraints, the
       action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter  is  set
       to  OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies, see
       Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in  the  Amazon  SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            request-cancel-workflow-execution
          --domain <value>
          --workflow-id <value>
          [--run-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name of the domain containing the workflow execution to cancel.

       --workflow-id (string)
          The workflowId of the workflow execution to cancel.

       --run-id (string)
          The runId of the workflow execution to cancel.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
