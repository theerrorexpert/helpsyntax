COUNT-PENDING-DECISION-TASKS()                  COUNT-PENDING-DECISION-TASKS()



NAME
       count-pending-decision-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  estimated  number of decision tasks in the specified task
       list. The count returned is an approximation and isn't guaranteed to be
       exact. If you specify a task list that no decision task was ever sched-
       uled in then 0 is returned.
          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to  allow  or  deny  permission  to  call  this
         action.

       o Constrain  the  taskList.name  parameter by using a Condition element
         with the swf:taskList.name key to allow the  action  to  access  only
         certain task lists.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside  the  specified  constraints,  the
       action  fails.  The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set
       to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            count-pending-decision-tasks
          --domain <value>
          --task-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the task list.

       --task-list (structure)
          The name of the task list.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the task list.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       count -> (integer)
          The number of tasks in the task list.

       truncated -> (boolean)
          If set to true, indicates that the actual count was  more  than  the
          maximum  supported  by  this API and the count returned is the trun-
          cated value.
