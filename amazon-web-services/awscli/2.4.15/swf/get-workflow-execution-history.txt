GET-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-HISTORY()              GET-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-HISTORY()



NAME
       get-workflow-execution-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  history  of the specified workflow execution. The results
       may be split into multiple pages. To retrieve  subsequent  pages,  make
       the call again using the nextPageToken returned by the initial call.

       NOTE:
              This  operation  is  eventually consistent. The results are best
              effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to  allow  or  deny  permission  to  call  this
         action.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside  the  specified  constraints,  the
       action  fails.  The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set
       to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

       get-workflow-execution-history is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: events

SYNOPSIS
            get-workflow-execution-history
          --domain <value>
          --execution <value>
          [--reverse-order | --no-reverse-order]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain containing the workflow execution.

       --execution (structure)
          Specifies the workflow execution for which to return the history.

          workflowId -> (string)
              The  user defined identifier associated with the workflow execu-
              tion.

          runId -> (string)
              A system-generated unique identifier for the workflow execution.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          workflowId=string,runId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "workflowId": "string",
            "runId": "string"
          }

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          When  set  to true , returns the events in reverse order. By default
          the results are returned in ascending order of the eventTimeStamp of
          the events.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 tifies the event with in the workflow execution history.

              workflowExecutionStartedEventAttributes -> (structure)
                 If the event is of type  WorkflowExecutionStarted  then  this
                 member  is  set  and  provides detailed information about the
                 event. It isn't set for other event types.

                     this workflow execution is  terminated,  by  calling  the
                     TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an
                     expired timeout.

                       CancelRequested event in its history. It is up  to  the
                       decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an
                       execution history with this event.

                     o ABANDON  No action is taken. The child executions  con-

                 continuedExecutionRunId -> (string)
                     If this workflow execution was started due to  a  Contin-
                     ueAsNewWorkflowExecution  decision,  then it contains the
                     runId of the previous workflow execution that was  closed
                     and continued as this execution.

                     The  source workflow execution that started this workflow
                     execution. The member isn't set if the workflow execution
                     was not started by a workflow.

                     workflowId -> (string)
                        The  user defined identifier associated with the work-

                     corresponding to the StartChildWorkflowExecution    Deci-
                     sion  to  start this workflow execution. The source event
                     with this ID can be found in the history  of  the  source
                     workflow  execution.  This  information can be useful for
                     diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain  of  events
                     leading up to this event.

                 lambdaRole -> (string)
                     The IAM role attached to the workflow execution.

              workflowExecutionCompletedEventAttributes -> (structure)

                     The ID of the DecisionTaskCompleted  event  corresponding
                     to  the  decision task that resulted in the CompleteWork-
                     flowExecution decision to complete this  execution.  This
                     information  can  be  useful  for  diagnosing problems by
                     tracing back the chain  of  events  leading  up  to  this
                     event.

              completeWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes -> (structure)
                 If  the event is of type CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed then
                 this member is set and provides  detailed  information  about
