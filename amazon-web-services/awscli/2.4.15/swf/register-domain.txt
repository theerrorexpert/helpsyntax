REGISTER-DOMAIN()                                            REGISTER-DOMAIN()



NAME
       register-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a new domain.
          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o You cannot use an IAM  policy  to  control  domain  access  for  this
         action.  The  name of the domain being registered is available as the
         resource of this action.

       o Use an Action element to  allow  or  deny  permission  to  call  this
         action.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside  the  specified  constraints,  the
       action  fails.  The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set
       to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            register-domain
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --workflow-execution-retention-period-in-days <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Name of the domain to register. The  name  must  be  unique  in  the
          region that the domain is registered in.

          The  specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must
          not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control
          characters  (\u0000-\u001f  |  \u007f-\u009f ). Also, it must not be
          the literal string arn .

       --description (string)
          A text description of the domain.

       --workflow-execution-retention-period-in-days (string)
          The duration (in days) that records and histories of workflow execu-
          tions  on the domain should be kept by the service. After the reten-
          tion period, the workflow execution isn't available in  the  results
          of visibility calls.

          If  you pass the value NONE or 0 (zero), then the workflow execution
          history isn't retained. As soon as the workflow execution completes,
          the execution record and its history are deleted.

          The maximum workflow execution retention period is 90 days. For more
          information about Amazon SWF service limits, see: Amazon SWF Service
          Limits in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

       --tags (list)
          Tags to be added when registering a domain.

          Tags  may only contain unicode letters, digits, whitespace, or these
          symbols: _ . : / = + - @ .

          (structure)
              Tags are key-value pairs that can be associated with Amazon  SWF
              state machines and activities.

              Tags  may  only  contain unicode letters, digits, whitespace, or
              these symbols: _ . : / = + - @ .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of a tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of a tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
   Registering a Domain
       You can use the AWS CLI to register new domains.  Use  the  swf  regis-
       ter-domain  command.   There are two required parameters, --name, which
       takes    the    domain    name,     and     --workflow-execution-reten-
       tion-period-in-days,  which  takes  an integer to specify the number of
       days to retain workflow execution data on this domain, up to  a  maxium
       period   of   90   days   (for   more  information,  see  the  SWF  FAQ
       <http://aws.amazon.com/swf/faqs/#retain_limit>).   Workflow   execution
       data  will  not  be  retained  after  the specified number of days have
       passed.

       Here's an example of registering a new domain:

          $ aws swf register-domain --name MyNeatNewDomain --workflow-execution-retention-period-in-days 0
          ""

       When you register a domain, nothing is returned (""), but you  can  use
       swf  list-domains  or  swf  describe-domain to see the new domain.  For
       example:

          $ aws swf list-domains --registration-status REGISTERED
          {
              "domainInfos": [
                  {
                      "status": "REGISTERED",
                      "name": "DataFrobotz"
                  },
                  {
                      "status": "REGISTERED",
                      "name": "MyNeatNewDomain"
                  },
                  {
                      "status": "REGISTERED",
                      "name": "erontest"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Using swf describe-domain:

          aws swf describe-domain --name MyNeatNewDomain
          {
              "domainInfo": {
                  "status": "REGISTERED",
                  "name": "MyNeatNewDomain"
              },
              "configuration": {
                  "workflowExecutionRetentionPeriodInDays": "0"
              }
          }
