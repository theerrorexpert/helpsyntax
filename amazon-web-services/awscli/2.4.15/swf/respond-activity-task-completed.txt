RESPOND-ACTIVITY-TASK-COMPLETED()            RESPOND-ACTIVITY-TASK-COMPLETED()



NAME
       respond-activity-task-completed -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by  workers to tell the service that the  ActivityTask identified
       by the taskToken completed successfully with a  result  (if  provided).
       The  result  appears in the ActivityTaskCompleted event in the workflow
       history.

       WARNING:
          If the requested task doesn't complete successfully, use  RespondAc-
          tivityTaskFailed  instead. If the worker finds that the task is can-
          celed through the canceled  flag  returned  by   RecordActivityTask-
          Heartbeat  ,  it  should  cancel  the  task,  clean up and then call
          RespondActivityTaskCanceled .

       A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled  until  it
       is  closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is pro-
       cessing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a  call  to
       RespondActivityTaskCompleted,   RespondActivityTaskCanceled  ,  Respon-
       dActivityTaskFailed , or the task has timed out .
          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to  allow  or  deny  permission  to  call  this
         action.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside  the  specified  constraints,  the
       action  fails.  The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set
       to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            respond-activity-task-completed
          --task-token <value>
          [--result <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-token (string)
          The taskToken of the  ActivityTask .

          WARNING:
              taskToken is generated by the service and should be  treated  as
              an  opaque  value. If the task is passed to another process, its
              taskToken must also be passed. This enables it  to  provide  its
              progress and respond with results.

       --result (string)
          The  result  of  the activity task. It is a free form string that is
          implementation specific.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
