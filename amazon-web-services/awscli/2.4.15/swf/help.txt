DESCRIPTION
       The  Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build
       applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distrib-
       uted  components.  In  Amazon  SWF, a task represents a logical unit of
       work that is performed by a component of  your  workflow.  Coordinating
       tasks  in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, schedul-
       ing, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the  appli-
       cation.

       Amazon  SWF  gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordi-
       nating them without worrying  about  underlying  complexities  such  as
       tracking their progress and maintaining their state.

       This  documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of
       the Amazon SWF programming model, see the * Amazon SWF Developer  Guide
       * .
