DESCRIBE-ACTIVITY-TYPE()                              DESCRIBE-ACTIVITY-TYPE()



NAME
       describe-activity-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the specified activity type. This includes
       configuration settings provided when the type was registered and  other
       general information about the type.
          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element  to  allow  or  deny permission to call this
         action.

       o Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element  with
         the appropriate keys.

         o activityType.name  :  String  constraint.  The key is swf:activity-
           Type.name .

         o activityType.version : String constraint. The key is  swf:activity-
           Type.version .

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside  the  specified  constraints,  the
       action  fails.  The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set
       to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-activity-type
          --domain <value>
          --activity-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain in which the activity type is registered.

       --activity-type (structure)
          The activity type to get information about. Activity types are iden-
          tified  by the name and version that were supplied when the activity
          was registered.

          name -> (string)
              The name of this activity.

              NOTE:
                 The combination of activity type name  and  version  must  be
                 unique within a domain.

          version -> (string)
              The version of this activity.

              NOTE:
                 The  combination  of  activity  type name and version must be
                 unique with in a domain.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       typeInfo -> (structure)
          General information about the activity type.

          The status of activity type (returned in the ActivityTypeInfo struc-
          ture) can be one of the following.

          o REGISTERED  The type is registered and available. Workers support-
            ing this type should be running.

          o DEPRECATED  The type was deprecated using  DeprecateActivityType ,
            but  is still in use. You should keep workers supporting this type
            running. You cannot create new tasks of this type.

          activityType -> (structure)
              The  ActivityType type structure representing the activity type.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of this activity.

                 NOTE:
                     The combination of activity type name and version must be
                     unique within a domain.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of this activity.

                 NOTE:
                     The combination of activity type name and version must be
                     unique with in a domain.

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the activity type.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the activity type provided in  RegisterActiv-
              ityType .

          creationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time this activity type was created through  Regis-
              terActivityType .

          deprecationDate -> (timestamp)
              If  DEPRECATED,  the  date  and  time  DeprecateActivityType was
              called.

       configuration -> (structure)
          The configuration settings registered with the activity type.

          defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The default maximum duration for tasks of an activity type spec-
              ified  when registering the activity type. You can override this
              default when scheduling a task through the  ScheduleActivityTask
              Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultTaskHeartbeatTimeout -> (string)
              The default maximum time, in seconds, before which a worker pro-
              cessing  a task must report progress by calling  RecordActivity-
              TaskHeartbeat .

              You can specify this value only  when  registering  an  activity
              type.  The  registered  default value can be overridden when you
              schedule a task through the ScheduleActivityTask   Decision . If
              the  activity worker subsequently attempts to record a heartbeat
              or returns a result, the activity worker receives an  UnknownRe-
              source  fault.  In this case, Amazon SWF no longer considers the
              activity task to be valid; the activity worker should  clean  up
              the activity task.

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultTaskList -> (structure)
              The default task list specified for this activity type at regis-
              tration. This default is used if a task list isn't provided when
              a task is scheduled through the ScheduleActivityTask    Decision
              .  You can override the default registered task list when sched-
              uling a task through the ScheduleActivityTask   Decision .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the task list.

          defaultTaskPriority -> (string)
              The default task priority for tasks of this activity type, spec-
              ified at registration. If not set, then 0 is used as the default
              priority. This default can  be  overridden  when  scheduling  an
              activity task.

              Valid   values   are  integers  that  range  from  Java's  Inte-
              ger.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to  Integer.MAX_VALUE  (2147483647).
              Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

              For  more  information  about setting task priority, see Setting
              Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

          defaultTaskScheduleToStartTimeout -> (string)
              The default maximum duration,  specified  when  registering  the
              activity  type,  that a task of an activity type can wait before
              being assigned to a worker. You can override this  default  when
              scheduling  a task through the ScheduleActivityTask   Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultTaskScheduleToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The  default  maximum  duration,  specified when registering the
              activity type, for tasks of this activity type. You can override
              this  default when scheduling a task through the ScheduleActivi-
              tyTask   Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.
