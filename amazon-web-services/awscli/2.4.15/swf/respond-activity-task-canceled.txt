RESPOND-ACTIVITY-TASK-CANCELED()              RESPOND-ACTIVITY-TASK-CANCELED()



NAME
       respond-activity-task-canceled -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by  workers to tell the service that the  ActivityTask identified
       by the taskToken was successfully canceled. Additional details  can  be
       provided using the details argument.

       These  details  (if  provided) appear in the ActivityTaskCanceled event
       added to the workflow history.

       WARNING:
          Only use this operation if the canceled flag of  a   RecordActivity-
          TaskHeartbeat request returns true and if the activity can be safely
          undone or abandoned.

       A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled  until  it
       is  closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is pro-
       cessing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a  call  to
       RespondActivityTaskCompleted , RespondActivityTaskCanceled,  RespondAc-
       tivityTaskFailed , or the task has timed out .
          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to  allow  or  deny  permission  to  call  this
         action.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside  the  specified  constraints,  the
       action  fails.  The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set
       to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            respond-activity-task-canceled
          --task-token <value>
          [--details <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-token (string)
          The taskToken of the  ActivityTask .

          WARNING:
              taskToken is generated by the service and should be  treated  as
              an  opaque  value. If the task is passed to another process, its
              taskToken must also be passed. This enables it  to  provide  its
              progress and respond with results.

       --details (string)
          Information about the cancellation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
