DESCRIBE-WORKFLOW-TYPE()                              DESCRIBE-WORKFLOW-TYPE()



NAME
       describe-workflow-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the specified workflow type . This includes
       configuration settings specified when the type was registered and other
       information such as creation date, current status, etc.
          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element  to  allow  or  deny permission to call this
         action.

       o Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element  with
         the appropriate keys.

         o workflowType.name  :  String  constraint.  The key is swf:workflow-
           Type.name .

         o workflowType.version : String constraint. The key is  swf:workflow-
           Type.version .

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside  the  specified  constraints,  the
       action  fails.  The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set
       to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-workflow-type
          --domain <value>
          --workflow-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain in which this workflow type is registered.

       --workflow-type (structure)
          The workflow type to describe.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the workflow type.

              NOTE:
                 The combination of workflow type name  and  version  must  be
                 unique with in a domain.

          version -> (string)
              The version of the workflow type.

              NOTE:
                 The  combination  of  workflow  type name and version must be
                 unique with in a domain.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       typeInfo -> (structure)
          General information about the workflow type.

          The status of the workflow type (returned  in  the  WorkflowTypeInfo
          structure) can be one of the following.

          o REGISTERED  The type is registered and available. Workers support-
            ing this type should be running.

          o DEPRECATED  The type was deprecated using  DeprecateWorkflowType ,
            but  is still in use. You should keep workers supporting this type
            running. You cannot create new workflow executions of this type.

          workflowType -> (structure)
              The workflow type this information is about.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the workflow type.

                 NOTE:
                     The combination of workflow type name and version must be
                     unique with in a domain.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of the workflow type.

                 NOTE:
                     The combination of workflow type name and version must be
                     unique with in a domain.

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the workflow type.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the type  registered  through   RegisterWork-
              flowType .

          creationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date when this type was registered.

          deprecationDate -> (timestamp)
              If  the  type is in deprecated state, then it is set to the date
              when the type was deprecated.

       configuration -> (structure)
          Configuration settings of the workflow type registered through  Reg-
          isterWorkflowType

          defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The  default  maximum  duration,  specified when registering the
              workflow type, that a decision task for executions of this work-
              flow  type might take before returning completion or failure. If
              the task doesn'tdo close in the specified time then the task  is
              automatically  timed out and rescheduled. If the decider eventu-
              ally reports a  completion  or  failure,  it  is  ignored.  This
              default  can  be  overridden  when starting a workflow execution
              using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the  StartChildWork-
              flowExecution   Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The default maximum duration,  specified  when  registering  the
              workflow  type,  for  executions  of  this  workflow  type. This
              default can be overridden when  starting  a  workflow  execution
              using  the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the StartChildWork-
              flowExecution   Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultTaskList -> (structure)
              The  default  task list, specified when registering the workflow
              type, for decisions tasks scheduled for workflow  executions  of
              this  type. This default can be overridden when starting a work-
              flow execution using the  StartWorkflowExecution action  or  the
              StartChildWorkflowExecution   Decision .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the task list.

          defaultTaskPriority -> (string)
              The  default task priority, specified when registering the work-
              flow type, for all decision tasks of this  workflow  type.  This
              default  can  be  overridden  when starting a workflow execution
              using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the  StartChildWork-
              flowExecution decision.

              Valid   values   are  integers  that  range  from  Java's  Inte-
              ger.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to  Integer.MAX_VALUE  (2147483647).
              Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

              For  more  information  about setting task priority, see Setting
              Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

          defaultChildPolicy -> (string)
              The default policy to use for the child workflow executions when
              a  workflow execution of this type is terminated, by calling the
              TerminateWorkflowExecution  action  explicitly  or  due  to   an
              expired  timeout. This default can be overridden when starting a
              workflow execution using the  StartWorkflowExecution  action  or
              the StartChildWorkflowExecution   Decision .

              The supported child policies are:

              o TERMINATE  The child executions are terminated.

              o REQUEST_CANCEL   A  request  to  cancel  is attempted for each
                child  execution  by  recording  a  WorkflowExecutionCancelRe-
                quested  event in its history. It is up to the decider to take
                appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with
                this event.

              o ABANDON   No action is taken. The child executions continue to
                run.

          defaultLambdaRole -> (string)
              The default IAM role attached to this workflow type.

              NOTE:
                 Executions of this workflow type need  IAM  roles  to  invoke
                 Lambda  functions.  If  you  don't  specify  an IAM role when
                 starting this workflow  type,  the  default  Lambda  role  is
                 attached   to   the  execution.  For  more  information,  see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html
                 in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .
