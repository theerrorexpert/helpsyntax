SIGNAL-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()                        SIGNAL-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()



NAME
       signal-workflow-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Records  a  WorkflowExecutionSignaled  event  in the workflow execution
       history and creates a decision task for the workflow execution  identi-
       fied  by  the given domain, workflowId and runId. The event is recorded
       with the specified user defined signalName and input (if provided).

       NOTE:
          If a runId isn't specified, then the WorkflowExecutionSignaled event
          is  recorded  in  the  history of the current open workflow with the
          matching workflowId in the domain.

       NOTE:
              If the specified workflow  execution  isn't  open,  this  method
              fails with UnknownResource .

          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element  to  allow  or  deny permission to call this
         action.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or  the  parameter  values  fall outside the specified constraints, the
       action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter  is  set
       to  OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and example IAM policies, see
       Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in  the  Amazon  SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            signal-workflow-execution
          --domain <value>
          --workflow-id <value>
          [--run-id <value>]
          --signal-name <value>
          [--input <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name of the domain containing the workflow execution to signal.

       --workflow-id (string)
          The workflowId of the workflow execution to signal.

       --run-id (string)
          The runId of the workflow execution to signal.

       --signal-name (string)
          The name of the signal. This name must be meaningful to  the  target
          workflow.

       --input (string)
          Data  to attach to the WorkflowExecutionSignaled event in the target
          workflow execution's history.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
