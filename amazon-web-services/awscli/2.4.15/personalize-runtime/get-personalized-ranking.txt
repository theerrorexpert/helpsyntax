SYNOPSIS
            get-personalized-ranking
          --campaign-arn <value>
          --input-list <value>
          --user-id <value>
          [--context <value>]
          [--filter-arn <value>]
          [--filter-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --campaign-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the campaign to use for generating
          the personalized ranking.

       --input-list (list)
          A list of items (by itemId ) to rank. If an item was not included in
          the training dataset, the  item  is  appended  to  the  end  of  the
          reranked list. The maximum is 500.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --user-id (string)
          The  user  for which you want the campaign to provide a personalized
          ranking.

       --context (map)
          The contextual metadata to use when getting recommendations. Contex-
          tual  metadata  includes  any  interaction information that might be
          relevant when getting a user's recommendations, such as  the  user's
          current location or device type.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --filter-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a filter you created to include
          items or exclude items from recommendations for a  given  user.  For
          more information, see Filtering Recommendations .

       --filter-values (map)
          The  values  to  use when filtering recommendations. For each place-
          holder parameter in your filter expression,  provide  the  parameter
          name (in matching case) as a key and the filter value(s) as the cor-
          responding value. Separate multiple values for one parameter with  a
          comma.

          For filter expressions that use an INCLUDE element to include items,
          you must provide values for all parameters that are defined  in  the
          expression. For filters with expressions that use an EXCLUDE element
          to exclude items, you can omit the filter-values .In this case, Ama-
          zon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter
          recommendations.

          For more information, see Filtering Recommendations .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       personalizedRanking -> (list)
          A list of items in order of most likely interest to  the  user.  The

          (structure)

              score -> (double)
                 A  numeric  representation  of the model's certainty that the
                 item will be the next user selection. For more information on
                 scoring logic, see  how-scores-work .
