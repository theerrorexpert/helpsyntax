SYNOPSIS
            get-assessment-report
          --assessment-run-arn <value>
          --report-file-format <value>
          --report-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-run-arn (string)
          The ARN that specifies the assessment run for which you want to gen-
          erate a report.

       --report-file-format (string)
          Specifies  the  file  format  (html or pdf) of the assessment report
          that you want to generate.

          Possible values:

          o HTML

          o PDF

       --report-type (string)
          Specifies the type of the assessment report that you want to  gener-
          ate. There are two types of assessment reports: a finding report and
          a full report. For more information, see Assessment Reports .

          Possible values:

          o FINDING

          o FULL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       status -> (string)
          Specifies the status  of  the  request  to  generate  an  assessment
          report.

       url -> (string)
          Specifies  the  URL  where  you  can  find  the generated assessment
          report. This parameter is only returned if the  report  is  success-
          fully generated.
