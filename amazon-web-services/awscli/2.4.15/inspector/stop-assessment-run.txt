STOP-ASSESSMENT-RUN()                                    STOP-ASSESSMENT-RUN()



NAME
       stop-assessment-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops the assessment run that is specified by the ARN of the assessment
       run.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-assessment-run
          --assessment-run-arn <value>
          [--stop-action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-run-arn (string)
          The ARN of the assessment run that you want to stop.

       --stop-action (string)
          An input option that  can  be  set  to  either  START_EVALUATION  or
          SKIP_EVALUATION. START_EVALUATION (the default value), stops the AWS
          agent from collecting data and begins the results evaluation and the
          findings  generation process. SKIP_EVALUATION cancels the assessment
          run immediately, after which no findings are generated.

          Possible values:

          o START_EVALUATION

          o SKIP_EVALUATION

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop an assessment run

       The following stop-assessment-run command stops the assessment run with
       the      ARN      of      arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:tar-
       get/0-nvgVhaxX/template/0-it5r2S4T/run/0-jOoroxyY:

          aws inspector stop-assessment-run --assessment-run-arn arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX/template/0-it5r2S4T/run/0-jOoroxyY
