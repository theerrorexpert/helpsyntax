DESCRIBE-RULES-PACKAGES()                            DESCRIBE-RULES-PACKAGES()



NAME
       describe-rules-packages -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  rules  packages  that  are specified by the ARNs of the
       rules packages.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-rules-packages
          --rules-package-arns <value>
          [--locale <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rules-package-arns (list)
          The ARN that specifies the rules package that you want to  describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --locale (string)
          The  locale  that  you want to translate a rules package description
          into.

          Possible values:

          o EN_US

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe rules packages

       The following describe-rules-packages command describes the rules pack-
       age with the ARN of arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:758058086616:rulespack-
       age/0-9hgA516p:

          aws inspector describe-rules-packages --rules-package-arns arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:758058086616:rulespackage/0-9hgA516p

       Output:
