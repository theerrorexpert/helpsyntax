DESCRIBE-ASSESSMENT-TARGETS()                    DESCRIBE-ASSESSMENT-TARGETS()



NAME
       describe-assessment-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the assessment targets that are specified by the ARNs of the
       assessment targets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-assessment-targets
          --assessment-target-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-target-arns (list)
          The ARNs that specifies the assessment  targets  that  you  want  to
          describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe assessment targets

       The following describe-assessment-targets command describes the assess-
       ment     target     with      the      ARN      of      arn:aws:inspec-
       tor:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq:

          aws inspector describe-assessment-targets --assessment-target-arns arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq

       Output:

          {
                "assessmentTargets": [
                  {
                        "arn": "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq",
