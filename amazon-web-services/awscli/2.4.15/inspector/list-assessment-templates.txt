LIST-ASSESSMENT-TEMPLATES()                        LIST-ASSESSMENT-TEMPLATES()



NAME
       list-assessment-templates -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  assessment templates that correspond to the assessment tar-
       gets that are specified by the ARNs of the assessment targets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-assessment-templates is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: assessmentTemplateArns

SYNOPSIS
            list-assessment-templates
          [--assessment-target-arns <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-target-arns (list)
          A  list  of ARNs that specifies the assessment targets whose assess-
          ment templates you want to list.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filter (structure)
          You can use this parameter  to  specify  a  subset  of  data  to  be
          included in the action's response.

          For a record to match a filter, all specified filter attributes must
          match. When multiple values are specified for  a  filter  attribute,
          any of the values can match.

          namePattern -> (string)
              For  a  record  to match a filter, an explicit value or a string
              that contains a wildcard that is specified for  this  data  type
              property  must  match  the  value  of the assessmentTemplateName
              property of the  AssessmentTemplate data type.

          durationRange -> (structure)
              For a record to match a filter, the  value  specified  for  this
              data  type property must inclusively match any value between the
              specified minimum and maximum values  of  the  durationInSeconds
              property of the  AssessmentTemplate data type.

              minSeconds -> (integer)
                 The minimum value of the duration range. Must be greater than
                 zero.

              maxSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum value of the duration range. Must be less than or
                 equal to 604800 seconds (1 week).

          rulesPackageArns -> (list)
              For  a  record  to match a filter, the values that are specified
              for this data type property must be contained  in  the  list  of
              values  of  the rulesPackageArns property of the  AssessmentTem-
              plate data type.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          namePattern=string,durationRange={minSeconds=integer,maxSeconds=integer},rulesPackageArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "namePattern": "string",
            "durationRange": {
              "minSeconds": integer,
              "maxSeconds": integer
            },
            "rulesPackageArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list assessment templates

       The  following  list-assessment-templates  command  lists  all existing
       assessment templates:

          aws inspector list-assessment-templates

       Output:

          {
                 "assessmentTemplateArns": [
                 "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq/template/0-4r1V2mAw",
                 "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq/template/0-Uza6ihLh"
                 ]
          }

       For more information, see Amazon  Inspector  Assessment  Templates  and
       Assessment Runs in the Amazon Inspector guide.

OUTPUT
       assessmentTemplateArns -> (list)
          A  list  of ARNs that specifies the assessment templates returned by
          the action.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          When a response is generated, if there is more data  to  be  listed,
          this  parameter is present in the response and contains the value to
          use for the nextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination  request.
          If  there  is  no  more  data to be listed, this parameter is set to
          null.
