CREATE-ASSESSMENT-TARGET()                          CREATE-ASSESSMENT-TARGET()



NAME
       create-assessment-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  assessment  target using the ARN of the resource group
       that is generated by  CreateResourceGroup . If resourceGroupArn is  not
       specified,  all EC2 instances in the current AWS account and region are
       included in the assessment target.  If  the  service-linked  role  isnt
       already  registered,  this  action  also  creates  and registers a ser-
       vice-linked role to grant  Amazon  Inspector  access  to  AWS  Services
       needed to perform security assessments. You can create up to 50 assess-
       ment targets per AWS account. You can run up to 500  concurrent  agents
       per  AWS account. For more information, see Amazon Inspector Assessment
       Targets .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-assessment-target
          --assessment-target-name <value>
          [--resource-group-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-target-name (string)
          The user-defined name that identifies the assessment target that you
          want to create. The name must be unique within the AWS account.

       --resource-group-arn (string)
          The ARN that specifies the resource group that is used to create the
          assessment target. If resourceGroupArn is  not  specified,  all  EC2
          instances  in the current AWS account and region are included in the
          assessment target.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an assessment target

       The following create-assessment-target command  creates  an  assessment
       target  named ExampleAssessmentTarget using the resource group with the
       ARN        of        arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-
       group/0-AB6DMKnv:

          aws inspector create-assessment-target --assessment-target-name ExampleAssessmentTarget --resource-group-arn arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-AB6DMKnv

       Output:

          {
              "assessmentTargetArn": "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Amazon Inspector Assessment Targets in the
       Amazon Inspector guide.

OUTPUT
       assessmentTargetArn -> (string)
          The ARN that specifies the assessment target that is created.
