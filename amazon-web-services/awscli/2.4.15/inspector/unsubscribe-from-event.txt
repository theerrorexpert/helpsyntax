DESCRIPTION

       (SNS) notifications about a specified event to a specified SNS topic.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            unsubscribe-from-event
          --resource-arn <value>
          --event <value>
          --topic-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the assessment template that is used during the event for
          which you want to stop receiving SNS notifications.

       --event (string)
          The event for which you want to stop receiving SNS notifications.

          Possible values:

          o ASSESSMENT_RUN_STARTED

          o ASSESSMENT_RUN_COMPLETED

          o ASSESSMENT_RUN_STATE_CHANGED

          o FINDING_REPORTED

          o OTHER

       --topic-arn (string)
          The ARN of the SNS topic to which SNS notifications are sent.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
