LIST-FINDINGS()                                                LIST-FINDINGS()



NAME
       list-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists findings that are generated by the assessment runs that are spec-
       ified by the ARNs of the assessment runs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-findings is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: findingArns

OPTIONS
       --assessment-run-arns (list)
          The  ARNs of the assessment runs that generate the findings that you
          want to list.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filter (structure)
          You can use this parameter  to  specify  a  subset  of  data  to  be
          included in the action's response.

          For a record to match a filter, all specified filter attributes must
          match. When multiple values are specified for  a  filter  attribute,
          any of the values can match.

          agentIds -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied for this data type property must be the exact match of  the
              value of the agentId property of the  Finding data type.

              (string)

          autoScalingGroups -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied for this data type property must be the exact match of  the
              value  of  the  autoScalingGroup  property  of the  Finding data
              type.

              (string)

          ruleNames -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied  for this data type property must be the exact match of the
              value of the ruleName property of the  Finding data type.

              (string)

          severities -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied  for this data type property must be the exact match of the
              value of the severity property of the  Finding data type.

              (string)

          rulesPackageArns -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied  for this data type property must be the exact match of the
              value of the rulesPackageArn property of the  Finding data type.

              (string)

          attributes -> (list)
              For  a  record  to  match  a filter, the list of values that are
              specified for this data type property must be contained  in  the
              list  of  values of the attributes property of the  Finding data
              type.

              (structure)
                 This data type is used as a request parameter in the   AddAt-
                 tributesToFindings and  CreateAssessmentTemplate actions.

                 key -> (string)
                     The attribute key.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value assigned to the attribute key.

          userAttributes -> (list)
              For  a record to match a filter, the value that is specified for
              this data type property must be contained in the list of  values
              of the userAttributes property of the  Finding data type.

              (structure)
                 This  data type is used as a request parameter in the  AddAt-
                 tributesToFindings and  CreateAssessmentTemplate actions.

                 key -> (string)
                     The attribute key.

                 value -> (string)

          creationTimeRange -> (structure)
              The time range during which the finding is generated.

              beginDate -> (timestamp)
                 The minimum value of the timestamp range.

              endDate -> (timestamp)
                 The maximum value of the timestamp range.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          agentIds=string,string,autoScalingGroups=string,string,ruleNames=string,string,severities=string,string,rulesPackageArns=string,string,attributes=[{key=string,value=string},{key=string,value=string}],userAttributes=[{key=string,value=string},{key=string,value=string}],creationTimeRange={beginDate=timestamp,endDate=timestamp}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "agentIds": ["string", ...],
            "autoScalingGroups": ["string", ...],
            "ruleNames": ["string", ...],
            "severities": ["Low"|"Medium"|"High"|"Informational"|"Undefined", ...],
            "rulesPackageArns": ["string", ...],
            "attributes": [
              {
                "key": "string",
                "value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "userAttributes": [
              {
                "key": "string",
                "value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "creationTimeRange": {
              "beginDate": timestamp,
              "endDate": timestamp
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list findings

       The  following  list-findings  command lists all of the generated find-
       ings:

          aws inspector list-findings

       Output:

          {
                  "findingArns": [
                  "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq/template/0-4r1V2mAw/run/0-MKkpXXPE/finding/0-HwPnsDm4",
                  "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq/template/0-4r1V2mAw/run/0-v5D6fI3v/finding/0-tyvmqBLy"
                ]
          }

       Inspector guide.

OUTPUT
       findingArns -> (list)
          A list of ARNs that specifies the findings returned by the action.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          When  a  response  is generated, if there is more data to be listed,
          this parameter is present in the response and contains the value  to
          use  for the nextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
          If there is no more data to be listed,  this  parameter  is  set  to
          null.
