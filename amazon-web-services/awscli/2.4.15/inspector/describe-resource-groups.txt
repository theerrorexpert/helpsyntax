DESCRIBE-RESOURCE-GROUPS()                          DESCRIBE-RESOURCE-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-resource-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  resource  groups  that are specified by the ARNs of the
       resource groups.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-resource-groups
          --resource-group-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-group-arns (list)
          The ARN that specifies the resource group that you want to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe resource groups

       The  following  describe-resource-groups command describes the resource
       group       with        the        ARN        of        arn:aws:inspec-
       tor:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-PyGXopAI:

          aws inspector describe-resource-groups --resource-group-arns arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-PyGXopAI

       Output:

          {
                "failedItems": {},
                "resourceGroups": [
                  {
                        "arn": "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-PyGXopAI",
                        "createdAt": 1458074191.098,
                        "tags": [
                          {
                                "key": "Name",
                                "value": "example"
                          }
                        ]
                  }
                ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceGroups -> (list)
          Information about a resource group.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a resource group. The resource  group
              defines  a  set  of  tags  that,  when queried, identify the AWS
              resources that make up the assessment target. This data type  is
              used  as  the  response  element  in the  DescribeResourceGroups
              action.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource group.

              tags -> (list)
                 The tags (key and value pairs) of the  resource  group.  This
                 data  type  property  is  used  in  the   CreateResourceGroup
                 action.

                 (structure)
                     This data type is used as one  of  the  elements  of  the
                     ResourceGroup data type.

                     key -> (string)
                        A tag key.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value assigned to a tag key.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which resource group is created.

       failedItems -> (map)
          Resource  group  details  that cannot be described. An error code is
          provided for each failed item.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Includes details about the failed items.

              failureCode -> (string)
                 The status code of a failed item.

              retryable -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether you can immediately  retry  a  request  for
                 this item for a specified resource.
