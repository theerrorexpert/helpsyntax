NAME
       describe-reservation -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays the details of a reservation. The response includes the reser-
       vation name, state, start date and time, and the details of the  offer-
       ing  that make up the rest of the reservation (such as price, duration,
       and outbound bandwidth).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-reservation
          --reservation-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reservation-arn (string) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the reser-
       vation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Reservation -> (structure)
          A  pricing  agreement  for a discounted rate for a specific outbound
          bandwidth that your MediaConnect account will use each month over  a
          specific time period. The discounted rate in the reservation applies
          to outbound bandwidth for all flows from  your  account  until  your
          account  reaches the amount of bandwidth in your reservation. If you
          use more outbound bandwidth than the agreed upon amount in a  single
          month, the overage is charged at the on-demand rate.

          CurrencyCode -> (string)

              used for your reservation is US dollars.
