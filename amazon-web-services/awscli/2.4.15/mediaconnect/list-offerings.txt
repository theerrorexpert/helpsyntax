LIST-OFFERINGS()                                              LIST-OFFERINGS()



NAME
       list-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  a list of all offerings that are available to this account in
       the current AWS Region. If you have an active reservation (which  means
       you've  purchased  an  offering  that  has  already  started and hasn't
       expired yet), your account isn't eligible for other offerings.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-offerings is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Offerings

SYNOPSIS
            list-offerings
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that identifies which batch of results that  you  want  to
          see. For example, you submit a ListOfferings request with MaxResults
          set at 5. The service returns the first batch of results (up  to  5)
          and  a  NextToken  value.  To see the next batch of results, you can
          submit the ListOfferings request a second time and specify the Next-
          Token value.

       Offerings -> (list)
          A  list  of offerings that are available to this account in the cur-
          rent AWS Region.

          (structure)
              A savings plan that reserves a certain amount of outbound  band-
              width  usage  at  a  discounted rate each month over a period of
              time.

              CurrencyCode -> (string)
                 The type of currency that is used for billing. The  currency-
                 Code used for all reservations is US dollars.

              Duration -> (integer)
                 The length of time that your reservation would be active.

              DurationUnits -> (string)
                 The unit of measurement for the duration of the offering.

              OfferingArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that MediaConnect assigns to
                 the offering.

              OfferingDescription -> (string)
                 A description of the offering.

              PricePerUnit -> (string)
                 The cost of a single unit. This value,  in  combination  with
                 priceUnits, makes up the rate.

              PriceUnits -> (string)
                 The unit of measurement that is used for billing. This value,
                 in combination with pricePerUnit, makes up the rate.

              ResourceSpecification -> (structure)
                 A definition of the amount of  outbound  bandwidth  that  you
                 would be reserving if you purchase the offering.

                 ReservedBitrate -> (integer)
                     The  amount  of  outbound bandwidth that is discounted in
                     the offering.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     The type of resource and the unit that  is  being  billed
                     for.
