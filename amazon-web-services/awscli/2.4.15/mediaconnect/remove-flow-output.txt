REMOVE-FLOW-OUTPUT()                                      REMOVE-FLOW-OUTPUT()



NAME
       remove-flow-output -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  an output from an existing flow. This request can be made only
       on an output that does not have an entitlement associated with  it.  If
       the output has an entitlement, you must revoke the entitlement instead.
       When an entitlement is revoked from a flow, the  service  automatically
       removes the associated output.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            remove-flow-output
          --flow-arn <value>
          --output-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --flow-arn (string) The flow that you want to remove an output from.

       --output-arn (string) The ARN of the output that you want to remove.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To remove an output from a flow

       The  following  remove-flow-output  example  removes an output from the
       specified flow.

          aws mediaconnect remove-flow-output \
              --flow-arn arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:flow:1-23aBC45dEF67hiJ8-12AbC34DE5fG:BaseballGame \
              --output-arn arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:output:2-3aBC45dEF67hiJ89-c34de5fG678h:NYC

       Output:

          {
              "FlowArn": "arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:flow:1-23aBC45dEF67hiJ8-12AbC34DE5fG:BaseballGame",
              "OutputArn": "arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:output:2-3aBC45dEF67hiJ89-c34de5fG678h:NYC"
          }
