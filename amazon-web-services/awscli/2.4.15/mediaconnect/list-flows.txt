LIST-FLOWS()                                                      LIST-FLOWS()



NAME
       list-flows -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  a  list  of flows that are associated with this account. This
       request returns a paginated result.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-flows is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Flows

SYNOPSIS
            list-flows
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a list of flows

       The following list-flows example displays a list of flows.

          aws mediaconnect list-flows

       Output:

          {
              "Flows": [

OUTPUT
       Flows -> (list)
          A list of flow summaries.

          (structure)
              Provides  a  summary  of a flow, including its ARN, Availability
              Zone, and source type.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone that the flow was created in.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the flow.

              FlowArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the flow.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the flow.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 The type of source. This value is  either  owned  (originated
                 somewhere other than an AWS Elemental MediaConnect flow owned
                 by another AWS account) or entitled  (originated  at  an  AWS
                 Elemental MediaConnect flow owned by another AWS account).

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the flow.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  identifies which batch of results that you want to
          see. For example, you submit a ListFlows request with MaxResults set
          at 5. The service returns the first batch of results (up to 5) and a
          NextToken value. To see the next batch of results,  you  can  submit
          the ListFlows request a second time and specify the NextToken value.
