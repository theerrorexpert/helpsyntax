SYNOPSIS
            grant-flow-entitlements
          --entitlements <value>

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entitlements  (list)  The  list  of  entitlements  that  you  want to
       grant.(structure)
          The entitlements that you want to grant on a flow.

          DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent -> (integer)
              Percentage from 0-100 of the data transfer cost to be billed  to
              the subscriber.

          Description -> (string)
              A  description of the entitlement. This description appears only
              on the AWS Elemental MediaConnect console and will not  be  seen
              by the subscriber or end user.

          Encryption -> (structure)
              The  type  of encryption that will be used on the output that is
              associated with this entitlement.

              Algorithm -> (string)
                 The type of algorithm that is used for the  encryption  (such
                 as aes128, aes192, or aes256).

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 A  128-bit,  16-byte  hex value represented by a 32-character
                 string, to be used with the key for encrypting content.  This
                 parameter is not valid for static key encryption.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The value of one of the devices that you configured with your
                 digital rights management (DRM) platform key  provider.  This
                 parameter  is  required for SPEKE encryption and is not valid
                 for static key encryption.

              KeyType -> (string)
                 The type of key that is used for the encryption. If  no  key-
                 Type  is  provided,  the service will use the default setting
                 (static-key).

              Region -> (string)
                 The AWS Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint  was  cre-
                 ated  in. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryption and
                 is not valid for static key encryption.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 An identifier for the content. The service sends  this  value
                 to  the  key  server  to  identify  the current endpoint. The
                 resource ID is also known as the content ID.  This  parameter
                 is  required for SPEKE encryption and is not valid for static
                 key encryption.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the role that you created during setup  (when  you
                 set up AWS Elemental MediaConnect as a trusted entity).

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the secret that you created in AWS Secrets Manager
                 to store the encryption key. This parameter is  required  for
                 static  key encryption and is not valid for SPEKE encryption.

              Url -> (string)
                 The URL from the API Gateway proxy that you set up to talk to
                 your key server. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryp-
                 tion and is not valid for static key encryption.

          EntitlementStatus -> (string)
              An indication of whether the new entitlement should  be  enabled
              or  disabled  as  soon as it is created. If you dont specify the
              entitlementStatus field in your request, MediaConnect sets it to
              ENABLED.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of  the entitlement. This value must be unique within
              the current flow.

          Subscribers -> (list)
              The AWS account IDs that you want to share  your  content  with.
              The  receiving  accounts (subscribers) will be allowed to create
              their own flows using your content as the source.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent=integer,Description=string,Encryption={Algorithm=string,ConstantInitializationVector=string,DeviceId=string,KeyType=string,Region=string,ResourceId=string,RoleArn=string,SecretArn=string,Url=string},EntitlementStatus=string,Name=string,Subscribers=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent": integer,
              "Description": "string",
              "Encryption": {
                "Algorithm": "aes128"|"aes192"|"aes256",
                "ConstantInitializationVector": "string",
                "DeviceId": "string",
                "KeyType": "speke"|"static-key"|"srt-password",
                "Region": "string",
                "ResourceId": "string",
                "RoleArn": "string",
                "SecretArn": "string",
                "Url": "string"
              },
              "EntitlementStatus": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED",
              "Name": "string",
              "Subscribers": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --flow-arn (string) The flow that you want to grant entitlements on.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
