       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                            to establish a  connection  with  the  flow.  This
                            value is represented by the elastic network inter-
                            face IP address of the  VPC.  This  field  applies
                            only  to  outputs that use the CDI or ST 2110 JPEG
                            XS protocol.

                 EncodingName -> (string)
                     The format that was used to encode the data.  For  ancil-
                     lary data streams, set the encoding name to smpte291. For
                     audio streams, set the encoding name to pcm.  For  video,
                     2110  streams,  set  the encoding name to raw. For video,
                     JPEG XS streams, set the encoding name to jxsv.

                 EncodingParameters -> (structure)
                     Encoding parameters

                     CompressionFactor -> (double)
                        A value that is used to calculate compression  for  an
                        output.  The  bitrate  of  the output is calculated as
                        follows: Output bitrate = (1  /  compressionFactor)  *
                        (source bitrate) This property only applies to outputs
                        that use the ST 2110 JPEG XS  protocol,  with  a  flow
                        source  that  uses  the CDI protocol. Valid values are
                        floating point numbers in the range of  3.0  to  10.0,
                        inclusive.

                     EncoderProfile -> (string)
                        A  setting on the encoder that drives compression set-
                        tings. This  property  only  applies  to  video  media
                        streams  associated  with outputs that use the ST 2110
                        JPEG XS protocol, with a flow source that uses the CDI
                        protocol.

                 MediaStreamName -> (string)
                     The name of the media stream.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  output. This value must be unique within the
              current flow.

          OutputArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the output.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port to use when content is distributed to this output.

          Transport -> (structure)
              Attributes related to the transport stream that are used in  the
              output.

              CidrAllowList -> (list)
                 The  range of IP addresses that should be allowed to initiate
                 output requests to this flow. These IP addresses should be in
                 the  form  of  a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block;
                 for example, 10.0.0.0/16.

                 (string)

              MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                 The smoothing max bitrate for RIST, RTP, and RTP-FEC streams.

              MaxLatency -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  latency in milliseconds. This parameter applies
                 only to RIST-based, Zixi-based, and Fujitsu-based streams.

              MaxSyncBuffer -> (integer)
                 The size of the buffer  (in  milliseconds)  to  use  to  sync
                 incoming source data.

              MinLatency -> (integer)
                 The minimum latency in milliseconds for SRT-based streams. In
                 streams that use the SRT protocol, this value that you set on
                 your  MediaConnect  source  or  output represents the minimal
                 potential latency of that  connection.  The  latency  of  the
                 stream is set to the highest number between the senders mini-
                 mum latency and the receivers minimum latency.

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The protocol that is used by the source or output.

              RemoteId -> (string)
                 The remote ID for the Zixi-pull stream.

              SenderControlPort -> (integer)
                 The port that the flow uses to send outbound requests to ini-
                 tiate connection with the sender.

              SenderIpAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP  address  that the flow communicates with to initiate
                 connection with the sender.

              SmoothingLatency -> (integer)
                 The smoothing latency in  milliseconds  for  RIST,  RTP,  and
                 RTP-FEC streams.

              StreamId -> (string)
                 The  stream  ID that you want to use for this transport. This
                 parameter applies only to Zixi-based streams.

          VpcInterfaceAttachment -> (structure)
              The name of the VPC interface attachment to use for this output.

              VpcInterfaceName -> (string)
