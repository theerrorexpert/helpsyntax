OPTIONS
       --decryption  (structure)  The  type  of encryption used on the content
       ingested from this source.Algorithm -> (string)
              The type of algorithm that is used for the encryption  (such  as
              aes128, aes192, or aes256).

          ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
              A  128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value  represented  by a 32-character
              string, to be used with the key  for  encrypting  content.  This
              parameter is not valid for static key encryption.

          DeviceId -> (string)
              The  value  of  one of the devices that you configured with your
              digital rights management  (DRM)  platform  key  provider.  This
              parameter  is required for SPEKE encryption and is not valid for
              static key encryption.

          KeyType -> (string)
              The type of key that is used for the encryption. If  no  keyType
              is   provided,   the   service  will  use  the  default  setting
              (static-key).

          Region -> (string)
              The AWS Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint  was  created
              in.  This  parameter is required for SPEKE encryption and is not
              valid for static key encryption.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              An identifier for the content. The service sends this  value  to
              the key server to identify the current endpoint. The resource ID
              is also known as the content ID. This parameter is required  for
              SPEKE encryption and is not valid for static key encryption.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the role that you created during setup (when you set
              up AWS Elemental MediaConnect as a trusted entity).

          SecretArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the secret that you created in AWS Secrets Manager to
              store  the encryption key. This parameter is required for static
              key encryption and is not valid for SPEKE encryption.

          Url -> (string)
              The URL from the API Gateway proxy that you set up  to  talk  to
              your key server. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryption
              and is not valid for static key encryption.

       this source.

       --whitelist-cidr (string) The range of  IP  addresses  that  should  be
       allowed to contribute content to your source. These IP addresses should
       be in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing  (CIDR)  block;  for
       example, 10.0.0.0/16.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                 incoming source data.

              MinLatency -> (integer)
                 The minimum latency in milliseconds for SRT-based streams. In
                 streams that use the SRT protocol, this value that you set on
                 your  MediaConnect  source  or  output represents the minimal
                 potential latency of that  connection.  The  latency  of  the
                 stream is set to the highest number between the senders mini-
                 mum latency and the receivers minimum latency.

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The protocol that is used by the source or output.

              RemoteId -> (string)
                 The remote ID for the Zixi-pull stream.

              SenderControlPort -> (integer)
                 The port that the flow uses to send outbound requests to ini-
                 tiate connection with the sender.

              SenderIpAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP  address  that the flow communicates with to initiate
                 connection with the sender.

              SmoothingLatency -> (integer)
                 The smoothing latency in  milliseconds  for  RIST,  RTP,  and
                 RTP-FEC streams.

              StreamId -> (string)
                 The  stream  ID that you want to use for this transport. This
                 parameter applies only to Zixi-based streams.

          VpcInterfaceName -> (string)
              The name of the VPC interface that is used for this source.

          WhitelistCidr -> (string)
              The range of IP addresses that should be allowed  to  contribute
              content to your source. These IP addresses should be in the form
              of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block;  for  example,
              10.0.0.0/16.
