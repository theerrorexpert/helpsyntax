OPTIONS
       --flow-arn (string) The flow that you want to mutate.

       --sources (list) A list of sources that you want to add.(structure)
          The settings for the source of the flow.

          Decryption -> (structure)
              The type of encryption that is used on the content ingested from
              this source.

              Algorithm -> (string)
                 The type of algorithm that is used for the  encryption  (such
                 as aes128, aes192, or aes256).

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 A  128-bit,  16-byte  hex value represented by a 32-character
                 string, to be used with the key for encrypting content.  This
                 parameter is not valid for static key encryption.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The value of one of the devices that you configured with your
                 digital rights management (DRM) platform key  provider.  This
                 parameter  is  required for SPEKE encryption and is not valid
                 for static key encryption.

              KeyType -> (string)
                 The type of key that is used for the encryption. If  no  key-
                 Type  is  provided,  the service will use the default setting
                 (static-key).

              Region -> (string)
                 The AWS Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint  was  cre-
                 ated  in. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryption and
                 is not valid for static key encryption.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 An identifier for the content. The service sends  this  value
                 to  the  key  server  to  identify  the current endpoint. The
                 resource ID is also known as the content ID.  This  parameter
                 is  required for SPEKE encryption and is not valid for static
                 key encryption.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the role that you created during setup  (when  you
                 set up AWS Elemental MediaConnect as a trusted entity).

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the secret that you created in AWS Secrets Manager
                 to store the encryption key. This parameter is  required  for
                 static  key encryption and is not valid for SPEKE encryption.

              Url -> (string)
                 The URL from the API Gateway proxy that you set up to talk to
                 your key server. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryp-
                 tion and is not valid for static key encryption.

          Description -> (string)
              A description for the source. This value is  not  used  or  seen
              outside of the current AWS Elemental MediaConnect account.

          EntitlementArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the entitlement that allows you to subscribe to this
              flow. The entitlement is set by the flow originator, and the ARN
              is generated as part of the originator's flow.

          IngestPort -> (integer)

              The minimum latency in milliseconds for  SRT-based  streams.  In
              streams  that  use  the SRT protocol, this value that you set on
              your MediaConnect source or output represents the minimal poten-

              The range of IP addresses that should be allowed  to  contribute
              content to your source. These IP addresses should be in the form
              of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block;  for  example,

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 the source.

                 CidrAllowList -> (list)
                     The  range of IP addresses that should be allowed to ini-
                     tiate output requests to this flow.  These  IP  addresses
                     should be in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing
                     (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16.

                     (string)

                 MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                     The smoothing max bitrate  for  RIST,  RTP,  and  RTP-FEC
                     streams.

                 MaxLatency -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  latency  in  milliseconds.  This  parameter
                     applies only to RIST-based, Zixi-based, and Fujitsu-based
                     streams.

                 MaxSyncBuffer -> (integer)
                     The  size  of the buffer (in milliseconds) to use to sync
                     incoming source data.

                 MinLatency -> (integer)
                     The  minimum  latency  in  milliseconds   for   SRT-based
                     streams. In streams that use the SRT protocol, this value
                     that you set on your MediaConnect source or output repre-
                     sents  the  minimal potential latency of that connection.
                     The latency of the stream is set to  the  highest  number
                     between  the  senders  minimum  latency and the receivers
                     minimum latency.

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     The protocol that is used by the source or output.

                 RemoteId -> (string)
                     The remote ID for the Zixi-pull stream.

                 SenderControlPort -> (integer)
                     The port that the flow uses to send outbound requests  to
                     initiate connection with the sender.

                 SenderIpAddress -> (string)
                     The  IP address that the flow communicates with to initi-
                     ate connection with the sender.

                 SmoothingLatency -> (integer)
                     The smoothing latency in milliseconds for RIST, RTP,  and
                     RTP-FEC streams.

                 StreamId -> (string)
                     The  stream  ID  that you want to use for this transport.
                     This parameter applies only to Zixi-based streams.

              VpcInterfaceName -> (string)
                 The name of the VPC interface that is used for this source.

              WhitelistCidr -> (string)
                 The range of IP addresses that should be allowed to  contrib-
                 ute  content  to your source. These IP addresses should be in
                 the form of a Classless Inter-Domain  Routing  (CIDR)  block;
                 for example, 10.0.0.0/16.
