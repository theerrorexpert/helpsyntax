NAME
       add-flow-vpc-interfaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds VPC interfaces to flow

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-flow-vpc-interfaces
          --flow-arn <value>
          --vpc-interfaces <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --flow-arn (string) The flow that you want to mutate.

       --vpc-interfaces  (list)  A  list  of  VPC  interfaces that you want to
       add.(structure)
          Desired VPC Interface for a Flow

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the VPC Interface. This value must be unique  within
              the current flow.

          NetworkInterfaceType -> (string)
              The  type of network interface. If this value is not included in
              the request, MediaConnect uses ENA as the  networkInterfaceType.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              Role  Arn  MediaConnect can assumes to create ENIs in customer's
              account

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              Security Group IDs to be used on ENI.

              (string)

          SubnetId -> (string)
              Subnet must be in the AZ of the Flow

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,NetworkInterfaceType=string,RoleArn=string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string,SubnetId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "NetworkInterfaceType": "ena"|"efa",
              "RoleArn": "string",
              "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
              "SubnetId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FlowArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the flow that these VPC interfaces were added to.

       VpcInterfaces -> (list)
          The details of the newly added VPC interfaces.

          (structure)
              The settings for a VPC Source.

              Name -> (string)
                 Immutable and has to be a unique against other  VpcInterfaces
                 in this Flow.

              NetworkInterfaceIds -> (list)
                 IDs  of  the network interfaces created in customer's account
                 by MediaConnect.

                 (string)

              NetworkInterfaceType -> (string)

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 Role Arn MediaConnect can assumes  to  create  ENIs  in  cus-
                 tomer's account

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 Security Group IDs to be used on ENI.

                 (string)
