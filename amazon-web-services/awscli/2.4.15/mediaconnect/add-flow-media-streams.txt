ADD-FLOW-MEDIA-STREAMS()                              ADD-FLOW-MEDIA-STREAMS()



NAME
       add-flow-media-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds media streams to an existing flow. After you add a media stream to
       a flow, you can associate it with a source and/or an output  that  uses
       the ST 2110 JPEG XS or CDI protocol.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-flow-media-streams
          --flow-arn <value>
          --media-streams <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --flow-arn (string) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow.

       --media-streams  (list)  The  media streams that you want to add to the
       flow.(structure)
          The media stream that you want to add to the flow.

          Attributes -> (structure)
              The attributes that you want to assign to the new media  stream.

              Fmtp -> (structure)
                 The settings that you want to use to define the media stream.

                 ChannelOrder -> (string)
                     The format of the audio channel.

                 Colorimetry -> (string)
                     The format that is used for the representation of  color.

                 ExactFramerate -> (string)
                     The  frame  rate  for the video stream, in frames/second.
                     For example: 60000/1001. If you specify a  whole  number,
                     MediaConnect  uses  a  ratio  of N/1. For example, if you
                     specify 60, MediaConnect uses 60/1 as the exactFramerate.

                 Par -> (string)
                     The pixel aspect ratio (PAR) of the video.

                 Range -> (string)
                     The encoding range of the video.

                 ScanMode -> (string)
                     The  type  of  compression  that  was  used to smooth the
                     videos appearance.

                 Tcs -> (string)
                     The transfer characteristic system (TCS) that is used  in
                     the video.

              Lang -> (string)
                 The  audio  language,  in  a format that is recognized by the
                 receiver.

          ClockRate -> (integer)
              The sample rate (in Hz) for the stream. If the media stream type
              is  video  or  ancillary  data,  set this value to 90000. If the
              media stream type is audio, set this value to  either  48000  or
              96000.

          Description -> (string)
              A description that can help you quickly identify what your media
              stream is used for.

              A name that helps you distinguish one media stream from another.

          MediaStreamType -> (string)
              The type of media stream.

          VideoFormat -> (string)
              The resolution of the video.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FlowArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the flow that you added media streams to.

       MediaStreams -> (list)

          (structure)
              A single track or stream of media that contains video, audio, or
              ancillary data. After you add a media stream to a flow, you  can
              associate  it  with sources and outputs on that flow, as long as
              they use the CDI protocol or the ST 2110 JPEG XS protocol.  Each
              source or output can consist of one or many media streams.

              Attributes -> (structure)
                 Attributes that are related to the media stream.

                 Fmtp -> (structure)
                     A set of parameters that define the media stream.

                     ChannelOrder -> (string)
                        The format of the audio channel.

                     Colorimetry -> (string)
                        The  format  that  is  used  for the representation of
                        color.

                     ExactFramerate -> (string)
                        The frame rate for the video stream, in frames/second.
                        For  example:  60000/1001. If you specify a whole num-
                        ber, MediaConnect uses a ratio of N/1. For example, if
                        you  specify  60, MediaConnect uses 60/1 as the exact-
                        Framerate.

                     Par -> (string)
                        The pixel aspect ratio (PAR) of the video.

                     Range -> (string)
                        The encoding range of the video.

                     ScanMode -> (string)
                        The type of compression that was used  to  smooth  the
                        videos appearance

                     Tcs -> (string)
                        The  transfer characteristic system (TCS) that is used
                        in the video.

                 Lang -> (string)
                     The audio language, in a format that is recognized by the
                     receiver.

              ClockRate -> (integer)
                 The sample rate for the stream. This value is measured in Hz.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description that can help you quickly  identify  what  your

                 The  format type number (sometimes referred to as RTP payload
                 type) of the media stream. MediaConnect assigns this value to
                 the  media  stream.  For ST 2110 JPEG XS outputs, you need to
                 provide this value to the receiver.

              MediaStreamId -> (integer)
                 A unique identifier for the media stream.

                 another.

              MediaStreamType -> (string)
                 The type of media stream.

              VideoFormat -> (string)
                 The resolution of the video.
