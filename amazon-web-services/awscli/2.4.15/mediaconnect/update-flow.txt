DESCRIPTION
       Updates flow

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-flow
          --flow-arn <value>
          [--source-failover-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --flow-arn (string) The flow that you want to update.

       --source-failover-config    (structure)   The   settings   for   source
       failover.FailoverMode -> (string)
              The type of failover you choose for this  flow.  MERGE  combines
              the  source  streams  into  a  single  stream, allowing graceful
              recovery from any single-source loss. FAILOVER allows  switching
              between different streams.

          RecoveryWindow -> (integer)
              Recovery window time to look for dash-7 packets

          SourcePriority -> (structure)
              The priority you want to assign to a source. You can have a pri-
              mary stream and a  backup  stream  or  two  equally  prioritized
              streams.

              PrimarySource -> (string)
                 The  name  of the source you choose as the primary source for
                 this flow.

          State -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FailoverMode=string,RecoveryWindow=integer,SourcePriority={PrimarySource=string},State=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FailoverMode": "MERGE"|"FAILOVER",
            "RecoveryWindow": integer,
            "SourcePriority": {
              "PrimarySource": "string"
            },
            "State": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     KeyType -> (string)
                        The type of key that is used for the encryption. If no
                        keyType  is provided, the service will use the default
                        setting (static-key).

                     Region -> (string)
                        The AWS Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint was

                     ResourceId -> (string)
                        An  identifier for the content. The service sends this
                        value to the key server to identify the  current  end-
                        point.  The  resource  ID is also known as the content
                        ID. This parameter is required  for  SPEKE  encryption
                        and is not valid for static key encryption.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  role  that you created during setup

                        Manager to store the encryption key. This parameter is
                        required  for  static  key encryption and is not valid

                        The URL from the API Gateway proxy that you set up  to
                        talk  to  your  key server. This parameter is required
                        for SPEKE encryption and is not valid for  static  key
                        encryption.

                 EntitlementArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the entitlement.

                     with.  The  receiving  accounts  (subscribers)  will   be
                     allowed  to  create  their own flow using your content as
                     the source.

                     (string)

              The  media  streams that are associated with the flow. After you
              associate a media stream with a source, you can  also  associate
              it with outputs on the flow.

              (structure)
                 A single track or stream of media that contains video, audio,
                 or ancillary data. After you add a media stream  to  a  flow,
                 you  can  associate it with sources and outputs on that flow,
                 as long as they use the CDI protocol or the ST 2110  JPEG  XS
                 protocol.  Each  source  or output can consist of one or many
                 media streams.

                     Attributes that are related to the media stream.

                        ExactFramerate -> (string)
                            The   frame   rate   for   the  video  stream,  in
                            frames/second. For  example:  60000/1001.  If  you
                            specify  a whole number, MediaConnect uses a ratio
                            of N/1. For example, if you specify 60,  MediaCon-
                            nect uses 60/1 as the exactFramerate.

                        Par -> (string)
                            The pixel aspect ratio (PAR) of the video.

                        Tcs -> (string)
                            The transfer characteristic system (TCS)  that  is
                            used in the video.

                     Lang -> (string)
                        The  audio language, in a format that is recognized by
                        the receiver.

                 ClockRate -> (integer)
                     The sample rate for the stream. This value is measured in
                     Hz.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A  description  that  can  help you quickly identify what

                     The format type number (sometimes referred to as RTP pay-
                     load type) of the media stream. MediaConnect assigns this
                     value to the media stream. For ST 2110 JPEG  XS  outputs,
                     you need to provide this value to the receiver.

                 MediaStreamId -> (integer)

                     billed to the subscriber.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description of the output.

                 Destination -> (string)
                     The address where you want to send the output.

                 Encryption -> (structure)
                     The type of key used for the encryption. If no keyType is
                     provided,  the  service  will  use  the  default  setting
                     (static-key).

                     Algorithm -> (string)
                        The  type of algorithm that is used for the encryption

                     KeyType -> (string)
                        The type of key that is used for the encryption. If no

                        The AWS Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint was
                        created  in.  This  parameter  is  required  for SPEKE

                     ResourceId -> (string)
                        An  identifier for the content. The service sends this
                        value to the key server to identify the  current  end-
                        point.  The  resource  ID is also known as the content
