LIST-API-KEYS()                                                LIST-API-KEYS()



NAME
       list-api-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the API keys for a given API.

       NOTE:
          API  keys  are deleted automatically 60 days after they expire. How-
          ever, they may still be included in the  response  until  they  have
          actually  been deleted. You can safely call DeleteApiKey to manually
          delete a key before it's automatically deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-api-keys is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: apiKeys

SYNOPSIS
            list-api-keys
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       apiKeys -> (list)
          The ApiKey objects.

          (structure)
              Describes an API key.

              Customers invoke AppSync GraphQL API operations with API keys as
              an identity mechanism. There are two key versions:
                 da1  : We introduced this version at launch in November 2017.
                 These keys always expire after 7 days.  Amazon  DynamoDB  TTL
                 manages  key  expiration. These keys ceased to be valid after
                 February 21, 2018, and they should no longer be used.

              o ListApiKeys returns the expiration time in milliseconds.

              o CreateApiKey returns the expiration time in milliseconds.

              o UpdateApiKey is not available for this key version.

              o DeleteApiKey deletes the item from the table.

              o Expiration is stored in DynamoDB as milliseconds. This results
                in  a  bug  where  keys  are not automatically deleted because
                DynamoDB expects the  TTL  to  be  stored  in  seconds.  As  a
                one-time  action,  we  deleted  these  keys  from the table on
                February 21, 2018.
                 da2 : We introduced this version in February 2018  when  App-
                 Sync added support to extend key expiration.

              o ListApiKeys  returns  the expiration time and deletion time in
                seconds.

              o CreateApiKey returns the expiration time and deletion time  in
                seconds  and  accepts  a user-provided expiration time in sec-
                onds.

              o UpdateApiKey returns the expiration time and and deletion time
                in seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in sec-
                onds. Expired API keys are kept for 60 days after the  expira-
                tion  time.  You can update the key expiration time as long as
                the key isn't deleted.

              o DeleteApiKey deletes the item from the table.

              o Expiration is stored in DynamoDB as seconds. After the expira-
                tion  time,  using the key to authenticate will fail. However,
                you can reinstate the key before deletion.

              o Deletion is stored in DynamoDB as seconds. The key is  deleted
                after deletion time.

              id -> (string)
                 The API key ID.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the purpose of the API key.

              expires -> (long)
                 The  time after which the API key expires. The date is repre-
                 sented as seconds since the epoch, rounded down to the  near-
                 est hour.

              deletes -> (long)
                 The time after which the API key is deleted. The date is rep-
                 resented as seconds since the  epoch,  rounded  down  to  the
                 nearest hour.

       nextToken -> (string)
          An  identifier  to  pass  in  the  next request to this operation to
          return the next set of items in the list.
