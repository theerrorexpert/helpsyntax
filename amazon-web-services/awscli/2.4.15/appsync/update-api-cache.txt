       update-api-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the cache for the GraphQL API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-api-cache
          --api-id <value>
          --ttl <value>
          --api-caching-behavior <value>
          --type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The GraphQL API ID.

       --ttl (long)
          TTL in seconds for cache entries.

          Valid values are 13,600 seconds.

       --api-caching-behavior (string)
          Caching behavior.

          o FULL_REQUEST_CACHING : All requests are fully cached.

          o PER_RESOLVER_CACHING  :  Individual resolvers that you specify are
            cached.

          Possible values:

          o FULL_REQUEST_CACHING

          o PER_RESOLVER_CACHING

       --type (string)
          The cache instance type. Valid values are

          o SMALL

          o MEDIUM

          o LARGE

          o XLARGE

          o LARGE_2X

          o LARGE_4X

          o LARGE_8X (not available in all regions)

          o LARGE_12X

          Historically, instance types were identified by an EC2-style  value.
          As  of  July  2020,  this is deprecated, and the generic identifiers
          above should be used.

          The following legacy instance types are available, but their use  is
          discouraged:

          o T2_SMALL : A t2.small instance type.

          o T2_MEDIUM : A t2.medium instance type.

          o R4_LARGE : A r4.large instance type.

          o R4_XLARGE : A r4.xlarge instance type.

          o R4_2XLARGE : A r4.2xlarge instance type.

          o R4_4XLARGE : A r4.4xlarge instance type.

          o R4_8XLARGE : A r4.8xlarge instance type.

          Possible values:

          o T2_SMALL

          o T2_MEDIUM

          o R4_LARGE

          o R4_XLARGE

          o R4_2XLARGE

          o R4_4XLARGE

          o R4_8XLARGE

          o SMALL

          o MEDIUM

          o LARGE

          o XLARGE

          o LARGE_2X

          o LARGE_4X

          o LARGE_8X

          o LARGE_12X

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The ApiCache object.

          ttl -> (long)
              TTL in seconds for cache entries.
