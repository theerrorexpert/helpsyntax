NAME
       get-graphql-api -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a GraphqlApi object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-graphql-api
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API ID for the GraphQL API.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 the relying party is  registered  with  the  OpenID  identity
                 provider.  You  can specify a regular expression so that App-

                        to be called for authorization. This can be a standard
                        Lambda  ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                            Note : This Lambda function must have the  follow-
                            ing  resource-based  policy  assigned  to it. When
                            configuring Lambda  authorizers  in  the  console,
                            this  is  done  for  you.  To use the Command Line
