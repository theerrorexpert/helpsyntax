                     Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                        Note  :  This  Lambda function must have the following
                        resource-based policy assigned to it. When configuring
                        Lambda  authorizers  in  the console, this is done for
                        you. To use the Command Line Interface (CLI), run  the

              The number of seconds a  response  should  be  cached  for.  The
              default  is  5  minutes  (300  seconds). The Lambda function can
              override this by returning a ttlOverride key in its response.  A
              value of 0 disables caching of responses.

          authorizerUri -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the Lambda function to be
              called for authorization. This can be a standard Lambda  ARN,  a
              version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                 Note   :   This  Lambda  function  must  have  the  following
                 resource-based policy assigned to it. When configuring Lambda
                 authorizers  in the console, this is done for you. To use the
                 Command Line Interface (CLI), run the following:

            "authorizerUri": "string",
            "identityValidationExpression": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                     issuer -> (string)
                        The  issuer  for  the  OIDC  configuration. The issuer
                        returned by discovery must exactly match the value  of
                        iss in the ID token.

                     clientId -> (string)
                        The  client  identifier  of  the  relying party at the
                        OpenID identity provider. This identifier is typically
                        obtained when the relying party is registered with the
                        OpenID identity provider. You can  specify  a  regular
                        expression so that AppSync can validate against multi-
                        ple client identifiers at a time.

                     iatTTL -> (long)
                        The number of milliseconds that a token is valid after
                        it's issued to a user.

                     authTTL -> (long)
                        The number of milliseconds that a token is valid after
                        being authenticated.

                 userPoolConfig -> (structure)
                     The Amazon Cognito user pool configuration.

                     userPoolId -> (string)
                        The user pool ID.

                     awsRegion -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Region in which the user  pool
                        was created.

                     appIdClientRegex -> (string)
                        A  regular expression for validating the incoming Ama-
                        zon Cognito user pool app client ID.

                 lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
                     Configuration for Lambda function authorization.

                     authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The number of seconds a response should be cached for.
                        The  default  is  5  minutes (300 seconds). The Lambda
                        function can override this by returning a  ttlOverride
                        key  in its response. A value of 0 disables caching of
                        responses.

                     authorizerUri -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda  function
                        to be called for authorization. This can be a standard
                        Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias  ARN.
                            Note  : This Lambda function must have the follow-
                            ing resource-based policy  assigned  to  it.  When
                            configuring  Lambda  authorizers  in  the console,
                            this is done for you.  To  use  the  Command  Line
                            Interface (CLI), run the following:

                            aws    lambda    add-permission    --function-name
                            "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:111122223333:func-

                        A  regular  expression for validation of tokens before
                        the Lambda function is called.

          xrayEnabled -> (boolean)
              A  flag  indicating  whether  to  use  X-Ray  tracing  for  this
              GraphqlApi .

          wafWebAclArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the  WAF access control list (ACL) associated with
              this GraphqlApi , if one exists.

          lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration for Lambda function authorization.

              authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The number of seconds a response should be  cached  for.  The
                 default  is  5 minutes (300 seconds). The Lambda function can
                 override this by returning a ttlOverride key in its response.
                 A value of 0 disables caching of responses.

              authorizerUri -> (string)

                 called for authorization. This can be a standard Lambda  ARN,
                 a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                     Note  :  This  Lambda  function  must  have the following

                     To use the Command Line Interface (CLI), run the  follow-
                     ing:

                     aws       lambda      add-permission      --function-name
