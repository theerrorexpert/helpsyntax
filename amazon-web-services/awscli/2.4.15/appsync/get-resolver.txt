NAME
       get-resolver -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a Resolver object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resolver
          --api-id <value>
          --type-name <value>
          --field-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API ID.

       --type-name (string)
          The resolver type name.

       --field-name (string)
          The resolver field name.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       resolver -> (structure)
          The Resolver object.

          typeName -> (string)
              The resolver type name.

          fieldName -> (string)
              The resolver field name.

          dataSourceName -> (string)
              The resolver data source name.

          resolverArn -> (string)
              The resolver Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          requestMappingTemplate -> (string)
              The request mapping template.

          responseMappingTemplate -> (string)
              The response mapping template.

          kind -> (string)
              The resolver type.

              o UNIT  :  A  UNIT resolver type. A UNIT resolver is the default
                resolver type. You can use a UNIT resolver to  run  a  GraphQL
                query against a single data source.

              o PIPELINE  :  A  PIPELINE resolver type. You can use a PIPELINE
                resolver to invoke a series of Function objects  in  a  serial
                manner. You can use a pipeline resolver to run a GraphQL query
                against multiple data sources.

          pipelineConfig -> (structure)
              The PipelineConfig .

              functions -> (list)
                 A list of Function objects.

                 (string)

          syncConfig -> (structure)
              The SyncConfig for a  resolver  attached  to  a  versioned  data
              source.

              conflictHandler -> (string)
                 The Conflict Resolution strategy to perform in the event of a
                 conflict.

                 o OPTIMISTIC_CONCURRENCY :  Resolve  conflicts  by  rejecting
                   mutations  when  versions don't match the latest version at
                   the server.

                 o AUTOMERGE : Resolve conflicts with the  Automerge  conflict
                   resolution strategy.

                 o LAMBDA : Resolve conflicts with an Lambda function supplied
                   in the LambdaConflictHandlerConfig .

              conflictDetection -> (string)
                 The Conflict Detection strategy to use.

                 o VERSION : Detect conflicts based  on  object  versions  for
                   this resolver.

                 o NONE : Do not detect conflicts when invoking this resolver.

              lambdaConflictHandlerConfig -> (structure)
                 The LambdaConflictHandlerConfig when  configuring  LAMBDA  as
                 the Conflict Handler.

                 lambdaConflictHandlerArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Lambda function to
                     use as the Conflict Handler.

          cachingConfig -> (structure)
              The caching configuration for the resolver.

              ttl -> (long)
                 The TTL in seconds for a resolver that has caching activated.

                 Valid values are 13,600 seconds.

              cachingKeys -> (list)
                 The caching keys for a resolver that has caching activated.

                 Valid  values are entries from the $context.arguments , $con-
                 text.source , and $context.identity maps.

                 (string)

          maxBatchSize -> (integer)
              The maximum batching size for a resolver.
