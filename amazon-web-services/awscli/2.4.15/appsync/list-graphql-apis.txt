LIST-GRAPHQL-APIS()                                        LIST-GRAPHQL-APIS()



NAME
       list-graphql-apis -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your GraphQL APIs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-graphql-apis  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: graphqlApis

SYNOPSIS
            list-graphql-apis
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     when the relying party  is  registered  with  the  OpenID
                     identity  provider.  You can specify a regular expression
                     so that AppSync  can  validate  against  multiple  client
                     identifiers at a time.

              additionalAuthenticationProviders -> (list)
                 A   list  of  additional  authentication  providers  for  the
                 GraphqlApi API.

                            The issuer for the OIDC configuration. The  issuer
                            returned by discovery must exactly match the value
                            of iss in the ID token.

                            cally obtained when the relying  party  is  regis-
                            tered  with  the OpenID identity provider. You can
                            specify a regular expression so that  AppSync  can
                            validate  against multiple client identifiers at a
                            time.

                        iatTTL -> (long)
                            The number of milliseconds that a token  is  valid

                        authTTL -> (long)
                            The  number  of milliseconds that a token is valid

                            pool was created.

                        appIdClientRegex -> (string)

                     lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
                        Configuration for Lambda function authorization.

                        authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The number of seconds a response should be  cached
                            for.  The  default is 5 minutes (300 seconds). The
                            Lambda function can override this by  returning  a
                            ttlOverride key in its response. A value of 0 dis-
                            ables caching of responses.

                        authorizerUri -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda func-
                            tion to be called for authorization. This can be a
                            standard Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3  ),  or
                            an alias ARN.
                               Note  : This Lambda function must have the fol-
                               lowing resource-based policy  assigned  to  it.
                               When configuring Lambda authorizers in the con-
                               sole, this is done for you. To use the  Command
                               Line Interface (CLI), run the following:

                               aws   lambda   add-permission   --function-name
                               "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:111122223333:func-
                               tion:my-function"    --statement-id   "appsync"
                               --principal   appsync.amazonaws.com    --action
                               lambda:InvokeFunction

                        identityValidationExpression -> (string)
                            A  regular  expression  for  validation  of tokens
                            before the Lambda function is called.

              xrayEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A flag indicating whether  to  use  X-Ray  tracing  for  this
                 GraphqlApi .

              wafWebAclArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the WAF access control list (ACL) associated with
                 this GraphqlApi , if one exists.

              lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
                 Configuration for Lambda function authorization.

                 authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The number of seconds a response should  be  cached  for.
                     The  default is 5 minutes (300 seconds). The Lambda func-
                     tion can override this by returning a ttlOverride key  in
                     its response. A value of 0 disables caching of responses.

                 authorizerUri -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function  to
                     be  called  for  authorization.  This  can  be a standard
                     Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                        Note : This Lambda function must  have  the  following
                        resource-based policy assigned to it. When configuring
                        Lambda authorizers in the console, this  is  done  for
                        you.  To use the Command Line Interface (CLI), run the
                        following:

                        aws     lambda     add-permission      --function-name
                        "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:111122223333:func-
                        tion:my-function" --statement-id "appsync" --principal
                        appsync.amazonaws.com --action lambda:InvokeFunction

                 identityValidationExpression -> (string)
                     A  regular expression for validation of tokens before the
                     Lambda function is called.

       nextToken -> (string)
          An identifier to pass in the  next  request  to  this  operation  to
          return the next set of items in the list.
