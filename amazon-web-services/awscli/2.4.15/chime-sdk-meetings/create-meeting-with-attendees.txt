          }

       --attendees (list)
          The  attendee information, including attendees' IDs and join tokens.

          (structure)
              The Amazon Chime SDK attendee fields to create,  used  with  the
              BatchCreateAttendee action.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a  unique  Atten-

              cate and join as the specified attendee. The  JoinToken  expires
              when  the meeting ends, or when  DeleteAttendee is called. After
              that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

              We recommend securely  transferring  each  JoinToken  from  your
              server  application  to  the  client so that no other client has
              access to the token except for the one authorized  to  represent

          a list of the attendees is returned,  along  with  error  codes  and
          error messages.

                 cation.
