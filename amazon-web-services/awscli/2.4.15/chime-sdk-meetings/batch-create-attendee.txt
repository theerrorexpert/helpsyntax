SYNOPSIS
            batch-create-attendee
          --meeting-id <value>
          --attendees <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --meeting-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime SDK ID of the meeting to which you're adding atten-
          dees.

       --attendees (list)
          The attendee information, including attendees' IDs and join  tokens.

          (structure)
              The  Amazon  Chime  SDK attendee fields to create, used with the
              BatchCreateAttendee action.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency  token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ExternalUserId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ExternalUserId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Attendees -> (list)
          The attendee information, including attendees' IDs and join  tokens.

          (structure)
              An  Amazon  Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a unique Atten-
              deeId and JoinToken . The JoinToken allows a client to authenti-
              cate  and  join as the specified attendee. The JoinToken expires
              when the meeting ends, or when  DeleteAttendee is called.  After
              that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

              We  recommend  securely  transferring  each  JoinToken from your
              server application to the client so that  no  other  client  has
              access  to  the token except for the one authorized to represent
              the attendee.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency  token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              AttendeeId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

              JoinToken -> (string)
                 The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

       Errors -> (list)
          If the action fails for one or more of the attendees in the request,
          a  list  of  the  attendees  is returned, along with error codes and
          error messages.

          (structure)
              The list of errors returned when errors are  encountered  during
              the   BatchCreateAttendee   and   CreateAttendee  actions.  This
              includes external user IDs, error codes, and error messages.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency  token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message.
