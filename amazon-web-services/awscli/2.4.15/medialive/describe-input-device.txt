DESCRIBE-INPUT-DEVICE()                                DESCRIBE-INPUT-DEVICE()



NAME
       describe-input-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the details for the input device

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-input-device
          --input-device-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --input-device-id  (string)  The  unique  ID  of this input device. For
       example, hd-123456789abcdef.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The unique ARN of the input device.

       ConnectionState -> (string)
          The state of the connection between the input device and AWS.

       DeviceSettingsSyncState -> (string)
          The status of the action to synchronize the device configuration. If
          you  change  the configuration of the input device (for example, the
          maximum bitrate), MediaLive sends the new data to  the  device.  The
          device  might not update itself immediately. SYNCED means the device
          has updated its configuration. SYNCING means that it has not updated
          its configuration.

       DeviceUpdateStatus -> (string)
          The status of software on the input device.

       HdDeviceSettings -> (structure)
          Settings that describe an input device that is type HD.

          ActiveInput -> (string)
              If  you  specified Auto as the configured input, specifies which
              of the sources is currently active (SDI or HDMI).

          ConfiguredInput -> (string)
              The source at the input device that is currently active. You can
              specify this source.

          DeviceState -> (string)
              The state of the input device.

          Framerate -> (double)
              The frame rate of the video source.

          Height -> (integer)
              The height of the video source, in pixels.

          MaxBitrate -> (integer)
              The  current  maximum bitrate for ingesting this source, in bits
              per second. You can specify this maximum.

          ScanType -> (string)
              The scan type of the video source.

          Width -> (integer)
              The width of the video source, in pixels.

       Id -> (string)
          The unique ID of the input device.

       MacAddress -> (string)
          The network MAC address of the input device.

       Name -> (string)
          A name that you specify for the input device.

       NetworkSettings -> (structure)
          The network settings for the input device.

          DnsAddresses -> (list)
              The DNS addresses of the input device.

              (string)
                 Placeholder documentation for __string

          Gateway -> (string)
              The network gateway IP address.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address of the input device.

          IpScheme -> (string)
              Specifies whether the input device has been configured  (outside
              of MediaLive) to use a dynamic IP address assignment (DHCP) or a
              static IP address.

          SubnetMask -> (string)
              The subnet mask of the input device.

       SerialNumber -> (string)
          The unique serial number of the input device.

       Type -> (string)
          The type of the input device.

       UhdDeviceSettings -> (structure)
          Settings that describe an input device that is type UHD.

          ActiveInput -> (string)
              If you specified Auto as the configured input,  specifies  which
              of the sources is currently active (SDI or HDMI).

          ConfiguredInput -> (string)
              The source at the input device that is currently active. You can
              specify this source.

          DeviceState -> (string)
              The state of the input device.

          Framerate -> (double)
              The frame rate of the video source.

          Height -> (integer)
              The height of the video source, in pixels.

          MaxBitrate -> (integer)
              The current maximum bitrate for ingesting this source,  in  bits
              per second. You can specify this maximum.

          ScanType -> (string)
              The scan type of the video source.
