DESCRIBE-INPUT()                                              DESCRIBE-INPUT()



NAME
       describe-input -

DESCRIPTION
       Produces details about an input

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-input
          --input-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --input-id (string) Unique ID of the input

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Unique ARN of the input (generated, immutable).

       AttachedChannels -> (list)
          A  list  of channel IDs that that input is attached to (currently an
          input can only be attached to one channel).

          (string)
              Placeholder documentation for __string

       Destinations -> (list)
          A list of the destinations of the input (PUSH-type).

          (structure)
              The settings for a PUSH type input.

              Ip -> (string)
                 The  system-generated  static  IP  address  of  endpoint.  It
                 remains fixed for the lifetime of the input.

              Port -> (string)
                 The port number for the input.

              Url -> (string)
                 This represents the endpoint that the customer stream will be
                 pushed to.

              Vpc -> (structure)
                 The properties for a VPC type input destination.

                 AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                     The availability zone of the Input destination.

                 NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                     The network interface ID of the Input destination in  the
                     VPC.

       Id -> (string)
          The  generated ID of the input (unique for user account, immutable).

       InputClass -> (string)
          STANDARD - MediaLive expects two sources to  be  connected  to  this
          input.  If  the  channel  is  also  STANDARD,  both  sources will be
          ingested. If the channel is SINGLE_PIPELINE, only the  first  source
          will  be ingested; the second source will always be ignored, even if
          the first source fails. SINGLE_PIPELINE - You can connect  only  one
          source  to  this input. If the ChannelClass is also SINGLE_PIPELINE,
          this value is valid. If the ChannelClass is STANDARD, this value  is
          not valid because the channel requires two sources in the input.

       InputDevices -> (list)
          Settings for the input devices.

          (structure)
              Settings for an input device.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique ID for the device.

       InputPartnerIds -> (list)
          A list of IDs for all Inputs which are partners of this one.

          (string)
              Placeholder documentation for __string

       InputSourceType -> (string)
          Certain  pull  input  sources  can be dynamic, meaning that they can
          have their URL's dynamically changes during  input  switch  actions.
          Presently,  this  functionality only works with MP4_FILE and TS_FILE
          inputs.

       MediaConnectFlows -> (list)
          A list of MediaConnect Flows for this input.

          (structure)
              The settings for a MediaConnect Flow.

              FlowArn -> (string)
                 The unique ARN of the  MediaConnect  Flow  being  used  as  a
                 source.

       Name -> (string)
          The user-assigned name (This is a mutable value).

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role this input assumes during
          and after creation.

       SecurityGroups -> (list)

          input.

          (string)

              PasswordParam -> (string)
                 The  key  used  to  extract  the  password from EC2 Parameter
                 store.

              Url -> (string)
                 This represents the customer's source  URL  where  stream  is
                 pulled from.

              Username -> (string)
                 The username for the input source.
