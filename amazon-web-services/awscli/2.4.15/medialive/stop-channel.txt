NAME
       stop-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a running channel

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-channel
          --channel-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-id (string) A request to stop a running channel

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            depend  on  rate  control  mode  and  profile. The
                            adReceiverMix setting receives a  stereo  descrip-
                            tion  plus  control  track  and  emits  a mono AAC
                            encode of the description track, with control data
                            emitted  in  the PES header as per ETSI TS 101 154

                            pre-mixed  main audio + AD (narration) as a stereo
                            pair. The Audio Type field (audioType) will be set
                            to  3,  which  signals  to downstream systems that
                            this stream contains "broadcaster mixed AD".  Note
                            that  the  input received by the encoder must con-
                            tain pre-mixed audio; the encoder does not perform
                            the  mixing.  The  values  in audioTypeControl and
                            audioType (in AudioDescription) are  ignored  when
                            set  to  broadcasterMixedAd. Leave set to "normal"
                            when input does not contain pre-mixed audio +  AD.

                            Specifies  the  color  of the rectangle behind the
                            captions. All burn-in and  DVB-Sub  font  settings
                            must match.

                        BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specifies the opacity of the background rectangle.
                            255 is opaque;  0  is  transparent.  Leaving  this
                            parameter  out  is  equivalent  to setting it to 0

                            text  sources  use  a  strict  grid  system. Using
                            external fonts with these  caption  sources  could
                            cause  unexpected  display  of proportional fonts.

                        ShadowColor -> (string)
                            Specifies the color of the shadow cast by the cap-
                            tions.  All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must
                            match.

                        ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specifies  the  opacity  of  the  shadow.  255  is
                            opaque;  0  is transparent. Leaving this parameter
                            out is equivalent to setting it  to  0  (transpar-

                            would result in a shadow offset 2  pixels  to  the
                            left.  All  burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must
                            match.

                        ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                            Specifies the vertical offset of the shadow  rela-
                            tive  to  the  captions  in  pixels. A value of -2
                            would result in a shadow offset 2 pixels above the

                        XPosition -> (integer)
                            Specifies  the  horizontal position of the caption
                            relative to the left side of the output in pixels.
                            A  value of 10 would result in the captions start-
                            ing 10 pixels from the left of the output.  If  no
                            explicit  xPosition  is  provided,  the horizontal
                            caption position will be determined by the  align-
                            ment  parameter. All burn-in and DVB-Sub font set-

                        YPosition -> (integer)
                            Specifies the vertical  position  of  the  caption
                            relative  to  the  top  of the output in pixels. A
                            value of 10 would result in the captions  starting
                            10  pixels  from  the  top  of  the  output. If no
                            explicit yPosition is provided, the  caption  will
                            be  positioned  towards  the bottom of the output.
                            All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must  match.

                            If no explicit xPosition or yPosition is provided,
                            setting alignment to centered will place the  cap-
                            tions  at  the  bottom center of the output. Simi-
                            larly, setting a left alignment  will  align  cap-
                            tions to the bottom left of the output. If x and y
                            positions are given in conjunction with the align-
                            ment parameter, the font will be justified (either
                            left or centered) relative to  those  coordinates.
                            Selecting  "smart" justification will left-justify
                            live  subtitles  and  center-justify  pre-recorded
                            subtitles.  This  option  is  not valid for source

                            match.

                        TeletextGridControl -> (string)
                            Controls whether a fixed grid size will be used to
                            generate the output subtitles bitmap. Only  appli-
                            cable for Teletext inputs and DVB-Sub/Burn-in out-
                            puts.

                        XPosition -> (integer)
                            Specifies the horizontal position of  the  caption
                            relative to the left side of the output in pixels.
                            A value of 10 would result in the captions  start-
                            ing  10  pixels from the left of the output. If no
                            explicit xPosition  is  provided,  the  horizontal
                            caption  position will be determined by the align-
                            ment parameter.  This  option  is  not  valid  for
                            source  captions  that  are  STL,  608/embedded or
                            teletext.  These  source  settings   are   already
                            pre-defined by the caption stream. All burn-in and
                            DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                        YPosition -> (integer)
                            Specifies the vertical  position  of  the  caption
                            relative  to  the  top  of the output in pixels. A
                            value of 10 would result in the captions  starting
                            10  pixels  from  the  top  of  the  output. If no
                            explicit yPosition is provided, the  caption  will
                            be  positioned  towards  the bottom of the output.
                            This option is not valid for source captions  that
                            are  STL,  608/embedded  or teletext. These source
                            settings are already pre-defined  by  the  caption
                            stream. All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must
                            match.

                            if styleControl is set to include.  If  you  leave
                            this  field  empty,  the  font  family  is  set to
                            "monospaced". (If styleControl is set to  exclude,
                            the  font  family  is always set to "monospaced".)
                            You specify only the font family. All other  style
                            information  (color,  bold, position and so on) is
                            copied from the input captions. The size is always

                            serif), or default (to let the  downstream  player
                            choose  the font). - Leave blank to set the family
                            to monospace.

                            that  is  attached  to  the  EBU-TT  captions.   -
                            include:  Take  the style information (font color,
                            font position, and so on) from the source captions
                            and  include  that  information  in  the font data
                            attached to the EBU-TT captions.  This  option  is
                            valid  only if the source captions are Embedded or
                            Teletext. - exclude: In the font data attached  to
                            the  EBU-TT  captions,  set  the  font  family  to
                            "monospaced".  Do  not  include  any  other  style

                            are required in the manifest (according to the HLS
                            specification) and  serve  an  important  purpose.

                                   If a streaming output fails, number of sec-
                                   onds to wait until a restart is  initiated.
                                   A value of 0 means never restart.

                        HlsId3SegmentTagging -> (string)
                            State of HLS ID3 Segment Tagging

                        IFrameOnlyPlaylists -> (string)
                            DISABLED:  Do not create an I-frame-only manifest,
                            but do  create  the  master  and  media  manifests
                            (according  to  the Output Selection field). STAN-
                            DARD: Create an  I-frame-only  manifest  for  each
                            output  that  contains video, as well as the other
                            manifests  (according  to  the  Output   Selection
                            field).    The   I-frame   manifest   contains   a
                            #EXT-X-I-FRAMES-ONLY tag to indicate it is I-frame
                            only,  and  one  or  more #EXT-X-BYTERANGE entries
                            identifying the  I-frame  position.  For  example,
                            #EXT-X-BYTERANGE:160364@1461888"

                        IncompleteSegmentBehavior -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether  to  include  the final (incom-
                            plete) segment in the media output when the  pipe-
                            line  stops  producing output because of a channel
                            stop, a channel pause or a loss of  input  to  the
                            pipeline.   Auto   means  that  MediaLive  decides
                            whether to include the final segment, depending on
                            the  channel class and the types of output groups.
                            Suppress means to  never  include  the  incomplete
                            segment.  We  recommend  you  choose  Auto and let
                            MediaLive control the behavior.

                        IndexNSegments -> (integer)
                            Applies only if Mode field is LIVE. Specifies  the
                            maximum  number  of segments in the media manifest
                            file.  After  this  maximum,  older  segments  are
                            removed  from the media manifest. This number must
                            be smaller than the number in  the  Keep  Segments
                            field.

                        InputLossAction -> (string)
                            Parameter  that  control  output group behavior on
                            input loss.

                        IvInManifest -> (string)
                            For use with encryptionType. The  IV  (Initializa-
                            tion  Vector) is a 128-bit number used in conjunc-
                            tion with the key for encrypting blocks. If set to
                            "include", IV is listed in the manifest, otherwise
                            the IV is not in the manifest.

                        IvSource -> (string)
                            For use with encryptionType. The  IV  (Initializa-
                            tion  Vector) is a 128-bit number used in conjunc-
                            tion with the key for encrypting blocks.  If  this
                            setting  is  "followsSegmentNumber", it will cause
                            the IV to change every segment (to match the  seg-
                            ment  number).  If  this is set to "explicit", you
                            must enter a constantIv value.

                        KeepSegments -> (integer)
                            Applies only if Mode field is LIVE. Specifies  the
                            number of media segments to retain in the destina-
                            tion directory. This number should be bigger  than
                            indexNSegments (Num segments). We recommend (value
                            = (2 x indexNsegments) + 1). If  this  "keep  seg-
                            ments" number is too low, the following might hap-
                            pen: the player is still reading a media  manifest
                            file that lists this segment, but that segment has
                            been removed from the  destination  directory  (as
                            directed  by indexNSegments). This situation would
                            result in a 404 HTTP error on the player.

                        KeyFormat -> (string)
                            The value specifies how the key is represented  in
                            the  resource  identified by the URI. If parameter
                            is absent, an  implicit  value  of  "identity"  is
                            used. A reverse DNS string can also be given.

                        KeyFormatVersions -> (string)
                            Either  a single positive integer version value or
                            a slash delimited list of version values  (1/2/3).

                        KeyProviderSettings -> (structure)
                            The key provider settings.

                            StaticKeySettings -> (structure)
                               Static Key Settings

                               KeyProviderServer -> (structure)
                                   The URL of the license server used for pro-
                                   tecting content.

                                   PasswordParam -> (string)
                                      key used to extract  the  password  from
                                      EC2 Parameter store

                                   Uri -> (string)
                                      Uniform   Resource   Identifier  -  This
                                      should be a path to a file accessible to
                                      the  Live  system  (eg.  a  http:// URI)
                                      depending on the output type. For  exam-
                                      ple,  a  RTMP  destination should have a
                                      uri simliar to: "rtmp://fmsserver/live".

                                   Username -> (string)
                                      Documentation update needed

                               StaticKeyValue -> (string)
                                   Static key value as a 32 character hexadec-
                                   imal string.

                        ManifestCompression -> (string)
                            When set to gzip, compresses HLS playlist.

                        ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                            Indicates whether the output manifest  should  use
                            floating point or integer values for segment dura-
                            tion.

                        MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                            When  set,  minimumSegmentLength  is  enforced  by
                            looking  ahead and back within the specified range
                            for a nearby avail and extending the segment  size
                            if needed.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            If "vod", all segments are indexed and kept perma-
                            nently in the destination and manifest. If "live",
                            only the number segments specified in keepSegments
                            and  indexNSegments  are  kept;   newer   segments
                            replace  older segments, which may prevent players
                            from rewinding all the way to the beginning of the
                            event.  VOD  mode  uses HLS EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE of
                            EVENT while the channel is running, converting  it
                            to  a  "VOD"  type  manifest  on completion of the
                            stream.

                        OutputSelection -> (string)
                            MANIFESTS_AND_SEGMENTS: Generates manifests  (mas-
                            ter  manifest, if applicable, and media manifests)
                            for this output group.  VARIANT_MANIFESTS_AND_SEG-
                            MENTS:  Generates  media manifests for this output
                            group, but not a master  manifest.  SEGMENTS_ONLY:
                            Does  not  generate  any manifests for this output
                            group.

                        ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                            Includes or excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  tag
                            in  .m3u8  manifest files. The value is calculated
                            using the program date time clock.

                        ProgramDateTimeClock -> (string)
                            Specifies the algorithm  used  to  drive  the  HLS
                            EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  clock.  Options  include:
                            INITIALIZE_FROM_OUTPUT_TIMECODE: The PDT clock  is
                            initialized  as  a  function  of  the first output
                            timecode, then incremented by the EXTINF  duration
                            of  each  encoded  segment.  SYSTEM_CLOCK: The PDT
                            clock is initialized as a function of the UTC wall
                            clock,  then incremented by the EXTINF duration of
                            each encoded segment. If the  PDT  clock  diverges
                            from  the  wall  clock  by  more than 500ms, it is
                            resynchronized to the wall clock.

                        ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                            Period  of  insertion  of  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                            entry, in seconds.

                        RedundantManifest -> (string)
                            ENABLED: The master manifest (.m3u8 file) for each
                            pipeline includes  information  about  both  pipe-
                            lines:  first  its own media files, then the media
                            files of the other pipeline. This  feature  allows
                            playout  device that support stale manifest detec-
                            tion to switch from one  manifest  to  the  other,
                            when the current manifest seems to be stale. There
                            are still two destinations and  two  master  mani-
                            fests,  but  both  master  manifests reference the
                            media files from  both  pipelines.  DISABLED:  The
                            master  manifest  (.m3u8  file)  for each pipeline
                            includes information about its own pipeline  only.
                            For  an  HLS output group with MediaPackage as the
                            destination, the DISABLED behavior is always  fol-
                            lowed.  MediaPackage  regenerates the manifests it
                            serves to players so  a  redundant  manifest  from
                            MediaLive is irrelevant.

                        SegmentLength -> (integer)
                            Length of MPEG-2 Transport Stream segments to cre-
                            ate (in seconds). Note that segments will  end  on
                            the next keyframe after this number of seconds, so
                            actual segment length may be longer.

                        SegmentationMode -> (string)
                            useInputSegmentation has been deprecated. The con-
                            figured segment size is always used.

                        SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                            Number  of  segments  to  write  to a subdirectory
                            before starting a new one. directoryStructure must
                            be  subdirectoryPerStream for this setting to have
                            an effect.

                        StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                            Include or exclude RESOLUTION attribute for  video
                            in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant manifest.

                        TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                            Indicates ID3 frame that has the timecode.

                        TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                            Timed Metadata interval in seconds.

                        TimestampDeltaMilliseconds -> (integer)
                            Provides an extra millisecond delta offset to fine
                            tune the timestamps.

                        TsFileMode -> (string)
                            SEGMENTED_FILES: Emit the program  as  segments  -
                            multiple  .ts  media  files.  SINGLE_FILE: Applies
                            only if Mode field is VOD. Emit the program  as  a
                            single .ts media file. The media manifest includes
                            #EXT-X-BYTERANGE tags to index segments for  play-
                            back. A typical use for this value is when sending
                            the output to AWS  Elemental  MediaConvert,  which
                            can  accept  only  a  single  media file. Playback
                            while the channel is running is not guaranteed due
                            to HTTP server caching.

                     MediaPackageGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Media Package Group Settings

                               Placeholder documentation for __string

                     MsSmoothGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Ms Smooth Group Settings

                     RtmpGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Rtmp Group Settings

                        AdMarkers -> (list)
                            Choose  the  ad marker type for this output group.
                            MediaLive will create a message based on the  con-
                            tent  of  each SCTE-35 message, format it for that
                            marker type, and insert it in the datastream.

                            (string)

                        CacheFullBehavior -> (string)
                            Controls  behavior when content cache fills up. If
                            remote origin server stalls  the  RTMP  connection
                            and does not accept content fast enough the 'Media
                            Cache' will fill up. When the  cache  reaches  the
                            duration  specified  by cacheLength the cache will
                            stop accepting new content. If set  to  disconnec-
                            tImmediately, the RTMP output will force a discon-
                            nect. Clear the media cache, and  reconnect  after
                            restartDelay seconds. If set to waitForServer, the
                            RTMP output will wait up to 5 minutes to allow the
                            origin server to begin accepting data again.

                        CacheLength -> (integer)
                            Cache  length,  in  seconds,  is used to calculate
                            buffer size.

                        CaptionData -> (string)
                            Controls the types of data that passes  to  onCap-
                            tionInfo outputs. If set to 'all' then 608 and 708
                            carried DTVCC data  will  be  passed.  If  set  to
                            'field1AndField2608'   then  DTVCC  data  will  be
                            stripped out, but 608 data from both  fields  will
                            be  passed.  If  set  to 'field1608' then only the
                            data carried in 608 from field  1  video  will  be
                            passed.

                        InputLossAction -> (string)
                            Controls  the behavior of this RTMP group if input
                            becomes unavailable. - emitOutput:  Emit  a  slate
                            until input returns. - pauseOutput: Stop transmit-
                            ting data until input returns. This does not close
                            the underlying RTMP connection.

                        RestartDelay -> (integer)
                            If  a streaming output fails, number of seconds to
                            wait until a restart is initiated. A  value  of  0
                            means never restart.

                     UdpGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Udp Group Settings

                        InputLossAction -> (string)
                            Specifies behavior of last resort when input video
                            is lost, and no more backup inputs are  available.
                            When  dropTs  is  selected  the  entire  transport
                            stream will stop being emitted.  When  dropProgram
                            is  selected  the  program can be dropped from the
                            transport stream (and replaced with  null  packets
                            to  meet  the  TS  bitrate  requirement). Or, when
                            emitProgram is chosen the  transport  stream  will
                            continue  to  be  produced  normally  with  repeat
                            frames, black frames, or slate frames  substituted
                            for the absent input video.

                                      AbsentInputAudioBehavior -> (string)
                                          When   set  to  drop,  output  audio
                                          streams will  be  removed  from  the
                                          program  if the selected input audio
                                          stream is removed  from  the  input.
                                          This allows the output audio config-
                                          uration to dynamically change  based
                                          on  input  configuration. If this is
                                          set  to  encodeSilence,  all  output
                                          audio  streams  will  output encoded
                                          silence when  not  connected  to  an
                                          active input stream.

                                          decimal  values.  Each PID specified
                                          must be  in  the  range  of  32  (or
                                          0x20)..8182 (or 0x1ff6).

                                      AudioStreamType -> (string)
                                          When set to atsc, uses stream type =
                                          0x81 for AC3 and stream type =  0x87
                                          for  EAC3.  When  set  to  dvb, uses
                                          stream type = 0x06.

                                          stream  in  bits per second. Setting
                                          to 0 lets  the  muxer  automatically
                                          determine the appropriate bitrate.

                                      BufferModel -> (string)
                                          Controls  the  timing  accuracy  for

                                          MULTIPLEX to ensure accurate network
                                          packet timing. Or set to NONE, which
                                          might  result  in  lower latency but
                                          will result in more  variability  in
                                          output  network  packet timing. This
                                          variability  might  cause  interrup-
                                          tions, jitter, or bursty behavior in
                                          your playback or receiving  devices.

                                          transport stream. When no  value  is
                                          given,  the  encoder will assign the
                                          same value as the Video PID. Can  be
                                          entered  as a decimal or hexadecimal
                                          value.  Valid  values  are  32   (or

                                      SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                          The   segmentation  style  parameter
                                          controls  how  segmentation  markers
                                          are   inserted  into  the  transport
                                          stream. With avails, it is  possible
                                          that   segments  may  be  truncated,
                                          which  can  influence  where  future
                                          segmentation  markers  are inserted.
                                          When a segmentation style of "reset-
                                          Cadence"  is  selected and a segment
                                          is truncated due  to  an  avail,  we
                                          will reset the segmentation cadence.
                                          This means  the  subsequent  segment
                                          will  have  a duration of $segmenta-
                                          tionTime seconds. When  a  segmenta-
                                          tion  style  of "maintainCadence" is
                                          selected and a segment is  truncated
                                          due  to  an avail, we will not reset
                                          the segmentation cadence. This means
                                          the  subsequent  segment will likely
                                          be truncated as well.  However,  all
                                          segments  after  that  will  have  a
                                          duration of  $segmentationTime  sec-
                                          onds.  Note  that EBP lookahead is a
                                          slight exception to this rule.

                                      SegmentationTime -> (double)

                                          mentary  Stream  (PES)  header. This
                                          parameter is effective only when the
                                          PCR  PID is the same as the video or
                                          audio elementary stream.

                                          transport  stream.  When no value is
                                          given, the encoder will  assign  the
                                          same  value as the Video PID. Can be
                                          entered as a decimal or  hexadecimal
                                          value.   Valid  values  are  32  (or

                                      SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                          The  segmentation  style   parameter
                                          controls  how  segmentation  markers
                                          are  inserted  into  the   transport
                                          stream.  With avails, it is possible
                                          that  segments  may  be   truncated,
                                          which  can  influence  where  future
                                          segmentation markers  are  inserted.
                                          When a segmentation style of "reset-
                                          Cadence" is selected and  a  segment
                                          is  truncated  due  to  an avail, we
                                          will reset the segmentation cadence.
                                          This  means  the  subsequent segment
                                          will have a duration  of  $segmenta-
                                          tionTime  seconds.  When a segmenta-
                                          tion style of  "maintainCadence"  is
                                          selected  and a segment is truncated
                                          due to an avail, we will  not  reset
                                          the segmentation cadence. This means
                                          the subsequent segment  will  likely
                                          be  truncated  as well. However, all
                                          segments  after  that  will  have  a
                                          duration  of  $segmentationTime sec-
                                          onds. Note that EBP lookahead  is  a
                                          slight exception to this rule.

                                   Error Correction on UDP outputs.

                                   ColumnDepth -> (integer)
                                      Parameter  D  from  SMPTE  2022-1.   The
                                      height of the FEC protection matrix. The
                                      number of transport stream  packets  per
                                      column  error correction packet. Must be
                                      between 4 and 20, inclusive.

                                   IncludeFec -> (string)
                                      Enables column only or  column  and  row

                                      between  1  and  20,  inclusive. If only
                                      Column FEC is used, then  larger  values
                                      increase robustness. If Row FEC is used,
                                      then this is  the  number  of  transport
                                      stream  packets per row error correction
                                      packet, and the value must be between  4
                                      and  20,  inclusive,  if  includeFec  is
                                      columnAndRow. If includeFec  is  column,

                            source for this output.

          TimecodeConfig -> (structure)
              Contains settings used to acquire and adjust  timecode  informa-
              tion from inputs.

                 ated with the events outputs. -Embedded (embedded):  Initial-
                 ize the output timecode with timecode from the the source. If
                 no embedded timecode is detected in the  source,  the  system
                 falls  back  to using "Start at 0" (zerobased). -System Clock
                 (systemclock): Use the UTC time. -Start at 0 (zerobased): The
                 time of the first frame of the event will be 00:00:00:00.

              SyncThreshold -> (integer)
                 Threshold  in  frames  beyond which output timecode is resyn-
                 chronized to the input  timecode.  Discrepancies  below  this
                 threshold  are permitted to avoid unnecessary discontinuities
                 in the output timecode. No timecode sync  when  this  is  not
                 specified.

                            inclusion in  the  output.  May  be  specified  in
                            either  seconds  or  milliseconds, as specified by
                            captureIntervalUnits.

                        H264 Settings

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Enables or disables adaptive  quantization,  which
                            is  a  technique MediaLive can apply to video on a
                            frame-by-frame basis to produce  more  compression
                            without  losing  quality. There are three types of
                            adaptive quantization: flicker, spatial, and  tem-
                            poral.  Set the field in one of these ways: Set to
                            Auto. Recommended. For each type of AQ,  MediaLive
                            will  determine  if  AQ  is needed, and if so, the
                            appropriate strength.  Set  a  strength  (a  value
                            other  than  Auto  or Disable). This strength will
                            apply to any of the AQ fields that you  choose  to
                            enable.  Set  to  Disabled to disable all types of
                            adaptive quantization.

                        AfdSignaling -> (string)
                            Indicates that AFD values will be written into the
                            output stream. If afdSignaling is "auto", the sys-
                            tem will try to preserve the input AFD  value  (in
                            cases where multiple AFD values are valid). If set
                            to "fixed", the AFD value will be the  value  con-
                            figured in the fixedAfd parameter.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Average  bitrate in bits/second. Required when the
                            rate control mode is VBR  or  CBR.  Not  used  for
                            QVBR.  In  an  MS Smooth output group, each output
                            must have a  unique  value  when  its  bitrate  is
                            rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1000.

                        BufFillPct -> (integer)
                            Percentage  of the buffer that should initially be
                            filled (HRD buffer model).

                        BufSize -> (integer)

                        ColorMetadata -> (string)
                            Includes colorspace metadata in the output.

                        ColorSpaceSettings -> (structure)

                            ColorSpacePassthroughSettings -> (structure)
                               Passthrough applies no color  space  conversion
                               to the output

                            Rec601Settings -> (structure)

                        EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                            Entropy  encoding mode. Use cabac (must be in Main
                            or High profile) or cavlc.

                        FilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Optional filters that you can apply to an  encode.

                            TemporalFilterSettings -> (structure)
                               Temporal Filter Settings

                               PostFilterSharpening -> (string)
                                   If  you enable this filter, the results are
                                   the following: - If the source  content  is
                                   noisy  (it contains excessive digital arti-
                                   facts), the filter cleans up the source.  -
                                   If the source content is already clean, the
                                   filter tends to decrease the bitrate, espe-
                                   cially  when the rate control mode is QVBR.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Choose a filter strength.  We  recommend  a
                                   strength of 1 or 2. A higher strength might
                                   take out good information, resulting in  an
                                   image that is overly soft.

                        FixedAfd -> (string)
                            Four bit AFD value to write on all frames of video
                            in the output stream. Only valid when afdSignaling
                            is set to 'Fixed'.

                        FlickerAq -> (string)
                            Flicker  AQ makes adjustments within each frame to
                            reduce flicker or 'pop' on I-frames. The value  to
                            enter  in  this  field depends on the value in the
                            Adaptive quantization field: If you have  set  the
                            Adaptive  quantization  field  to  Auto, MediaLive
                            ignores any value in this  field.  MediaLive  will
                            determine  if  flicker  AQ is appropriate and will
                            apply the appropriate strength. If  you  have  set
                            the Adaptive quantization field to a strength, you
                            can  set  this  field  to  Enabled  or   Disabled.
                            Enabled: MediaLive will apply flicker AQ using the
                            specified  strength.  Disabled:  MediaLive   won't
                            apply  flicker  AQ.  If  you have set the Adaptive
                            quantization to Disabled,  MediaLive  ignores  any
                            value  in this field and doesn't apply flicker AQ.

                        ForceFieldPictures -> (string)
                            This  setting  applies  only  when  scan  type  is
                            "interlaced."  It  controls whether coding is per-
                            formed on a field basis or on a frame basis. (When
                            the  video  is  progressive,  the coding is always
                            performed on a frame basis.) enabled: Force  Medi-
                            aLive  to  code  on a field basis, so that odd and
                            even sets of fields  are  coded  separately.  dis-
                            abled:  Code the two sets of fields separately (on
                            a field basis) or together (on a frame basis using
                            PAFF),  depending  on what is most appropriate for
                            the content.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            This field indicates how the  output  video  frame
                            rate is specified. If "specified" is selected then
                            the output video frame rate is determined by fram-
                            erateNumerator  and  framerateDenominator, else if
                            "initializeFromSource" is selected then the output
                            video  frame  rate  will be set equal to the input
                            video frame rate of the first input.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            Framerate denominator.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            Framerate numerator -  framerate  is  a  fraction,
                            e.g. 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.

                        GopBReference -> (string)
                            Documentation update needed

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Frequency  of  closed  GOPs. In streaming applica-
                            tions, it is recommended that this be set to 1  so
                            a  decoder  joining mid-stream will receive an IDR
                            frame as quickly as possible. Setting  this  value
                            to 0 will break output segmenting.

                        GopNumBFrames -> (integer)
                            Number of B-frames between reference frames.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            GOP  size  (keyframe  interval) in units of either
                            frames or seconds per gopSizeUnits.  If  gopSizeU-
                            nits  is  frames,  gopSize  must be an integer and
                            must be greater than or equal to 1.  If  gopSizeU-
                            nits  is  seconds, gopSize must be greater than 0,
                            but need not be an integer.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Indicates if the gopSize is specified in frames or
                            seconds.  If  seconds  the system will convert the
                            gopSize into a frame count at run time.

                        Level -> (string)
                            H.264 Level.

                        LookAheadRateControl -> (string)
                            Amount of lookahead. A value of low  can  decrease
                            latency  and  memory usage, while high can produce
                            better quality for certain content.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            For QVBR: See the tooltip for  Quality  level  For
                            VBR:  Set the maximum bitrate in order to accommo-
                            date expected spikes  in  the  complexity  of  the
                            video.

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Only  meaningful  if  sceneChangeDetect  is set to
                            enabled. Defaults to 5 if multiplex  rate  control
                            is  used.  Enforces  separation  between  repeated
                            (cadence) I-frames and I-frames inserted by  Scene
                            Change  Detection.  If  a  scene change I-frame is
                            within I-interval frames of a cadence I-frame, the
                            GOP is shrunk and/or stretched to the scene change
                            I-frame. GOP stretch requires  enabling  lookahead
                            as  well as setting I-interval. The normal cadence
                            resumes  for  the  next  GOP.  Note:  Maximum  GOP
                            stretch = GOP size + Min-I-interval - 1

                        NumRefFrames -> (integer)
                            Number of reference frames to use. The encoder may
                            use more than requested if using  B-frames  and/or
                            interlaced encoding.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            This  field  indicates how the output pixel aspect
                            ratio is specified.  If  "specified"  is  selected
                            then the output video pixel aspect ratio is deter-
                            mined by parNumerator and parDenominator, else  if
                            "initializeFromSource" is selected then the output
                            pixsel aspect ratio will be set equal to the input
                            video pixel aspect ratio of the first input.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Pixel Aspect Ratio denominator.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Pixel Aspect Ratio numerator.

                        Profile -> (string)
                            H.264 Profile.

                        QualityLevel -> (string)
                            Leave  as  STANDARD_QUALITY  or choose a different
                            value (which might result in additional  costs  to
                            run  the  channel). - ENHANCED_QUALITY: Produces a
                            slightly better video quality without an  increase
                            in  the  bitrate. Has an effect only when the Rate
                            control mode is QVBR or CBR. If this channel is in
                            a   MediaLive   multiplex,   the   value  must  be
                            ENHANCED_QUALITY. -  STANDARD_QUALITY:  Valid  for
                            any Rate control mode.

                        QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                            Controls  the target quality for the video encode.
                            Applies only when the rate control mode  is  QVBR.
                            You  can set a target quality or you can let Medi-
                            aLive determine the best quality. To set a  target
                            quality,  enter  values  in the QVBR quality level
                            field and the Max bitrate field. Enter values that
                            suit  your  most important viewing devices. Recom-
                            mended  values  are:  -  Primary  screen:  Quality
                            level:  8  to  10. Max bitrate: 4M - PC or tablet:
                            Quality level: 7. Max bitrate: 1.5M to 3M - Smart-
                            phone:  Quality  level: 6. Max bitrate: 1M to 1.5M
                            To let MediaLive decide, leave  the  QVBR  quality
                            level  field  empty,  and in Max bitrate enter the
                            maximum rate you  want  in  the  video.  For  more
                            information,  see the section called "Video - rate
                            control mode" in the MediaLive user guide

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Rate control mode. QVBR: Quality  will  match  the
                            specified  quality  level  except  when it is con-
                            strained by the maximum  bitrate.  Recommended  if
                            you  or your viewers pay for bandwidth. VBR: Qual-
                            ity and bitrate vary, depending on the video  com-
                            plexity.  Recommended  instead of QVBR if you want
                            to maintain a specific average  bitrate  over  the
                            duration  of  the  channel.  CBR:  Quality varies,
                            depending on  the  video  complexity.  Recommended
                            only if you distribute your assets to devices that
                            cannot handle variable bitrates.  Multiplex:  This
                            rate  control  mode  is  only  supported  (and  is
                            required) when the video is being delivered  to  a
                            MediaLive Multiplex in which case the rate control
                            configuration  is  controlled  by  the  properties
                            within the Multiplex Program.

                        ScanType -> (string)
                            Sets the scan type of the output to progressive or
                            top-field-first interlaced.

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Scene change detection.  -  On:  inserts  I-frames
                            when  scene  change  is  detected. - Off: does not
                            force an I-frame when scene change is detected.

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or
                            equal  to  the  number of macroblock rows for pro-
                            gressive pictures, and less than or equal to  half
                            the  number of macroblock rows for interlaced pic-
                            tures. This field is optional; when  no  value  is
                            specified  the  encoder  will choose the number of
                            slices based on encode resolution.

                        Softness -> (integer)
                            Softness. Selects quantizer matrix, larger  values
                            reduce   high-frequency  content  in  the  encoded
                            image. If not set to zero, must  be  greater  than
                            15.

                        SpatialAq -> (string)
                            Spatial  AQ  makes  adjustments  within each frame
                            based on spatial variation of content  complexity.
                            The  value  to  enter in this field depends on the
                            value in the Adaptive quantization field:  If  you
                            have  set the Adaptive quantization field to Auto,
                            MediaLive ignores any value in this  field.  Medi-
                            aLive  will determine if spatial AQ is appropriate
                            and will apply the appropriate  strength.  If  you
                            have  set  the  Adaptive  quantization  field to a
                            strength, you can set this  field  to  Enabled  or
                            Disabled. Enabled: MediaLive will apply spatial AQ
                            using the specified strength. Disabled:  MediaLive
                            won't  apply spatial AQ. If you have set the Adap-
                            tive quantization to Disabled,  MediaLive  ignores
                            any  value in this field and doesn't apply spatial
                            AQ.

                        SubgopLength -> (string)
                            If set to fixed, use  gopNumBFrames  B-frames  per
                            sub-GOP. If set to dynamic, optimize the number of
                            B-frames used for each sub-GOP to  improve  visual
                            quality.

                        Syntax -> (string)

                        TemporalAq -> (string)
                            Temporal makes adjustments within each frame based
                            on  temporal  variation of content complexity. The
                            value to enter in this field depends on the  value
                            in  the  Adaptive  quantization field: If you have
                            set the Adaptive quantization field to Auto, Medi-
                            aLive  ignores  any value in this field. MediaLive
                            will determine if temporal AQ is  appropriate  and
                            will  apply  the appropriate strength. If you have
                            set the Adaptive quantization field to a strength,
                            you  can  set  this  field to Enabled or Disabled.
                            Enabled: MediaLive will apply  temporal  AQ  using
                            the  specified strength. Disabled: MediaLive won't
                            apply temporal AQ. If you have  set  the  Adaptive
                            quantization  to  Disabled,  MediaLive ignores any
                            value in this field and doesn't apply temporal AQ.

                        TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                            Determines  how  timecodes should be inserted into
                            the video elementary stream. - 'disabled': Do  not
                            include  timecodes  - 'picTimingSei': Pass through
                            picture timing SEI messages from the source speci-
                            fied in Timecode Config

                            ers to vary to improve visual quality.

                        AfdSignaling -> (string)
                            Indicates that AFD values will be written into the
                            output stream. If afdSignaling is "auto", the sys-
                            tem will try to preserve the input AFD  value  (in
                            cases where multiple AFD values are valid). If set
                            to "fixed", the AFD value will be the  value  con-
                            figured in the fixedAfd parameter.

                        AlternativeTransferFunction -> (string)

                            Transfer Function SEI message to support backwards
                            compatibility  with non-HDR decoders and displays.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Average bitrate in bits/second. Required when  the
                            rate  control  mode  is  VBR  or CBR. Not used for
                            QVBR. In an MS Smooth output  group,  each  output
                            must  have  a  unique  value  when  its bitrate is
                            rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1000.

                        BufSize -> (integer)

                                   the following: - If the source  content  is
                                   noisy  (it contains excessive digital arti-
                                   facts), the filter cleans up the source.  -
                                   If the source content is already clean, the
                                   filter tends to decrease the bitrate, espe-
                                   cially  when the rate control mode is QVBR.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Choose a filter strength.  We  recommend  a
                                   strength of 1 or 2. A higher strength might
                                   take out good information, resulting in  an
                                   image that is overly soft.

                        FixedAfd -> (string)
                            Four bit AFD value to write on all frames of video
                            in the output stream. Only valid when afdSignaling
                            is set to 'Fixed'.

                        FlickerAq -> (string)
                            If set to enabled, adjust quantization within each
                            frame to reduce flicker or 'pop' on I-frames.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            Framerate denominator.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            Framerate numerator -  framerate  is  a  fraction,
                            e.g. 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Frequency  of  closed  GOPs. In streaming applica-
                            tions, it is recommended that this be set to 1  so
                            a  decoder  joining mid-stream will receive an IDR
                            frame as quickly as possible. Setting  this  value
                            to 0 will break output segmenting.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            GOP  size  (keyframe  interval) in units of either
                            frames or seconds per gopSizeUnits.  If  gopSizeU-
                            nits  is  frames,  gopSize  must be an integer and
                            must be greater than or equal to 1.  If  gopSizeU-
                            nits  is  seconds, gopSize must be greater than 0,
                            but need not be an integer.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Indicates if the gopSize is specified in frames or
                            seconds.  If  seconds  the system will convert the
                            gopSize into a frame count at run time.

                        Level -> (string)
                            H.265 Level.

                        LookAheadRateControl -> (string)
                            Amount of lookahead. A value of low  can  decrease
                            latency  and  memory usage, while high can produce
                            better quality for certain content.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            For QVBR: See the tooltip for Quality level

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Only meaningful if  sceneChangeDetect  is  set  to
                            enabled.  Defaults  to 5 if multiplex rate control
                            is  used.  Enforces  separation  between  repeated
                            (cadence)  I-frames and I-frames inserted by Scene
                            Change Detection. If a  scene  change  I-frame  is
                            within I-interval frames of a cadence I-frame, the
                            GOP is shrunk and/or stretched to the scene change
                            I-frame.  GOP  stretch requires enabling lookahead
                            as well as setting I-interval. The normal  cadence
                            resumes  for  the  next  GOP.  Note:  Maximum  GOP
                            stretch = GOP size + Min-I-interval - 1

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Pixel Aspect Ratio denominator.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Pixel Aspect Ratio numerator.

                        Profile -> (string)
                            H.265 Profile.

                        QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                            Controls the target quality for the video  encode.
                            Applies  only  when the rate control mode is QVBR.
                            Set values for the QVBR quality  level  field  and
                            Max  bitrate  field  that suit your most important
                            viewing devices. Recommended values are: - Primary
                            screen:  Quality level: 8 to 10. Max bitrate: 4M -
                            PC or tablet: Quality level: 7. Max bitrate:  1.5M

                            1M to 1.5M

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Rate control mode. QVBR: Quality  will  match  the
                            specified  quality  level  except  when it is con-
                            strained by the maximum  bitrate.  Recommended  if
                            you  or your viewers pay for bandwidth. CBR: Qual-
                            ity varies, depending  on  the  video  complexity.
                            Recommended  only if you distribute your assets to
                            devices that cannot handle variable bitrates. Mul-
                            tiplex:  This  rate control mode is only supported
                            (and is required) when the video is  being  deliv-
                            ered  to  a  MediaLive Multiplex in which case the
                            rate control configuration is  controlled  by  the
                            properties within the Multiplex Program.

                        ScanType -> (string)
                            Sets the scan type of the output to progressive or
                            top-field-first interlaced.

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Scene change detection.

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or
                            equal  to  the  number of macroblock rows for pro-
                            gressive pictures, and less than or equal to  half
                            the  number of macroblock rows for interlaced pic-
                            tures. This field is optional; when  no  value  is
                            specified  the  encoder  will choose the number of
                            slices based on encode resolution.

                        Tier -> (string)
                            H.265 Tier.

                        TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                            Determines how timecodes should be  inserted  into
                            the  video elementary stream. - 'disabled': Do not
                            include timecodes - 'picTimingSei':  Pass  through
                            picture timing SEI messages from the source speci-
                            fied in Timecode Config

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Choose Off to disable  adaptive  quantization.  Or
                            choose  another  value to enable the quantizer and
                            set its strength. The strengths  are:  Auto,  Off,
                            Low,  Medium,  High.  When  you enable this field,
                            MediaLive allows intra-frame quantizers  to  vary,
                            which might improve visual quality.

                        AfdSignaling -> (string)
                            Indicates the AFD values that MediaLive will write
                            into the video encode. If you do not know what AFD
                            signaling is, or if your downstream system has not
                            given you guidance, choose AUTO.  AUTO:  MediaLive
                            will try to preserve the input AFD value (in cases
                            where multiple AFD values are valid). FIXED: Medi-
                            aLive  will use the value you specify in fixedAFD.

                        ColorMetadata -> (string)
                            Specifies whether to include the color space meta-
                            data.  The metadata describes the color space that
                            applies to the video (the  colorSpace  field).  We
                            recommend that you insert the metadata.

                        ColorSpace -> (string)
                            Choose the type of color space conversion to apply
                            to the output. For detailed information on setting
                            up  both  the  input  and the output to obtain the
                            desired color space in the output, see the section
                            on  "MediaLive  Features - Video - color space" in
                            the MediaLive User Guide.  PASSTHROUGH:  Keep  the
                            color  space of the input content - do not convert
                            it. AUTO:Convert all content that  is  SD  to  rec
                            601,  and  convert  all  content that is HD to rec
                            709.

                        DisplayAspectRatio -> (string)
                            Sets the pixel aspect ratio for the encode.

                        FilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Optionally specify a noise reduction filter, which
                            can  improve quality of compressed content. If you
                            do not choose a filter, no filter will be applied.
                            TEMPORAL:  This  filter  is useful for both source
                            content that is noisy (when it has excessive digi-
                            tal  artifacts)  and source content that is clean.
                            When the content is noisy, the  filter  cleans  up
                            the source content before the encoding phase, with
                            these two effects: First, it improves  the  output
                            video quality because the content has been cleaned
                            up. Secondly, it decreases the  bandwidth  because
                            MediaLive  does  not waste bits on encoding noise.
                            When the content is reasonably clean,  the  filter
                            tends to decrease the bitrate.

                               PostFilterSharpening -> (string)
                                   If  you enable this filter, the results are
                                   the following: - If the source  content  is
                                   noisy  (it contains excessive digital arti-
                                   facts), the filter cleans up the source.  -
                                   If the source content is already clean, the
                                   filter tends to decrease the bitrate, espe-
                                   cially  when the rate control mode is QVBR.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Choose a filter strength.  We  recommend  a
                                   strength of 1 or 2. A higher strength might
                                   take out good information, resulting in  an
                                   image that is overly soft.

                        FixedAfd -> (string)
                            Complete  this field only when afdSignaling is set
                            to FIXED. Enter the AFD value (4 bits) to write on
                            all frames of the video encode.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            description":   "The  framerate  denominator.  For
                            example, 1001.  The  framerate  is  the  numerator
                            divided  by  the denominator. For example, 24000 /
                            1001 = 23.976 FPS.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            The framerate numerator. For example,  24000.  The
                            framerate  is the numerator divided by the denomi-
                            nator. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 FPS.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            MPEG2: default is open GOP.

                        GopNumBFrames -> (integer)
                            Relates  to  the  GOP  structure.  The  number  of
                            B-frames  between  reference frames. If you do not
                            know what a B-frame is, use the default.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Relates  to  the  GOP  structure.  The  GOP   size
                            (keyframe interval) in the units specified in gop-
                            SizeUnits. If you do not know what GOP is, use the
                            default.  If gopSizeUnits is frames, then the gop-
                            Size must be an integer and must be  greater  than
                            or  equal  to  1.  If gopSizeUnits is seconds, the
                            gopSize must be greater than 0, but does not  need
                            to be an integer.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Relates  to  the  GOP structure. Specifies whether
                            the gopSize is specified in frames or seconds.  If
                            you  do  not  plan  to change the default gopSize,
                            leave the default. If you specify  SECONDS,  Medi-
                            aLive  will  internally  convert the gop size to a
                            frame count.

                        ScanType -> (string)
                            Set the scan type of the output to PROGRESSIVE  or
                            INTERLACED (top field first).

                        SubgopLength -> (string)
                            Relates  to  the GOP structure. If you do not know
                            what GOP is, use the default. FIXED: Set the  num-
                            ber  of  B-frames  in each sub-GOP to the value in
                            gopNumBFrames. DYNAMIC: Let MediaLive optimize the
                            number  of  B-frames  in  each sub-GOP, to improve
                            visual quality.

                        TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                            Determines how MediaLive inserts timecodes in  the
                            output  video. For detailed information about set-
                            ting up the input and the output for  a  timecode,
                            see  the section on "MediaLive Features - Timecode
                            configuration" in the MediaLive User  Guide.  DIS-
                            ABLED:  do  not  include  timecodes. GOP_TIMECODE:
                            Include timecode metadata in the GOP header.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     Output video height, in pixels. Must be an  even  number.
                     For most codecs, you can leave this field and width blank
                     in order to use the height and  width  (resolution)  from
                     the source. Note, however, that leaving blank is not rec-
                     ommended. For the Frame Capture codec, height  and  width
                     are required.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name of this VideoDescription. Outputs will use this
                     name to uniquely identify this  Description.  Description
                     names should be unique within this Live Event.

                 RespondToAfd -> (string)
                     Indicates  how  MediaLive  will respond to the AFD values
                     that might be in the input video. If you do not know what
                     AFD  signaling  is,  or if your downstream system has not
                     given you guidance, choose  PASSTHROUGH.  RESPOND:  Medi-
                     aLive clips the input video using a formula that uses the
                     AFD values (configured in afdSignaling ), the input  dis-
                     play  aspect  ratio, and the output display aspect ratio.
                     MediaLive also includes the AFD  values  in  the  output,
                     unless  the  codec  for  this  encode  is  FRAME_CAPTURE.
                     PASSTHROUGH: MediaLive ignores the AFD  values  and  does
                     not clip the video. But MediaLive does include the values
                     in the output. NONE: MediaLive does not  clip  the  input
                     video and does not include the AFD values in the output

                 ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                     STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT   configures  the  output  position  to
                     stretch the video  to  the  specified  output  resolution
                     (height  and  width). This option will override any posi-
                     tion value. DEFAULT may insert black boxes (pillar  boxes
                     or  letter  boxes) around the video to provide the speci-
                     fied output resolution.

                 Sharpness -> (integer)
                     Changes the strength of the anti-alias  filter  used  for
                     scaling. 0 is the softest setting, 100 is the sharpest. A
                     setting of 50 is recommended for most content.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     Output video width, in pixels. Must be  an  even  number.
                     For  most  codecs,  you  can  leave this field and height
                     blank in order to use the height and  width  (resolution)
                     from the source. Note, however, that leaving blank is not
                     recommended. For the  Frame  Capture  codec,  height  and
                     width are required.

       Id -> (string)
          The unique id of the channel.

       InputAttachments -> (list)
          List of input attachments for channel.

          (structure)
              Placeholder documentation for InputAttachment

              AutomaticInputFailoverSettings -> (structure)
                 User-specified  settings for defining what the conditions are
                 for declaring the input unhealthy and failing over to a  dif-
                 ferent input.

                 ErrorClearTimeMsec -> (integer)
                     This clear time defines the requirement a recovered input
                     must meet to be considered healthy. The input  must  have
                     no  failover  conditions for this length of time. Enter a
                     time in milliseconds. This value is  particularly  impor-
                     tant if the input_preference for the failover pair is set
                     to  PRIMARY_INPUT_PREFERRED,  because  after  this  time,
                     MediaLive will switch back to the primary input.

                 FailoverConditions -> (list)
                     A list of failover conditions. If any of these conditions
                     occur, MediaLive will perform a  failover  to  the  other
                     input.

                     (structure)
                        Failover  Condition  settings.  There  can be multiple
                        failover conditions inside  AutomaticInputFailoverSet-
                        tings.

                        FailoverConditionSettings -> (structure)
                            Failover condition type-specific settings.

                            AudioSilenceSettings -> (structure)
                               MediaLive will perform a failover if the speci-
                               fied audio selector is silent for the specified
                               period.

                               AudioSelectorName -> (string)
                                   The name of the audio selector in the input
                                   that MediaLive  should  monitor  to  detect
                                   silence.  Select your most important rendi-
                                   tion. If you didn't create an audio  selec-
                                   tor in this input, leave blank.

                               AudioSilenceThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                   The  amount  of time (in milliseconds) that
                                   the active  input  must  be  silent  before
                                   automatic input failover occurs. Silence is
                                   defined as audio loss or audio quieter than
                                   -50 dBFS.

                            InputLossSettings -> (structure)
                               MediaLive will perform a failover if content is
                               not detected in this input  for  the  specified
                               period.

                               InputLossThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                   The  amount  of time (in milliseconds) that
                                   no input is detected. After that  time,  an
                                   input failover will occur.

                            VideoBlackSettings -> (structure)
                               MediaLive will perform a failover if content is
                               considered black for the specified period.

                               BlackDetectThreshold -> (double)
                                   A value used in calculating  the  threshold
                                   below  which MediaLive considers a pixel to
                                   be 'black'. For the input to be  considered
                                   black, every pixel in a frame must be below
                                   this threshold. The threshold is calculated
                                   as a percentage (expressed as a decimal) of
                                   white. Therefore .1 means 10% white (or 90%
                                   black).  Note how the formula works for any
                                   color depth. For example, if you  set  this
                                   field   to   0.1  in  10-bit  color  depth:
                                   (1023*0.1=102.3), which means a pixel value
                                   of  102 or less is 'black'. If you set this
                                   field  to  .1  in  an  8-bit  color  depth:
                                   (255*0.1=25.5),  which  means a pixel value
                                   of 25 or less is 'black'. The range is  0.0
                                   to  1.0, with any number of decimal places.

                               VideoBlackThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                   The amount of time (in  milliseconds)  that
                                   the active input must be black before auto-
                                   matic input failover occurs.

                 InputPreference -> (string)
                     Input preference when deciding which input to make active
                     when a previously failed input has recovered.

                 SecondaryInputId -> (string)
                     The  input  ID  of  the  secondary input in the automatic
                     input failover pair.

              InputAttachmentName -> (string)
                 User-specified name for the attachment. This is  required  if
                 the user wants to use this input in an input switch action.

              InputId -> (string)
                 The ID of the input

              InputSettings -> (structure)
                 Settings of an input (caption selector, etc.)

                 AudioSelectors -> (list)
                     Used to select the audio stream to decode for inputs that
                     have multiple available.

                     (structure)
                        Audio Selector

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of this AudioSelector.  AudioDescriptions
                            will  use  this  name  to  uniquely  identify this
                            Selector. Selector  names  should  be  unique  per
                            input.

                        SelectorSettings -> (structure)
                            The audio selector settings.

                                   tag of the target HLS audio rendition.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   Specifies the NAME in the #EXT-X-MEDIA  tag
                                   of the target HLS audio rendition.

                            AudioLanguageSelection -> (structure)
                               Audio Language Selection

                               LanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Selects  a  specific  three-letter language
                                   code from within an audio source.

                               LanguageSelectionPolicy -> (string)
                                   When set to "strict", the transport  stream
                                   demux  strictly identifies audio streams by
                                   their language descriptor. If a PMT  update
                                   occurs  such  that an audio stream matching
                                   the  initially  selected  language  is   no
                                   longer  present  then  mute will be encoded
                                   until the  language  returns.  If  "loose",
                                   then  on a PMT update the demux will choose
                                   another audio stream in  the  program  with
                                   the  same  stream type if it can't find one
                                   with the same language.

                            AudioPidSelection -> (structure)
                               Audio Pid Selection

                     have multiple available.

                     (structure)
                        Output groups for this Live Event. Output groups  con-
                        tain  information  about  where streams should be dis-

                                      See the description in  leftOffset.  For
                                      height, specify the entire height of the
                                      rectangle as a percentage of the  under-
                                      lying  frame  height.  For example, "80"
                                      means the rectangle height is 80% of the
                                      underlying  frame  height. The topOffset
                                      and rectangleHeight must add up to  100%
                                      or   less.  This  field  corresponds  to

                                      these  source  captions  to  EBU-TT-D or
                                      TTML in an output. (Make sure  to  leave
                                      the  default if you don't have either of
                                      these formats in the  output.)  You  can
                                      define  a display rectangle for the cap-
                                      tions that is smaller than the  underly-
                                      ing  video frame. You define the rectan-
                                      gle by specifying the  position  of  the
                                      left  edge,  top  edge, bottom edge, and
                                      right edge of the rectangle, all  within
                                      the  underlying  video  frame. The units
                                      for the measurements are percentages. If
                                      you  specify  a  value  for one of these
                                      fields, you must specify a value for all
                                      of  them.  For  leftOffset,  specify the
                                      position of the left edge of the rectan-
                                      gle,  as  a percentage of the underlying
                                      frame width, and relative  to  the  left
                                      edge  of  the  frame.  For example, "10"
                                      means the  measurement  is  10%  of  the
                                      underlying  frame  width.  The rectangle
                                      left edge starts at that  position  from
                                      the  left  edge of the frame. This field
                                      corresponds to tts:origin  -  X  in  the
                                      TTML standard.

                                   TopOffset -> (double)
                                      See  the  description in leftOffset. For
                                      topOffset, specify the position  of  the
                                      top edge of the rectangle, as a percent-
                                      age of the underlying frame height,  and
                                      relative  to  the top edge of the frame.
                                      For example, "10" means the  measurement
                                      is  10%  of the underlying frame height.
                                      The rectangle top edge  starts  at  that
                                      position from the top edge of the frame.
                                      This field corresponds to tts:origin - Y
                                      in the TTML standard.

                                      See  the  description in leftOffset. For
                                      width, specify the entire width  of  the
                                      rectangle  as a percentage of the under-
                                      lying frame  width.  For  example,  "80"
                                      means  the rectangle width is 80% of the
                                      underlying frame width.  The  leftOffset
                                      and  rectangleWidth  must add up to 100%
                                      or  less.  This  field  corresponds   to

                            the m3u8 will be chosen. The bitrate is  specified
                            in bits per second, as in an HLS manifest.

                        BufferSegments -> (integer)
                            When  specified,  reading  of  the  HLS input will
                            begin this many buffer segments from the end (most
                            recently written segment). When not specified, the
                            HLS input will begin with the first segment speci-
                            fied in the m3u8.

                        Retries -> (integer)

                            read a manifest or segment must  fail  before  the
                            input is considered unavailable.

                        RetryInterval -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  seconds  between  retries when an
                            attempt to read a manifest or segment fails.

                        Scte35Source -> (string)
                            Identifies the source  for  the  SCTE-35  messages
                            that   MediaLive  will  ingest.  Messages  can  be
                            ingested from the content segments (in the stream)
                            or  from  tags in the playlist (the HLS manifest).
                            MediaLive  ignores  SCTE-35  information  in   the
                            source that is not selected.

                     ServerValidation -> (string)
                        Check  HTTPS  server  certificates. When set to check-
                        CryptographyOnly, cryptography in the certificate will
                        be  checked, but not the server's name. Certain subdo-
                        mains (notably S3 buckets that use dots in the  bucket
                        name) do not strictly match the corresponding certifi-
                        cate's wildcard pattern and would otherwise cause  the
                        event  to error. This setting is ignored for protocols
                        that do not use https.

                 Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                     PID from which to read SCTE-35 messages.  If  left  unde-
                     fined, EML will select the first SCTE-35 PID found in the
                     input.

                 Smpte2038DataPreference -> (string)
                     Specifies whether to extract  applicable  ancillary  data
                     from  a  SMPTE-2038 source in this input. Applicable data
                     types are captions, timecode, AFD, and SCTE-104 messages.
                     -  PREFER:  Extract  from  SMPTE-2038  if present in this
                     input, otherwise extract from another source (if any).  -
                     IGNORE: Never extract any ancillary data from SMPTE-2038.

                 SourceEndBehavior -> (string)

                     ColorSpace -> (string)
                        Specifies the color space of an  input.  This  setting
                        works  in  tandem  with  colorSpaceUsage  and  a video
                        description's colorSpaceSettingsChoice to determine if
                        any conversion will be performed.

                               nits, of any single pixel within an encoded HDR
                               video stream or file.

                               light level, in  nits,  for  any  single  frame
                               within an encoded HDR video stream or file.

                     ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                        Applies  only if colorSpace is a value other than fol-
                        low. This field controls how the  value  in  the  col-
                        orSpace  field  will be used. fallback means that when
                        the input does include color  space  data,  that  data
                        will  be  used,  but when the input has no color space
                        data, the value in colorSpace  will  be  used.  Choose
                        fallback  if  your  input  is  sometimes missing color
                        space data, but when it does have  color  space  data,
                        that  data  is  correct. force means to always use the
                        value in colorSpace. Choose force if your  input  usu-
                        ally  has no color space data or might have unreliable
                        color space data.
