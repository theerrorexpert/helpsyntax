       ture)

       --media-connect-flows (list) A list of the MediaConnect Flow ARNs  that
       you  want  to use as the source of the input. You can specify as few as
       one Flow and presently, as many as two. The only  requirement  is  when
       you  have more than one is that each Flow is in a separate Availability
       Zone as this ensures your EML input is redundant to AZ issues.  (struc-
       ture)

          FlowArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the  MediaConnect  Flow  that you want to use as a

       input assumes during and after creation.

       --sources (list) The source URLs for a PULL-type input. Every PULL type
       input needs exactly  two  source  URLs  for  redundancy.  Only  specify
       sources for PULL type Inputs. Leave Destinations empty. (structure)
          Settings for for a PULL type input.

          PasswordParam -> (string)
              The key used to extract the password from EC2 Parameter store.

          Url -> (string)
              This represents the customer's source URL where stream is pulled
              from.

          Username -> (string)
              The username for the input source.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PasswordParam=string,Url=string,Username=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 Placeholder documentation for __string

                 Ip -> (string)
                     The  system-generated  static  IP address of endpoint. It
                     remains fixed for the lifetime of the input.

                 Port -> (string)
                     The port number for the input.

                 Url -> (string)
                     This represents the endpoint  that  the  customer  stream
                     will be pushed to.

                 Vpc -> (structure)
                     The properties for a VPC type input destination.

                     AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                        The availability zone of the Input destination.

                     NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                        The  network  interface ID of the Input destination in
                        the VPC.

          Id -> (string)
              The  generated  ID  of  the  input  (unique  for  user  account,
              immutable).

          InputClass -> (string)
              STANDARD - MediaLive expects two sources to be connected to this
              input. If the channel is also STANDARD,  both  sources  will  be
              ingested.  If  the  channel  is  SINGLE_PIPELINE, only the first
              source will be  ingested;  the  second  source  will  always  be
              ignored,  even  if the first source fails. SINGLE_PIPELINE - You
              can connect only one source to this input. If  the  ChannelClass
              is  also  SINGLE_PIPELINE,  this value is valid. If the Channel-
              Class is STANDARD, this value is not valid because  the  channel
              requires two sources in the input.

              Certain pull input sources can be dynamic, meaning that they can
              have  their  URL's  dynamically  changes  during  input   switch
              actions.  Presently, this functionality only works with MP4_FILE
              and TS_FILE inputs.
