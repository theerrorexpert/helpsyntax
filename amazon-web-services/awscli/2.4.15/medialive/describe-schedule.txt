NAME
       describe-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Get a channel schedule

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-schedule  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ScheduleActions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-schedule
          --channel-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-id (string)  Id  of  the  channel  whose  schedule  is  being
       updated.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The next token; for use in pagination.

       ScheduleActions -> (list)
          The list of actions in the schedule.

          (structure)
              Contains information on a single schedule action.

              ActionName -> (string)
                 The name of the action, must be unique within  the  schedule.
                 This name provides the main reference to an action once it is
                 added to the schedule. A name is unique if it is no longer in
                 the  schedule.  The  schedule  is automatically cleaned up to
                 remove actions with a start time of  more  than  1  hour  ago
                 (approximately) so at that point a name can be reused.

              ScheduleActionSettings -> (structure)
                 Settings for this schedule action.

                 HlsId3SegmentTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                     Action to insert HLS ID3 segment tagging

                     Tag -> (string)

                        keyword identifiers to substitute  in  segment-related
                        values.nSupported         keyword         identifiers:
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/medialive/latest/ug/variable-data-identifiers.html

                        The  duration  in milliseconds for the image to remain
                        on the video. If omitted or set to 0 the  duration  is
                        unlimited  and  the  image  will  remain  until  it is
                        explicitly deactivated.

                     FadeIn -> (integer)
                        The time in milliseconds for the image to fade in. The
                        fade-in  starts  at  the  start  time  of the overlay.

                        milliseconds  for  the image to fade out. The fade-out
                        starts when the duration time is  hit,  so  it  effec-
                        tively   extends   the  duration.  Default  is  0  (no
                        fade-out).

                        The height of the image when inserted into the  video,
                        in  pixels.  The  overlay will be scaled up or down to
                        the specified height. Leave blank to  use  the  native
                        height of the overlay.

                        default)  is the left edge of the frame. If the place-
                        ment causes the overlay to  extend  beyond  the  right
                        edge  of  the  underlying  video,  then the overlay is
                        cropped on the right.

                     ImageY -> (integer)
                        Placement of the top edge of the overlay  relative  to

                        default) is the top edge of the frame. If  the  place-
                        ment  causes  the  overlay to extend beyond the bottom
                        edge of the underlying  video,  then  the  overlay  is
                        cropped on the bottom.

                        different  image.  The  layers  are  in Z order, which
                        means that overlays with higher values  of  layer  are
                        inserted  on  top  of  overlays  with  lower values of
                        layer. Default is 0.

                     Opacity -> (integer)
                        Opacity of image where 0 is  transparent  and  100  is

                     Width -> (integer)
                        The  width  of the image when inserted into the video,
                        in pixels. The overlay will be scaled up  or  down  to
                        the  specified  width.  Leave  blank to use the native
                        width of the overlay.
