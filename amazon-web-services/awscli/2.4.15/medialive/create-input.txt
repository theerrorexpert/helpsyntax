       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create an input

       The following create-input example creates an HLS PULL input by passing
       in  a JSON file that contains the parameters that apply to this type of
       input.  The  JSON  for  this  example  input  specifies   two   sources
       (addresses) to the input, in order to support redundancy in the ingest.
       These addresses require passwords.

          aws medialive create-input \
              --cli-input-json file://input-hls-pull-news.json

       Contents of input-hls-pull-news.json:

          {
              "Name": "local_news",
              "RequestId": "cli000059",
              "Sources": [
                      {
                              "Url": "https://203.0.113.13/newschannel/anytownusa.m3u8",
                              "Username": "examplecorp",
                              "PasswordParam": "/medialive/examplecorp1"
                      },
                 {
                              "Url": "https://198.51.100.54/fillervideos/oceanwaves.mp4",
                              "Username": "examplecorp",
                              "PasswordParam": "examplecorp2"
                      }
              ],
              "Type": "URL_PULL"
          }

       Output:

       The output repeats back the contents of the JSON file, plus the follow-
       ing values. All parameters are ordered alphabetically.

       o Arn for the input. The last part of the ARN is the unique input ID.

       o Attached Channels, which is always empty for a newly created input.

       o Destinations,  which is empty in this example because it is used only
         with a PUSH input.

       o Id for the input, the same as the ID in the ARN.

       o MediaConnectFlows, which is empty in this example because it is  used
         only with an input of type MediaConnect.

       o SecurityGroups,  which  is  empty  in this example because it is used
         only with a PUSH input.

       o State of this input.

       o Tags, which is empty (the default for this parameter).

          AttachedChannels -> (list)
              A  list of channel IDs that that input is attached to (currently
              an input can only be attached to one channel).

              (string)
                 Placeholder documentation for __string

          Destinations -> (list)
              A list of the destinations of the input (PUSH-type).

              (structure)
                 The settings for a PUSH type input.

                 Ip -> (string)
                     The system-generated static IP address  of  endpoint.  It
                     remains fixed for the lifetime of the input.

                 Port -> (string)
                     The port number for the input.

                 Url -> (string)
                     This  represents  the  endpoint  that the customer stream
                     will be pushed to.

                 Vpc -> (structure)
                     The properties for a VPC type input destination.

                     AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                        The availability zone of the Input destination.

                     NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                        The network interface ID of the Input  destination  in
                        the VPC.

          Id -> (string)
              The  generated  ID  of  the  input  (unique  for  user  account,
              immutable).

          InputClass -> (string)
              STANDARD - MediaLive expects two sources to be connected to this
              input.  If  the  channel  is also STANDARD, both sources will be
              ingested. If the channel  is  SINGLE_PIPELINE,  only  the  first
              source  will  be  ingested;  the  second  source  will always be
              ignored, even if the first source fails. SINGLE_PIPELINE  -  You
              can  connect  only one source to this input. If the ChannelClass
              is also SINGLE_PIPELINE, this value is valid.  If  the  Channel-
              Class  is  STANDARD, this value is not valid because the channel
              requires two sources in the input.

          InputDevices -> (list)
              Settings for the input devices.

              (structure)
                 Settings for an input device.

              Certain pull input sources can be dynamic, meaning that they can
              have   their  URL's  dynamically  changes  during  input  switch
              actions. Presently, this functionality only works with  MP4_FILE
              and TS_FILE inputs.
