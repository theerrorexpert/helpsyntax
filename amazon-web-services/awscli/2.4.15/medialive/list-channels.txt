LIST-CHANNELS()                                                LIST-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Produces list of channels that have been created

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-channels  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Channels

SYNOPSIS
            list-channels
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Destinations -> (list)
                 A list of destinations of the channel. For UDP outputs, there
                 is one destination per output.  For  other  types  (HLS,  for
                 example), there is one destination per packager.

                               need to specify the individual inputs in Media-
                               Package; MediaLive will handle  the  connection
                               of the two MediaLive pipelines to the two Medi-
                               aPackage inputs. The MediaPackage  channel  and
                               MediaLive channel must be in the same region.

                            individual inputs to the Multiplex; MediaLive will
                            handle  the  connection of the two MediaLive pipe-
                            lines to the two Multiplex instances.  The  Multi-
                            plex must be in the same region as the Channel.

                        ProgramName -> (string)
                            The program name of the Multiplex program that the

                               Parameter store

                            StreamName -> (string)
                               Stream name for RTMP destinations (URLs of type
                               rtmp://)

                            Url -> (string)

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique id of the channel.

              InputAttachments -> (list)
                 List of input attachments for channel.

                     AutomaticInputFailoverSettings -> (structure)
                        User-specified settings for defining what  the  condi-
                        tions  are for declaring the input unhealthy and fail-
                        ing over to a different input.

                        ErrorClearTimeMsec -> (integer)
                            This clear time defines the requirement  a  recov-
                            ered input must meet to be considered healthy. The
                            input must have no failover  conditions  for  this
                            length of time. Enter a time in milliseconds. This
                            value is particularly important if the input_pref-
                            erence  for  the  failover  pair  is  set  to PRI-
                            MARY_INPUT_PREFERRED,  because  after  this  time,
                            MediaLive will switch back to the primary input.

                        FailoverConditions -> (list)
                            A  list  of  failover  conditions. If any of these
                            conditions  occur,  MediaLive   will   perform   a
                            failover to the other input.

                            (structure)
                               Failover  Condition settings. There can be mul-
                               tiple failover conditions  inside  AutomaticIn-
                               putFailoverSettings.

                               FailoverConditionSettings -> (structure)
                                   Failover  condition type-specific settings.

                                   AudioSilenceSettings -> (structure)
                                      MediaLive will perform a failover if the
                                      specified  audio  selector is silent for
                                      the specified period.

                                      AudioSelectorName -> (string)
                                          The name of the  audio  selector  in
                                          the input that MediaLive should mon-
                                          itor to detect silence. Select  your
                                          most  important  rendition.  If  you
                                          didn't create an audio  selector  in
                                          this input, leave blank.

                                      AudioSilenceThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                          The amount of time (in milliseconds)
                                          that the active input must be silent
                                          before   automatic   input  failover
                                          occurs. Silence is defined as  audio
                                          loss or audio quieter than -50 dBFS.

                                   InputLossSettings -> (structure)
                                      MediaLive will  perform  a  failover  if
                                      content  is  not  detected in this input
                                      for the specified period.

                                      InputLossThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                          The amount of time (in milliseconds)
                                          that  no  input  is  detected. After
                                          that time, an  input  failover  will
                                          occur.

                                   VideoBlackSettings -> (structure)
                                      MediaLive  will  perform  a  failover if
                                      content  is  considered  black  for  the
                                      specified period.

                                      BlackDetectThreshold -> (double)
                                          A  value  used  in  calculating  the
                                          threshold below which MediaLive con-
                                          siders  a  pixel  to be 'black'. For
                                          the input to  be  considered  black,
                                          every pixel in a frame must be below
                                          this  threshold.  The  threshold  is
                                          calculated     as    a    percentage
                                          (expressed as a decimal)  of  white.
                                          Therefore .1 means 10% white (or 90%
                                          black). Note how the  formula  works
                                          for any color depth. For example, if
                                          you set this field to 0.1 in  10-bit
                                          color depth: (1023*0.1=102.3), which
                                          means a pixel value of 102  or  less
                                          is 'black'. If you set this field to
                                          .1  in   an   8-bit   color   depth:
                                          (255*0.1=25.5),  which means a pixel
                                          value of 25 or less is 'black'.  The
                                          range is 0.0 to 1.0, with any number
                                          of decimal places.

                                      VideoBlackThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                          The amount of time (in milliseconds)
                                          that  the active input must be black
                                          before  automatic   input   failover
                                          occurs.

                        InputPreference -> (string)
                            Input preference when deciding which input to make
                            active when a previously failed input  has  recov-
                            ered.

                        SecondaryInputId -> (string)
                            The  input  ID of the secondary input in the auto-
                            matic input failover pair.

                     InputAttachmentName -> (string)
                        User-specified  name  for  the  attachment.  This   is
                        required  if  the  user  wants to use this input in an
                        input switch action.

                     InputId -> (string)
                        The ID of the input

                     InputSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings of an input (caption selector, etc.)

                        AudioSelectors -> (list)
                            Used to select the  audio  stream  to  decode  for
                            inputs that have multiple available.

                            (structure)
                               Audio Selector

                               Name -> (string)

                                             ments  are  percentages.  If  you

                                             fields,  you must specify a value
                                             for all of them. For  leftOffset,
                                             specify  the position of the left
                                             edge of the rectangle, as a  per-

                                             edge  of  the frame. For example,
                                             "10" means the measurement is 10%
                                             of  the  underlying  frame width.
                                             The rectangle left edge starts at

                               the value in colorSpace. Choose force  if  your
                               input  usually has no color space data or might
                               have unreliable color space data.
