OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source HDFS cluster  location.

       --subdirectory (string)
          A  subdirectory  in  the  HDFS cluster. This subdirectory is used to
          read data from or write data to the HDFS cluster.

       --name-nodes (list)
          The NameNode that manages the HDFS namespace. The NameNode  performs
          operations such as opening, closing, and renaming files and directo-
          ries. The NameNode contains the information to map blocks of data to
          the DataNodes. You can use only one NameNode.

          (structure)
              The  NameNode  of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The
              NameNode manages the file system's namespace. The NameNode  per-
              forms  operations  such  as opening, closing, and renaming files
              and directories. The NameNode contains the  information  to  map
              blocks of data to the DataNodes.

              Hostname -> (string)
                 The  hostname of the NameNode in the HDFS cluster. This value
                 is the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS)  name  of  the
                 NameNode.  An  agent  that's  installed on-premises uses this
                 hostname to communicate with the NameNode in the network.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port that the NameNode uses to listen to client requests.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Hostname=string,Port=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Hostname": "string",
              "Port": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --block-size (integer)
          The size of the data blocks to write into the HDFS cluster.

       --replication-factor (integer)
          The number of DataNodes to replicate the data to when writing to the
          HDFS cluster.

       --kms-key-provider-uri (string)
          The URI of the HDFS cluster's Key Management Server (KMS).

       --qop-configuration (structure)
          The Quality of Protection (QOP) configuration specifies  the  Remote
          Procedure  Call  (RPC) and data transfer privacy settings configured
          on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) cluster.

          RpcProtection -> (string)
              The RPC protection setting configured on the HDFS cluster.  This
              setting  corresponds  to  your  hadoop.rpc.protection setting in
              your core-site.xml file on your Hadoop cluster.

          DataTransferProtection -> (string)
              The data transfer protection  setting  configured  on  the  HDFS
              cluster. This setting corresponds to your dfs.data.transfer.pro-
              tection setting in the hdfs-site.xml file on your  Hadoop  clus-
              ter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RpcProtection=string,DataTransferProtection=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RpcProtection": "DISABLED"|"AUTHENTICATION"|"INTEGRITY"|"PRIVACY",
            "DataTransferProtection": "DISABLED"|"AUTHENTICATION"|"INTEGRITY"|"PRIVACY"
          }

       --authentication-type (string)
          The  type  of  authentication  used to determine the identity of the
          user.

          Possible values:

          o SIMPLE

          o KERBEROS

       --simple-user (string)
          The user name used to identify the client on the host operating sys-
          tem.

       --kerberos-principal (string)
          The  Kerberos  principal with access to the files and folders on the
          HDFS cluster.

       --kerberos-keytab (blob)
          The Kerberos key table (keytab) that contains mappings  between  the
          defined  Kerberos principal and the encrypted keys. You can load the
          keytab from a file by providing the file's address. If you  use  the
          AWS CLI, it performs base64 encoding for you. Otherwise, provide the
          base64-encoded text.

       --kerberos-krb5-conf (blob)
          The krb5.conf file that contains the Kerberos configuration informa-
          tion.  You  can  load  the  krb5.conf  file  by providing the file's
          address. If you're using the AWS CLI, it performs the base64  encod-
          ing for you. Otherwise, provide the base64-encoded text.

       --agent-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the agents that are used to connect to the HDFS cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
