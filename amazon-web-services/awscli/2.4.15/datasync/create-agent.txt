CREATE-AGENT()                                                  CREATE-AGENT()



NAME
       create-agent -

DESCRIPTION
       Activates  an  DataSync  agent that you have deployed on your host. The
       activation process associates your agent  with  your  account.  In  the
       activation process, you specify information such as the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region that you want to activate the agent in. You  activate  the
       agent in the Amazon Web Services Region where your target locations (in
       Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this  Amazon
       Web Services Region.

       You  can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide
       the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks  without  going
       over the public internet.

       You  can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multi-
       ple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the  task  to
       run.  If  you  use multiple agents for a source location, the status of
       all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run.

       Agents are automatically updated by Amazon Web Services  on  a  regular
       basis,  using  a  mechanism  that  ensures minimal interruption to your
       tasks.

SYNOPSIS
            create-agent
          --activation-key <value>
          [--agent-name <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--vpc-endpoint-id <value>]
          [--subnet-arns <value>]
          [--security-group-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --activation-key (string)
          Your agent activation key. You can get the activation key either  by
          sending  an  HTTP  GET request with redirects that enable you to get
          the agent IP address (port 80). Alternatively, you can get  it  from
          the DataSync console.

          The  redirect  URL returned in the response provides you the activa-
          tion key for your agent in the query string parameter  activationKey
          .  It  might  also include other activation-related parameters; how-
          ever, these are merely defaults. The arguments you pass to this  API
          call determine the actual configuration of your agent.

          For  more  information, see Activating an Agent in the DataSync User
          Guide.

       --agent-name (string)
          The name you configured for your agent. This value is a text  refer-
          ence that is used to identify the agent in the console.

       --tags (list)
          The  key-value  pair  that represents the tag that you want to asso-
          ciate with the agent. The value can be an empty string.  This  value
          helps you manage, filter, and search for your agents.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers representable in UTF-8 format, and  the  following  special
              characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single  entry  in  a  list of Amazon Web Services
              resource tags. TagListEntry returns an  array  that  contains  a
              list  of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --vpc-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC (virtual private cloud) endpoint  that  the  agent
          has  access  to. This is the client-side VPC endpoint, also called a
          PrivateLink. If you don't  have  a  PrivateLink  VPC  endpoint,  see
          Creating a VPC Endpoint Service Configuration in the Amazon VPC User
          Guide.

          VPC endpoint ID looks like this: vpce-01234d5aff67890e1 .

       --subnet-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets  in  which  DataSync
          will  create elastic network interfaces for each data transfer task.
          The agent that runs a task must be private. When you  start  a  task
          that  is  associated with an agent created in a VPC, or one that has
          access to an IP address in a VPC, then the task is also private.  In
          this case, DataSync creates four network interfaces for each task in
          your subnet. For a data transfer to work, the agent must be able  to
          route to all these four network interfaces.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-group-arns (list)
          The  ARNs  of the security groups used to protect your data transfer
          task subnets. See SecurityGroupArns .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AgentArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  agent.  Use  the  ListAgents
          operation to return a list of agents for your account and Amazon Web
          Services Region.
