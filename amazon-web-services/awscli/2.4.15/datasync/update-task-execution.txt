NAME
       update-task-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates execution of a task.

       You  can  modify bandwidth throttling for a task execution that is run-
       ning or queued. For more information, see  Adjusting  Bandwidth  Throt-
       tling for a Task Execution .

       NOTE:
          The  only  Option  that can be modified by UpdateTaskExecution is ``
          BytesPerSecond `` .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-task-execution
          --task-execution-arn <value>
          --options <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specific task  execution  that
          is being updated.

       --options (structure)
          Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of
          a StartTaskExecution operation. Behavior includes  preserving  meta-
          data  such  as  user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and file permissions,
          and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity  veri-
          fication, and so on.

          A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't
          specify an option in StartTaskExecution , the default value is used.
          You  can  override  the  defaults  options on each task execution by
          specifying an overriding Options value to StartTaskExecution .

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              A value that determines whether a  data  integrity  verification
              should  be  performed  at  the end of a task execution after all
              data and metadata have been transferred. For  more  information,
              see Configure task settings .

              Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

              ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED  (recommended): Perform verification only
              on files that were transferred.

              POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire des-
              tination  at  the  end of the transfer to verify that source and
              destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't  supported
              when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive stor-
              age classes.

              NONE: No additional verification is  done  at  the  end  of  the
              transfer,  but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with
              checksum verification during the transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              A value that determines whether files at the destination  should
              be  overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to NEVER
              a destination file will not be replaced by a source  file,  even
              if  the  destination  file  differs from the source file. If you
              modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you  can
              use this value to protect against overwriting those changes.

              Some  storage  classes  have  specific behaviors that can affect
              your  S3   storage   cost.   For   detailed   information,   see
              Considerations  when  working  with Amazon S3 storage classes in
              DataSync in the DataSync User Guide .

          Atime -> (string)
              A file metadata value that  shows  the  last  time  a  file  was
              accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you
              set Atime to BEST_EFFORT,  DataSync  attempts  to  preserve  the
              original  Atime attribute on all source files (that is, the ver-
              sion before the PREPARING phase). However, Atime 's behavior  is
              not  fully  standard  across  platforms, so DataSync can only do
              this on a best-effort basis.

              Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

              BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file Atime value  (rec-
              ommended).

              NONE: Ignore Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Atime  is  set  to BEST_EFFORT, Mtime must be set to PRE-
                 SERVE.

                 If Atime is set to NONE, Mtime must also be NONE.

          Mtime -> (string)
              A value that indicates the last time that a  file  was  modified
              (that  is,  a  file  was written to) before the PREPARING phase.
              This option is required for cases when you need to run the  same
              task more than one time.

              Default value: PRESERVE.

              PRESERVE: Preserve original Mtime (recommended)

              NONE: Ignore Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If   Mtime   is  set  to  PRESERVE,  Atime  must  be  set  to
                 BEST_EFFORT.

                 If Mtime is set to NONE, Atime must also be set to NONE.

          Uid -> (string)
              The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option  should
              only  be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more about
              what metadata is copied by  DataSync,  see  Metadata  Copied  by
              DataSync .

              Default  value:  INT_VALUE.  This preserves the integer value of
              the ID.

              INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID  (GID)
              (recommended).

              NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          Gid -> (string)
              The  POSIX  group  ID  (GID)  of  the file's owners. This option
              should only be set for NFS, EFS,  and  S3  locations.  For  more
              information  about  what  metadata  is  copied  by DataSync, see
              Metadata Copied by DataSync .

              Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the  integer  value  of
              the ID.

              INT_VALUE:  Preserve  the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID
              (recommended).

              NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              A value that specifies whether files  in  the  destination  that
              don't  exist in the source file system should be preserved. This
              option can affect  your  storage  cost.  If  your  task  deletes
              objects,  you  might  incur minimum storage duration charges for
              certain  storage  classes.   For   detailed   information,   see
              Considerations  when  working  with Amazon S3 storage classes in
              DataSync in the DataSync User Guide .

              Default value: PRESERVE.

              PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

              REMOVE: Delete destination  files  that  arent  present  in  the
              source.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              A  value  that  determines  whether DataSync should preserve the
              metadata of block and character devices in the source file  sys-
              tem,  and re-create the files with that device name and metadata
              on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of  such
              devices, only the name and metadata.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  can't  sync  the  actual  contents of such devices,
                 because they are nonterminal and don't return an  end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              Default value: NONE.

              NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

              PRESERVE:  Preserve  character  and  block device metadata. This
              option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              A value that determines which users or groups can access a  file
              for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of
              the file. This option should only be set for NFS,  EFS,  and  S3
              locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by
              DataSync, see Metadata Copied by DataSync .

              Default value: PRESERVE.

              PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

              NONE: Ignore permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can preserve extant permissions of  a  source  loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              A value that limits the bandwidth used by DataSync. For example,
              if you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              A  value  that  determines whether tasks should be queued before
              executing the tasks. If set to  ENABLED  ,  the  tasks  will  be
              queued. The default is ENABLED .

              If  you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable
              the tasks to run in series. For more information,  see  Queueing
              task executions .

          LogLevel -> (string)
              A value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes
              to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you pro-
              vide. For more information about providing a log group for Data-
              Sync, see CloudWatchLogGroupArn . If set to OFF ,  no  logs  are
              published.  BASIC  publishes logs on errors for individual files
              transferred, and TRANSFER  publishes  logs  for  every  file  or
              object that is transferred and integrity checked.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data
              and metadata that differ between the source and the  destination
              location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the
              source, without comparing to the destination location.

              CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that  is  new  or
              different  content  from  the source location to the destination
              location.

              ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destina-
              tion,  without comparing to existing content on the destination.

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              A value that determines which components  of  the  SMB  security
              descriptor are copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for
              Windows  File  Server  locations. For more information about how
              DataSync handles metadata, see How DataSync Handles Metadata and
              Special Files .

              Default value: OWNER_DACL.
                 OWNER_DACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the fol-
                 lowing metadata:

              o Object owner.

              o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which  deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object.

              When  choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS sys-
              tem access control lists (SACLs), which are used by  administra-
              tors to log attempts to access a secured object.
                 OWNER_DACL_SACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the
                 following metadata:

              o Object owner.

              o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which  deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object.

              o NTFS  system  access  control lists (SACLs), which are used by
                administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

              Copying SACLs requires granting additional  permissions  to  the
              Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For
              information about choosing a user that ensures  sufficient  per-
              missions to files, folders, and metadata, see user .
                 NONE  :  None  of  the SMB security descriptor components are
                 copied. Destination objects are owned by the  user  that  was
                 provided  for  accessing  the destination location. DACLs and
                 SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
