OPTIONS
       --server-hostname (string)
          The  name  of  the self-managed object storage server. This value is
          the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the object stor-
          age server. An agent uses this host name to mount the object storage
          server in a network.

       --server-port (integer)
          The port  that  your  self-managed  object  storage  server  accepts
          inbound network traffic on. The server port is set by default to TCP
          80 (HTTP) or TCP 443 (HTTPS). You can specify a custom port if  your
          self-managed object storage server requires one.

       --server-protocol (string)
          The  protocol  that  the  object storage server uses to communicate.
          Valid values are HTTP or HTTPS.

          Possible values:

          o HTTPS

          o HTTP

       --subdirectory (string)
          The subdirectory in the self-managed object storage server  that  is
          used to read data from.

       --bucket-name (string)
          The bucket on the self-managed object storage server that is used to
          read data from.

       --access-key (string)
          Optional. The access key is used  if  credentials  are  required  to
          access  the self-managed object storage server. If your object stor-
          age requires a user name and password to authenticate, use AccessKey
          and SecretKey to provide the user name and password, respectively.

       --secret-key (string)
          Optional.  The  secret  key  is  used if credentials are required to
          access the self-managed object storage server. If your object  stor-
          age requires a user name and password to authenticate, use AccessKey
          and SecretKey to provide the user name and password, respectively.

       --agent-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  agents  associated  with  the
          self-managed object storage server location.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The  key-value  pair that represents the tag that you want to add to
          the location. The value can be an empty string. We  recommend  using
          tags to name your resources.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single  entry  in  a  list of Amazon Web Services
              resource tags. TagListEntry returns an  array  that  contains  a
              list  of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  agents  associated  with  the
          self-managed object storage server location.
