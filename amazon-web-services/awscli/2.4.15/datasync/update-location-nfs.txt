NAME
       update-location-nfs -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  some  of  the  parameters of a previously created location for
       Network File System (NFS) access. For information about creating an NFS
       location, see Creating a location for NFS .

SYNOPSIS
            update-location-nfs
          --location-arn <value>
          [--subdirectory <value>]
          [--on-prem-config <value>]
          [--mount-options <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the NFS location to update.

       --subdirectory (string)
          The  subdirectory  in  the NFS file system that is used to read data
          from the NFS source location or write data to the  NFS  destination.
          The  NFS path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server, or
          a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can  be
          mounted by other NFS clients in your network.

          To  see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run "showmount -e
          nfs-server-name " from an NFS client that has access to your server.
          You  can  specify any directory that appears in the results, and any
          subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is acces-
          sible without Kerberos authentication.

          To  transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync
          must have permissions to read all the data. To ensure  this,  either
          configure  the  NFS  export with no_root_squash , or ensure that the
          files you want DataSync to access have permissions that  allow  read
          access  for all users. Doing either option enables the agent to read
          the files. For the agent to access directories, you  must  addition-
          ally enable all execute access.

          If  you  are  copying  data to or from your Snowcone device, see NFS
          Server on Snowcone for more information.

          For information  about  NFS  export  configuration,  see  18.7.  The
          /etc/exports Configuration File in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux doc-
          umentation.

       --on-prem-config (structure)
          A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for  a  Net-
          work File System (NFS) location.

          AgentArns -> (list)
              ARNs of the agents to use for an NFS location.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AgentArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AgentArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --mount-options (structure)
          Represents  the  mount  options  that  are available for DataSync to
          access an NFS location.

          Version -> (string)
              The specific NFS version that you want DataSync to use to  mount
              your  NFS share. If the server refuses to use the version speci-
              fied, the sync will fail. If you don't specify a version,  Data-
              Sync  defaults  to  AUTOMATIC  . That is, DataSync automatically
              selects a version based on negotiation with the NFS server.

              You can specify the following NFS versions:

              o
                **
                NFSv3 ** - stateless protocol version that  allows  for  asyn-
                chronous writes on the server.

              o
                **
                NFSv4.0 ** - stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version that
                supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

              o
                **
                NFSv4.1 ** - stateful protocol version that supports sessions,
                directory  delegations,  and parallel data processing. Version
                4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"NFS3"|"NFS4_0"|"NFS4_1"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
