OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          A subdirectory in the location's path. This subdirectory in the Ama-
          zon  FSx  for  Windows  File Server file system is used to read data
          from the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server source location or write
          data to the FSx for Windows File Server destination.

       --fsx-filesystem-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for the FSx for Windows File Server
          file system.

       --security-group-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the  security  groups  that  are
          used to configure the FSx for Windows File Server file system.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the
          resource. The value can be an empty string.  This  value  helps  you
          manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you
          create a name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              Represents a single entry in  a  list  of  Amazon  Web  Services
              resource  tags.  TagListEntry  returns  an array that contains a
              list of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is  called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --user (string)
          The  user who has the permissions to access files and folders in the
          FSx for Windows File Server file system.

          For information about choosing a user name that  ensures  sufficient
          permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see user .

       --domain (string)
          The  name of the Windows domain that the FSx for Windows File Server
          belongs to.

       --password (string)
          The password of the user who has the permissions to access files and
          folders in the FSx for Windows File Server file system.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the FSx for Windows File Server
          file system location that is created.
