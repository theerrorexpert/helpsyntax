DESCRIBE-LOCATION-NFS()                                DESCRIBE-LOCATION-NFS()



NAME
       describe-location-nfs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata, such as the path information, about an NFS location.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-location-nfs
          --location-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the NFS location to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  NFS  location  that  was
          described.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URL of the source NFS location that was described.

       OnPremConfig -> (structure)
          A  list  of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Net-
          work File System (NFS) location.

          AgentArns -> (list)
              ARNs of the agents to use for an NFS location.

              (string)

       MountOptions -> (structure)
          The NFS mount options that DataSync used to mount your NFS share.

          Version -> (string)
              The specific NFS version that you want DataSync to use to  mount
              your  NFS share. If the server refuses to use the version speci-
              fied, the sync will fail. If you don't specify a version,  Data-
              Sync  defaults  to  AUTOMATIC  . That is, DataSync automatically
              selects a version based on negotiation with the NFS server.

              You can specify the following NFS versions:

              o
                **
                NFSv3 ** - stateless protocol version that  allows  for  asyn-
                chronous writes on the server.

              o
                **
                NFSv4.0 ** - stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version that
                supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

              o
                **
                NFSv4.1 ** - stateful protocol version that supports sessions,
                directory  delegations,  and parallel data processing. Version
                4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the NFS location was created.
