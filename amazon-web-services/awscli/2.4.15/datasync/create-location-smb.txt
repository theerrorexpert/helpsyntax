            create-location-smb
          --subdirectory <value>
          --server-hostname <value>
          --user <value>
          [--domain <value>]
          --password <value>
          --agent-arns <value>
          [--mount-options <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          The subdirectory in the SMB file system that is used  to  read  data
          from  the  SMB source location or write data to the SMB destination.
          The SMB path should be a path that's exported by the SMB server,  or
          a  subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be
          mounted by other SMB clients in your network.

          NOTE:
              Subdirectory must be specified with forward slashes.  For  exam-
              ple, /path/to/folder .

          To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs
          to have permissions to mount the SMB share, as well as to access all
          the  data  in  that  share.  To  ensure this, either ensure that the
          user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share,
          and  who  has  the  appropriate permissions for all of the files and
          directories that you want DataSync to access, or use credentials  of
          a  member  of  the  Backup Operators group to mount the share. Doing
          either enables the agent to access the data. For the agent to access
          directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.

       --server-hostname (string)
          The  name  of the SMB server. This value is the IP address or Domain
          Name Service (DNS)  name  of  the  SMB  server.  An  agent  that  is
          installed  on-premises uses this hostname to mount the SMB server in
          a network.

          NOTE:
              This name must either be DNS-compliant or must be an IP  version
              4 (IPv4) address.

       --user (string)
          The  user  who  can  mount  the share, has the permissions to access
          files and folders in the SMB share.

          For information about choosing a user name that  ensures  sufficient
          permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see user .

       --domain (string)
          The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.

       --password (string)
          The  password  of  the user who can mount the share, has the permis-
          sions to access files and folders in the SMB share.

       --agent-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Simple  Mes-
          sage Block (SMB) location.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --mount-options (structure)
          The mount options used by DataSync to access the SMB server.

          Version -> (string)
              The  specific SMB version that you want DataSync to use to mount
              your SMB  share.  If  you  don't  specify  a  version,  DataSync
              defaults  to AUTOMATIC . That is, DataSync automatically selects
              a version based on negotiation with the SMB server.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"SMB2"|"SMB3"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair that represents the tag that you want to  add  to
          the  location.  The value can be an empty string. We recommend using
          tags to name your resources.

          (structure)
              Represents a single entry in  a  list  of  Amazon  Web  Services
              resource  tags.  TagListEntry  returns  an array that contains a
              list of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is  called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the source SMB file system loca-
          tion that is created.
