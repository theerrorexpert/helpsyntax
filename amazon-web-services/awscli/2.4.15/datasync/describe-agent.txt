DESCRIBE-AGENT()                                              DESCRIBE-AGENT()



NAME
       describe-agent -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata such as the name, the network interfaces, and the sta-
       tus (that is, whether the agent is running or not)  for  an  agent.  To
       specify  which agent to describe, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
       the agent in your request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-agent
          --agent-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --agent-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the agent to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AgentArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the agent.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the agent.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the agent. If the status is ONLINE, then the agent  is
          configured  properly  and is available to use. The Running status is
          the normal running status for an agent. If the  status  is  OFFLINE,
          the  agent's VM is turned off or the agent is in an unhealthy state.
          When the issue that caused the  unhealthy  state  is  resolved,  the
          agent returns to ONLINE status.

       LastConnectionTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the agent last connected to DataSync.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The  time  that  the  agent  was activated (that is, created in your
          account).

       EndpointType -> (string)
          The type of endpoint that your agent is connected to.  If  the  end-
          point is a VPC endpoint, the agent is not accessible over the public
          internet.

       PrivateLinkConfig -> (structure)
          The subnet and the security group that DataSync used to access a VPC
          endpoint.

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The  ID  of the VPC endpoint that is configured for an agent. An
              agent that is configured with a VPC endpoint will not be  acces-
              sible over the public internet.

          PrivateLinkEndpoint -> (string)
              The  private  endpoint  that is configured for an agent that has
              access to IP addresses in a PrivateLink . An agent that is  con-
              figured  with this endpoint will not be accessible over the pub-
              lic internet.

          SubnetArns -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets that are config-
              ured for an agent activated in a VPC or an agent that has access
              to a VPC endpoint.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the security groups that are
              configured for the EC2 resource that hosts an agent activated in
              a VPC or an agent that has access to a VPC endpoint.

              (string)
