LIST-TASKS()                                                      LIST-TASKS()



NAME
       list-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all the tasks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tasks  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Tasks

SYNOPSIS
            list-tasks
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          You can use API  filters  to  narrow  down  the  list  of  resources
          returned by ListTasks . For example, to retrieve all tasks on a spe-
          cific source location, you can use ListTasks with filter name  Loca-
          tionId and Operator Equals with the ARN for the location.

          (structure)
              You  can  use  API  filters to narrow down the list of resources
              returned by ListTasks . For example, to retrieve all tasks on  a
              source  location,  you  can use ListTasks with filter name Loca-
              tionId and Operator Equals with the ARN for the location.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter being used. Each API call  supports  a
                 list of filters that are available for it. For example, Loca-
                 tionId for ListTasks .

              Values -> (list)
                 The values that you want to  filter  for.  For  example,  you
                 might  want  to display only tasks for a specific destination
                 location.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator that is used to compare filter values (for exam-
                 ple, Equals or Contains ). For more about API filtering oper-
                 ators, see API filters for ListTasks and ListLocations .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "LocationId"|"CreationTime",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "Equals"|"NotEquals"|"In"|"LessThanOrEqual"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThanOrEqual"|"GreaterThan"|"Contains"|"NotContains"|"BeginsWith"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Tasks -> (list)
          A list of all the tasks that are returned.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single  entry  in  a list of tasks. TaskListEntry
              returns an  array  that  contains  a  list  of  tasks  when  the
              ListTasks  operation  is  called. A task includes the source and
              destination file systems to sync and the options to use for  the
              tasks.

              TaskArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the task.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the task.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An  opaque  string  that  indicates  the  position at which to begin
          returning the next list of tasks.
