DESCRIBE-TASK-EXECUTION()                            DESCRIBE-TASK-EXECUTION()



NAME
       describe-task-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed metadata about a task that is being executed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-task-execution
          --task-execution-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task that is being executed.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TaskExecutionArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  task execution that was
          described. TaskExecutionArn is hierarchical and includes TaskArn for
          the task that was executed.

          For  example,  a  TaskExecution  value  with  the  ARN arn:aws:data-
          sync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2/execu-
          tion/exec-08ef1e88ec491019b   executed   the   task   with  the  ARN
          arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2
          .

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the task execution.

          For  detailed  information about task execution statuses, see Under-
          standing Task Statuses in the DataSync User Guide.

       Options -> (structure)
          Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of
          a  StartTaskExecution  operation. Behavior includes preserving meta-
          data such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID),  and  file  permissions,
          and  also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity veri-
          fication, and so on.

          A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't
          specify an option in StartTaskExecution , the default value is used.
          You can override the defaults options  on  each  task  execution  by
          specifying an overriding Options value to StartTaskExecution .

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              A  value  that  determines whether a data integrity verification
              should be performed at the end of a  task  execution  after  all
              data  and  metadata have been transferred. For more information,
              see Configure task settings .

              Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

              ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification  only
              on files that were transferred.

              POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire des-
              tination at the end of the transfer to verify  that  source  and
              destination  are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported
              when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive stor-
              age classes.

              NONE:  No  additional  verification  is  done  at the end of the
              transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity-checked  with
              checksum verification during the transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              A  value that determines whether files at the destination should
              be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to  NEVER
              a  destination  file will not be replaced by a source file, even
              if the destination file differs from the  source  file.  If  you
              modify  files in the destination and you sync the files, you can
              use this value to protect against overwriting those changes.

              Some storage classes have specific  behaviors  that  can  affect
              your   S3   storage   cost.   For   detailed   information,  see
              Considerations when working with Amazon S3  storage  classes  in
              DataSync in the DataSync User Guide .

          Atime -> (string)
              A  file  metadata  value  that  shows  the  last time a file was
              accessed (that is, when the file was read or written to). If you
              set  Atime  to  BEST_EFFORT,  DataSync  attempts to preserve the
              original Atime attribute on all source files (that is, the  ver-
              sion  before the PREPARING phase). However, Atime 's behavior is
              not fully standard across platforms, so  DataSync  can  only  do
              this on a best-effort basis.

              Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

              BEST_EFFORT:  Attempt to preserve the per-file Atime value (rec-
              ommended).

              NONE: Ignore Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If Atime is set to BEST_EFFORT, Mtime must  be  set  to  PRE-
                 SERVE.

                 If Atime is set to NONE, Mtime must also be NONE.

          Mtime -> (string)
              A  value  that  indicates the last time that a file was modified
              (that is, a file was written to)  before  the  PREPARING  phase.
              This  option is required for cases when you need to run the same
              task more than one time.

              Default value: PRESERVE.

              PRESERVE: Preserve original Mtime (recommended)

              NONE: Ignore Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Mtime  is  set  to  PRESERVE,  Atime  must  be   set   to
                 BEST_EFFORT.

                 If Mtime is set to NONE, Atime must also be set to NONE.

          Uid -> (string)
              The  POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option should
              only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more  about
              what  metadata  is  copied  by  DataSync, see Metadata Copied by
              DataSync .

              Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the  integer  value  of
              the ID.

              INT_VALUE:  Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID)
              (recommended).

              NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          Gid -> (string)
              The POSIX group ID (GID)  of  the  file's  owners.  This  option
              should  only  be  set  for  NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more
              information about what  metadata  is  copied  by  DataSync,  see
              Metadata Copied by DataSync .

              Default  value:  INT_VALUE.  This preserves the integer value of
              the ID.

              INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID)  and  GID
              (recommended).

              NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              A  value  that  specifies  whether files in the destination that
              don't exist in the source file system should be preserved.  This
              option  can  affect  your  storage  cost.  If  your task deletes
              objects, you might incur minimum storage  duration  charges  for
              certain   storage   classes.   For   detailed  information,  see
              Considerations when working with Amazon S3  storage  classes  in
              DataSync in the DataSync User Guide .

              Default value: PRESERVE.

              PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

              REMOVE:  Delete  destination  files  that  arent  present in the
              source.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              A value that determines whether  DataSync  should  preserve  the
              metadata  of block and character devices in the source file sys-
              tem, and re-create the files with that device name and  metadata
              on  the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such
              devices, only the name and metadata.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can't sync the  actual  contents  of  such  devices,
                 because  they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              Default value: NONE.

              NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

              PRESERVE: Preserve character and  block  device  metadata.  This
              option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              A  value that determines which users or groups can access a file
              for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of
              the  file.  This  option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3
              locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by
              DataSync, see Metadata Copied by DataSync .

              Default value: PRESERVE.

              PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

              NONE: Ignore permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  can  preserve  extant permissions of a source loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              A value that limits the bandwidth used by DataSync. For example,
              if you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              A value that determines whether tasks should  be  queued  before
              executing  the  tasks.  If  set  to  ENABLED , the tasks will be
              queued. The default is ENABLED .

              If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can  enable
              the  tasks  to run in series. For more information, see Queueing
              task executions .

          LogLevel -> (string)
              A value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes
              to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you pro-
              vide. For more information about providing a log group for Data-
              Sync,  see  CloudWatchLogGroupArn  . If set to OFF , no logs are
              published. BASIC publishes logs on errors for  individual  files
              transferred,  and  TRANSFER  publishes  logs  for  every file or
              object that is transferred and integrity checked.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data
              and  metadata that differ between the source and the destination
              location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the
              source, without comparing to the destination location.

              CHANGED:  DataSync  copies  only data or metadata that is new or
              different content from the source location  to  the  destination
              location.

              ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destina-
              tion, without comparing to existing content on the  destination.

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              A  value  that  determines  which components of the SMB security
              descriptor are copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for
              Windows File Server locations. For more  information  about  how
              DataSync handles metadata, see How DataSync Handles Metadata and
              Special Files .

              Default value: OWNER_DACL.
                 OWNER_DACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the fol-
                 lowing metadata:

              o Object owner.

              o NTFS  discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object.

              When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS  sys-
              tem  access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administra-
              tors to log attempts to access a secured object.
                 OWNER_DACL_SACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the
                 following metadata:

              o Object owner.

              o NTFS  discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object.

              o NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which  are  used  by
                administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

              Copying  SACLs  requires  granting additional permissions to the
              Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For
              information  about  choosing a user that ensures sufficient per-
              missions to files, folders, and metadata, see user .
                 NONE : None of the SMB  security  descriptor  components  are
                 copied.  Destination  objects  are owned by the user that was
                 provided for accessing the destination  location.  DACLs  and
                 SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

       Excludes -> (list)
          A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a
          task.  The  list should contain a single filter string that consists
          of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|"  (that
          is, a pipe), for example: "/folder1|/folder2"

          (structure)
              Specifies  which  files,  folders,  and  objects  to  include or
              exclude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)
                 The type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports  the
                 SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  single  filter  string  that  consists  of the patterns to
                 include or exclude. The patterns are delimited by  "|"  (that
                 is, a pipe), for example: /folder1|/folder2

       Includes -> (list)
          A  list  of filter rules that determines which files to include when
          running a task. The list should contain a single filter string  that
          consists  of  the patterns to include. The patterns are delimited by
          "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: "/folder1|/folder2"

          (structure)
              Specifies which  files,  folders,  and  objects  to  include  or
              exclude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)
                 The  type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports the
                 SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              Value -> (string)
                 A single filter string  that  consists  of  the  patterns  to
                 include  or  exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that
                 is, a pipe), for example: /folder1|/folder2

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the task execution was started.

       EstimatedFilesToTransfer -> (long)
          The expected number of files that is to be transferred over the net-
          work.  This  value  is calculated during the PREPARING phase, before
          the TRANSFERRING phase. This value is the expected number  of  files
          to be transferred. It's calculated based on comparing the content of
          the source and destination locations  and  finding  the  delta  that
          needs to be transferred.

       EstimatedBytesToTransfer -> (long)
          The  estimated  physical  number  of bytes that is to be transferred
          over the network.

       FilesTransferred -> (long)
          The actual number of files that was transferred  over  the  network.
          This  value is calculated and updated on an ongoing basis during the
          TRANSFERRING phase. It's updated periodically when each file is read
          from the source and sent over the network.

          If  failures  occur  during  a transfer, this value can be less than
          EstimatedFilesToTransfer . This value can also be greater than Esti-
          matedFilesTransferred  in  some  cases.  This element is implementa-
          tion-specific for some location types, so don't use it as an indica-
          tor for a correct file number or to monitor your task execution.

       BytesWritten -> (long)
          The  number  of  logical bytes written to the destination Amazon Web
          Services storage resource.

       BytesTransferred -> (long)
          The physical number of bytes transferred over the network.

       Result -> (structure)
          The result of the task execution.

          PrepareDuration -> (long)
              The total time in milliseconds that DataSync spent in  the  PRE-
              PARING phase.

          PrepareStatus -> (string)
              The status of the PREPARING phase.

          TotalDuration -> (long)
              The  total  time  in milliseconds that DataSync took to transfer
              the file from the source to the destination location.

          TransferDuration -> (long)
              The total time in milliseconds that DataSync spent in the TRANS-
              FERRING phase.

          TransferStatus -> (string)
              The status of the TRANSFERRING phase.

          VerifyDuration -> (long)
              The  total time in milliseconds that DataSync spent in the VERI-
              FYING phase.

          VerifyStatus -> (string)
              The status of the VERIFYING phase.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              Errors that DataSync encountered during execution of  the  task.
              You can use this error code to help troubleshoot issues.

          ErrorDetail -> (string)
              Detailed description of an error that was encountered during the
              task execution. You can  use  this  information  to  help  trou-
              bleshoot issues.
