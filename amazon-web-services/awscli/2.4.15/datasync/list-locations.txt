LIST-LOCATIONS()                                              LIST-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       list-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of source and destination locations.

       If  you  have  more locations than are returned in a response (that is,
       the response returns  only  a  truncated  list  of  your  agents),  the
       response  contains a token that you can specify in your next request to
       fetch the next page of locations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-locations is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Locations

SYNOPSIS
            list-locations
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          You  can  use  API  filters  to  narrow  down  the list of resources
          returned by ListLocations . For example, to retrieve all tasks on  a
          specific source location, you can use ListLocations with filter name
          LocationType S3 and Operator Equals .

          (structure)
              You can use API filters to narrow down  the  list  of  resources
              returned  by  ListLocations  . For example, to retrieve all your
              Amazon S3 locations, you can use ListLocations with filter  name
              LocationType S3 and Operator Equals .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of the filter being used. Each API call supports a
                 list of filters that are available for it (for example, Loca-
                 tionType for ListLocations ).

              Values -> (list)
                 The  values  that  you  want  to filter for. For example, you
                 might want to display only Amazon S3 locations.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator that is used to compare filter values (for exam-
                 ple, Equals or Contains ). For more about API filtering oper-
                 ators, see API filters for ListTasks and ListLocations .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "LocationUri"|"LocationType"|"CreationTime",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "Equals"|"NotEquals"|"In"|"LessThanOrEqual"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThanOrEqual"|"GreaterThan"|"Contains"|"NotContains"|"BeginsWith"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Locations -> (list)
          An array that contains a list of locations.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of locations. LocationLis-
              tEntry returns an array that contains a list of  locations  when
              the ListLocations operation is called.

              LocationArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the location. For Network
                 File System (NFS) or Amazon EFS, the location is  the  export
                 path. For Amazon S3, the location is the prefix path that you
                 want to mount and use as the root of the location.

              LocationUri -> (string)
                 Represents a list of URIs of a location. LocationUri  returns
                 an   array  that  contains  a  list  of  locations  when  the
                 ListLocations operation is called.

                 Format: TYPE://GLOBAL_ID/SUBDIR .

                 TYPE designates the type of location. Valid values: NFS | EFS
                 | S3.

                 GLOBAL_ID  is  the globally unique identifier of the resource
                 that  backs   the   location.   An   example   for   EFS   is
                 us-east-2.fs-abcd1234  .  An  example  for  Amazon  S3 is the
                 bucket name, such as myBucket . An example for NFS is a valid
                 IPv4  address  or a host name compliant with Domain Name Ser-
                 vice (DNS).

                 SUBDIR is a valid file  system  path,  delimited  by  forward
                 slashes as is the
                 *
                 nix  convention. For NFS and Amazon EFS, it's the export path
                 to mount the location. For Amazon S3, it's  the  prefix  path
                 that you mount to and treat as the root of the location.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An  opaque  string  that  indicates  the  position at which to begin
          returning the next list of locations.
