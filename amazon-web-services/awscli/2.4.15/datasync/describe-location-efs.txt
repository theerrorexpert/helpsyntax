DESCRIBE-LOCATION-EFS()                                DESCRIBE-LOCATION-EFS()



NAME
       describe-location-efs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata,  such  as  the  path information about an Amazon EFS
       location.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-location-efs
          --location-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the EFS location to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  EFS  location  that  was
          described.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URL of the EFS location that was described.

       Ec2Config -> (structure)
          The  subnet and the security group that DataSync uses to access tar-
          get EFS file system. The subnet must have at least one mount  target
          for  that  file system. The security group that you provide needs to
          be able to communicate with the security group on the  mount  target
          in the subnet specified.

          SubnetArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the subnet and the security group that DataSync uses
              to access the target EFS file system.

          SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the security groups that are
              configured for the Amazon EC2 resource.

              (string)

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the EFS location was created.
