DESCRIPTION
       Updates  some  of  the  parameters of a previously created location for
       self-managed object storage server access. For information about creat-

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-location-object-storage
          --location-arn <value>
          [--server-port <value>]
          [--server-protocol <value>]
          [--subdirectory <value>]
          [--access-key <value>]
          [--secret-key <value>]
          [--agent-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  self-managed  object  storage
          server location to be updated.

       --server-port (integer)
          The  port  that  your  self-managed  object  storage  server accepts
          inbound network traffic on. The server port is set by default to TCP
          80  (HTTP) or TCP 443 (HTTPS). You can specify a custom port if your
          self-managed object storage server requires one.

       --server-protocol (string)
          The protocol that the object storage  server  uses  to  communicate.
          Valid values are HTTP or HTTPS .

          Possible values:

          o HTTPS

          o HTTP

       --subdirectory (string)
          The  subdirectory  in the self-managed object storage server that is
          used to read data from.

       --access-key (string)
          Optional. The access key is used  if  credentials  are  required  to
          access  the self-managed object storage server. If your object stor-
          age requires a user name and password to authenticate, use AccessKey
          and SecretKey to provide the user name and password, respectively.

       --secret-key (string)
          Optional.  The  secret  key  is  used if credentials are required to
          access the self-managed object storage server. If your object  stor-
          age requires a user name and password to authenticate, use AccessKey
          and SecretKey to provide the user name and password, respectively.

       --agent-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  agents  associated  with  the
          self-managed object storage server location.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
