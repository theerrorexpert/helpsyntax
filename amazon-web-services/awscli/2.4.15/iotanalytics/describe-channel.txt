DESCRIBE-CHANNEL()                                          DESCRIBE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       describe-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a channel.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-channel
          --channel-name <value>
          [--include-statistics | --no-include-statistics]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The name of the channel whose information is retrieved.

       --include-statistics | --no-include-statistics (boolean)
          If  true,  additional  statistical  information about the channel is
          included in the response. This feature can't be used with a  channel
          whose S3 storage is customer-managed.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve information about a channel

       The following describe-channel example displays details, including sta-
       tistics, for the specified channel.

          aws iotanalytics describe-channel \
              --channel-name mychannel \
              --include-statistics

       Output:

          {
              "statistics": {
                  "size": {
                      "estimatedSizeInBytes": 402.0,
                      "estimatedOn": 1561504380.0
                  }
              },
              "channel": {
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "name": "mychannel",
                  "lastUpdateTime": 1557860351.001,
                  "creationTime": 1557860351.001,
                  "retentionPeriod": {
                      "unlimited": true
                  },
                  "arn": "arn:aws:iotanalytics:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/mychannel"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       channel -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about the channel.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the channel.

          storage -> (structure)
              Where  channel data is stored. You can choose one of serviceMan-
              agedS3 or  customerManagedS3  storage.  If  not  specified,  the
              default  is  serviceManagedS3  .  You  can't change this storage
              option after the channel is created.

              serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
                 Used to store channel data in an S3  bucket  managed  by  IoT
                 Analytics.  You  can't  change the choice of S3 storage after
                 the data store is created.

              customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
                 Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket that  you  manage.
                 If  customer managed storage is selected, the retentionPeriod
                 parameter is ignored. You can't change the choice of S3 stor-
                 age after the data store is created.

                 bucket -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  S3  bucket  in  which channel data is
                     stored.

                 keyPrefix -> (string)
                     (Optional) The prefix used to  create  the  keys  of  the
                     channel  data  objects. Each object in an S3 bucket has a
                     key that is its unique identifier  in  the  bucket.  Each
                     object  in  a bucket has exactly one key. The prefix must
                     end with a forward slash (/).

                 roleArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics  permission
                     to interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

          arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the channel.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the channel.

          retentionPeriod -> (structure)
              How long, in days, message data is kept for the channel.

              unlimited -> (boolean)
                 If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

              numberOfDays -> (integer)
                 The  number  of days that message data is kept. The unlimited
                 parameter must be false.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              When the channel was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              When the channel was last updated.

          lastMessageArrivalTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time when a new message arrived in the channel.

              IoT Analytics updates this value at most once per minute for one
              channel.  Hence, the lastMessageArrivalTime value is an approxi-
              mation.

              This feature only applies to messages that arrived in  the  data
              store after October 23, 2020.

       statistics -> (structure)
          Statistics  about  the  channel.  Included  if the includeStatistics
          parameter is set to true in the request.

          size -> (structure)
              The estimated size of the channel.

              estimatedSizeInBytes -> (double)
                 The estimated size of the resource, in bytes.

              estimatedOn -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the estimate of the size of  the  resource  was
                 made.
