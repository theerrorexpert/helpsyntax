CREATE-CHANNEL()                                              CREATE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       create-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  to  create  a channel. A channel collects data from an MQTT topic
       and archives the raw, unprocessed messages before publishing  the  data
       to a pipeline.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-channel
          --channel-name <value>
          [--channel-storage <value>]
          [--retention-period <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The name of the channel.

       --channel-storage (structure)
          Where channel data is stored. You can choose one of serviceManagedS3
          or customerManagedS3 storage. If not specified, the default is  ser-
          viceManagedS3 . You can't change this storage option after the chan-
          nel is created.

          serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
              Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket managed by  IoT  Ana-
              lytics. You can't change the choice of S3 storage after the data
              store is created.

          customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
              Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket that you  manage.  If
              customer managed storage is selected, the retentionPeriod param-
              eter is ignored. You can't change the choice of S3 storage after
              the data store is created.

              bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket in which channel data is stored.

              keyPrefix -> (string)
                 (Optional)  The prefix used to create the keys of the channel
                 data objects. Each object in an S3 bucket has a key  that  is
                 its  unique identifier in the bucket. Each object in a bucket
                 has exactly one key. The prefix must end with a forward slash
                 (/).

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the role that grants IoT Analytics permission to
                 interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          serviceManagedS3={},customerManagedS3={bucket=string,keyPrefix=string,roleArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "serviceManagedS3": {

            },
            "customerManagedS3": {
              "bucket": "string",
              "keyPrefix": "string",
              "roleArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --retention-period (structure)
          How long, in days, message data is kept for the channel.  When  cus-
          tomerManagedS3 storage is selected, this parameter is ignored.

          unlimited -> (boolean)
              If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

          numberOfDays -> (integer)
              The  number  of  days  that  message data is kept. The unlimited
              parameter must be false.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          unlimited=boolean,numberOfDays=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "unlimited": true|false,
            "numberOfDays": integer
          }

       --tags (list)
          Metadata which can be used to manage the channel.

          (structure)
              A set of key-value pairs that are used to manage the resource.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a channel

       The following create-channel example creates a channel with the  speci-
       fied  configuration. A channel collects data from an MQTT topic and ar-
       chives the raw, unprocessed messages before publishing the  data  to  a
       pipeline.

          aws iotanalytics create-channel \
              --cli-input-json file://create-channel.json

       Contents of create-channel.json:

          {
              "channelName": "mychannel",
              "retentionPeriod": {
                  "unlimited": true
              },
              "tags": [
                  {
                      "key": "Environment",
                      "value": "Production"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "channelArn": "arn:aws:iotanalytics:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/mychannel",
              "channelName": "mychannel",
              "retentionPeriod": {
                  "unlimited": true
              }
          }

       channelArn -> (string)

       retentionPeriod -> (structure)
          How long, in days, message data is kept for the channel.

          unlimited -> (boolean)

          numberOfDays -> (integer)
