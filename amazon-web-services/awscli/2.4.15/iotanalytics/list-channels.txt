LIST-CHANNELS()                                                LIST-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of channels.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-channels  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: channelSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-channels
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of channels

       The  following  list-channels  example displays summary information for
       the available channels.

          aws iotanalytics list-channels

       Output:

          {
              "channelSummaries": [
                  {
                      "status": "ACTIVE",
                      "channelName": "mychannel",
                      "creationTime": 1557860351.001,
                      "lastUpdateTime": 1557860351.001
                  }
              ]
          }

       Reference.

OUTPUT
       channelSummaries -> (list)
          A list of ChannelSummary objects.

          (structure)
              A summary of information about a channel.

              channelName -> (string)
                 The name of the channel.

              channelStorage -> (structure)
                 Where channel data is stored.

                 serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
                     Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket managed by IoT
                     Analytics.

                 customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
                     Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket that you  man-
                     age.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  S3 bucket in which channel data is
                        stored.

                     keyPrefix -> (string)
                        (Optional) The prefix used to create the keys  of  the
                        channel  data objects. Each object in an S3 bucket has
                        a key that is its unique identifier within the  bucket
                        (each  object  in  a  bucket has exactly one key). The
                        prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

                     roleArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics  permis-
                        sion to interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the channel.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the channel was created.

              lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the channel was updated.

              lastMessageArrivalTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time when a new message arrived in the channel.

                 IoT  Analytics updates this value at most once per minute for
                 one channel. Hence, the lastMessageArrivalTime  value  is  an
                 approximation.

                 This  feature  only  applies  to messages that arrived in the
                 data store after October 23, 2020.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to retrieve the next set of results, or null if there  are
          no more results.
