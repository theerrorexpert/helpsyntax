DESCRIBE-DATASET()                                          DESCRIBE-DATASET()



NAME
       describe-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a dataset.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-dataset
          --dataset-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The name of the dataset whose information is retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The ARN of the dataset.

          actions -> (list)
              The  DatasetAction objects that automatically create the dataset
              contents.

              (structure)
                 A DatasetAction object that specifies  how  dataset  contents
                 are automatically created.

                 actionName -> (string)
                     The  name of the dataset action by which dataset contents
                     are automatically created.

                 queryAction -> (structure)
                     An SqlQueryDatasetAction object that uses an SQL query to
                     automatically create dataset contents.

                     sqlQuery -> (string)
                        A SQL query string.

                     filters -> (list)
                        Prefilters applied to message data.

                        (structure)
                            Information  that  is used to filter message data,
                            to segregate it  according  to  the  timeframe  in
                            which it arrives.

                            deltaTime -> (structure)
                               Used  to  limit  data to that which has arrived
                               since the last execution of the action.

                               offsetSeconds -> (integer)
                                   The  number   of   seconds   of   estimated
                                   in-flight  lag  time  of message data. When
                                   you create dataset contents  using  message
                                   data  from a specified timeframe, some mes-
                                   sage data might still  be  in  flight  when
                                   processing  begins, and so do not arrive in
                                   time to be processed.  Use  this  field  to
                                   make  allowances  for the in flight time of
                                   your message data, so that  data  not  pro-
                                   cessed   from   a   previous  timeframe  is
                                   included with the  next  timeframe.  Other-
                                   wise, missed message data would be excluded
                                   from processing during the  next  timeframe
                                   too, because its timestamp places it within
                                   the previous timeframe.

                               timeExpression -> (string)
                                   An expression by which the time of the mes-
                                   sage  data might be determined. This can be
                                   the name of a  timestamp  field  or  a  SQL
                                   expression  that is used to derive the time
                                   the message data was generated.

                 containerAction -> (structure)
                     Information that allows the system to run a containerized
                     application  to create the dataset contents. The applica-
                     tion must  be  in  a  Docker  container  along  with  any

                        tem to access required resources to run the container-
                        Action . This  includes,  at  minimum,  permission  to
                        retrieve  the  dataset  contents that are the input to
                        the containerized application.

                            containerAction (min: 1, max: 50).

                     variables -> (list)
                        The values of variables used in  the  context  of  the
                        execution of the containerized application (basically,
                        parameters passed to the application).  Each  variable
                        must  have  a name and a value given by one of string-

                            mission to deliver  dataset  contents  to  an  IoT
                            Events input.

                     s3DestinationConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Configuration information for delivery of dataset con-
                        tents to Amazon S3.

                        bucket -> (string)
                            The name of the S3 bucket to  which  dataset  con-
                            tents are delivered.

                        key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the dataset contents object in an S3
                            bucket. Each object has a key  that  is  a  unique
                            identifier. Each object has exactly one key.

                            You  can  create  a  unique key with the following
                            options:

                            o Use !{iotanalytics:scheduleTime} to  insert  the
                              time of a scheduled SQL query run.

                            o Use !{iotanalytics:versionId} to insert a unique
                              hash that identifies a dataset content.

                            o Use !{iotanalytics:creationTime} to  insert  the
                              creation time of a dataset content.

                            The  following  example creates a unique key for a
                            CSV file:  dataset/mydataset/!{iotanalytics:sched-
                            uleTime}/!{iotanalytics:versionId}.csv

                            NOTE:
                               If  you  don't use !{iotanalytics:versionId} to
                               specify the key, you might get duplicate  keys.
                               For  example,  you  might have two dataset con-
                               tents with the same scheduleTime but  different
                               versionId  s.  This means that one dataset con-
                               tent overwrites the other.

                               Glue Data Catalog  table  contains  partitioned
                               data  and descriptions of data sources and tar-
                               gets.

                               alog  in  which  the  table is located. An Glue
                               Data Catalog database contains metadata tables.

                        roleArn -> (string)
                            The ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics per-
                            mission to interact with your Amazon S3  and  Glue
                            resources.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the dataset.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              When the dataset was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time the dataset was updated.

          retentionPeriod -> (structure)
              Optional.  How  long,  in  days,  message  data  is kept for the
              dataset.

              unlimited -> (boolean)
                 If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

              numberOfDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days that message data is kept.  The  unlimited
                 parameter must be false.

          versioningConfiguration -> (structure)
              Optional. How many versions of dataset contents are kept. If not
              specified or set to null, only the latest version plus the  lat-
              est  succeeded  version (if they are different) are kept for the
              time period specified by the retentionPeriod parameter. For more
              information,  see  Keeping  Multiple  Versions  of IoT Analytics
              datasets in the IoT Analytics User Guide .

              unlimited -> (boolean)
                 If true, unlimited versions of dataset contents are kept.

              maxVersions -> (integer)
                 How many versions of dataset contents are kept. The unlimited
                 parameter must be false .

          lateDataRules -> (list)
              A list of data rules that send notifications to CloudWatch, when
              data arrives late. To specify lateDataRules , the  dataset  must
              use a DeltaTimer filter.

              (structure)
                 A structure that contains the name and configuration informa-
                 tion of a late data rule.

                 ruleName -> (string)
                     The name of the late data rule.

                 ruleConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The information needed to configure the late data rule.

                     deltaTimeSessionWindowConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The information needed to configure a delta time  ses-
                        sion window.

                        timeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
                            A  time  interval. You can use timeoutInMinutes so
                            that IoT Analytics can batch up late data  notifi-
                            cations  that  have  been generated since the last
                            execution. IoT Analytics sends one batch of  noti-
                            fications to Amazon CloudWatch Events at one time.
