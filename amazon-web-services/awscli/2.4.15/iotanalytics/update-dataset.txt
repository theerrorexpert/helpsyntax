OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The name of the dataset to update.

       --actions (list)
          A list of DatasetAction objects.

          (structure)
              A  DatasetAction  object that specifies how dataset contents are
              automatically created.

              actionName -> (string)
                 The name of the dataset action by which dataset contents  are
                 automatically created.

              queryAction -> (structure)
                 An  SqlQueryDatasetAction  object  that  uses an SQL query to
                 automatically create dataset contents.

                 sqlQuery -> (string)
                     A SQL query string.

                 filters -> (list)
                     Prefilters applied to message data.

                     (structure)
                        Information that is used to filter  message  data,  to
                        segregate  it  according  to the timeframe in which it
                        arrives.

                        deltaTime -> (structure)
                            Used to limit data to that which has arrived since
                            the last execution of the action.

                            offsetSeconds -> (integer)
                               The  number  of  seconds of estimated in-flight
                               lag time  of  message  data.  When  you  create
                               dataset  contents  using  message  data  from a
                               specified timeframe, some  message  data  might
                               still  be in flight when processing begins, and
                               so do not arrive in time to be  processed.  Use
                               this field to make allowances for the in flight
                               time of your message data,  so  that  data  not
                               processed from a previous timeframe is included
                               with the next timeframe. Otherwise, missed mes-
                               sage  data  would  be  excluded from processing
                               during the  next  timeframe  too,  because  its
                               timestamp  places  it within the previous time-
                               frame.

                            timeExpression -> (string)
                               An expression by which the time of the  message
                               data  might be determined. This can be the name
                               of a timestamp field or a SQL  expression  that
                               is used to derive the time the message data was
                               generated.

              containerAction -> (structure)
                 Information that allows the system  to  run  a  containerized
                 application  to  create the dataset contents. The application
                 must be in a Docker container along with any required support
                 libraries.

                 image -> (string)
                     The  ARN  of the Docker container stored in your account.
                     The Docker container contains an application and required
                     support  libraries  and  is used to generate dataset con-
                     tents.

                 executionRoleArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the role that gives permission to  the  system
                     to access required resources to run the containerAction .
                     This includes, at minimum,  permission  to  retrieve  the
                     dataset  contents that are the input to the containerized
                     application.

                 resourceConfiguration -> (structure)

                        containerAction . Possible values are: ACU_1  (vCPU=4,
                        memory=16 GiB) or ACU_2 (vCPU=8, memory=32 GiB).

                     volumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                        The  size,  in GB, of the persistent storage available
                        to the resource instance used to execute the  contain-
                        erAction (min: 1, max: 50).

                     The values of variables used in the context of the execu-
                     tion of the containerized application (basically, parame-
                     ters  passed to the application). Each variable must have
                     a name and a value given by one of stringValue , dataset-
                     ContentVersionValue , or outputFileUriValue .

          tions specified here.

          (structure)
              When  dataset contents are created, they are delivered to desti-

                        The ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics  permis-
                        sion  to  deliver  dataset  contents  to an IoT Events
                        input.

                 s3DestinationConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configuration information for delivery  of  dataset  con-
                     tents to Amazon S3.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the S3 bucket to which dataset contents
                        are delivered.

                     key -> (string)
                        The key of  the  dataset  contents  object  in  an  S3
                        bucket. Each object has a key that is a unique identi-
                        fier. Each object has exactly one key.

                        You  can  create  a  unique  key  with  the  following
                        options:

                        o Use  !{iotanalytics:scheduleTime} to insert the time
                          of a scheduled SQL query run.

                        o Use !{iotanalytics:versionId}  to  insert  a  unique
                          hash that identifies a dataset content.

                        o Use  !{iotanalytics:creationTime} to insert the cre-
                          ation time of a dataset content.

                        The following example creates a unique key for  a  CSV
                        file:       dataset/mydataset/!{iotanalytics:schedule-
                        Time}/!{iotanalytics:versionId}.csv

                        NOTE:
                            If  you  don't  use  !{iotanalytics:versionId}  to
                            specify the key, you might get duplicate keys. For
                            example, you might have two dataset contents  with
                            the  same  scheduleTime but different versionId s.
                            This means that one dataset content overwrites the
                            other.

                     glueConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Configuration  information for coordination with Glue,

                            The  name  of  the table in your Glue Data Catalog
                            that is used to perform  the  ETL  operations.  An
                            Glue  Data Catalog table contains partitioned data
                            and descriptions of data sources and targets.

                        databaseName -> (string)
                            The name of the database in your Glue Data Catalog
                            in  which the table is located. An Glue Data Cata-
                            log database contains metadata tables.

                     roleArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics  permis-
                        sion   to  interact  with  your  Amazon  S3  and  Glue
                        resources.

          specified or set to null, only the latest version  plus  the  latest
          succeeded  version  (if  they  are  different) are kept for the time
          period specified by the retentionPeriod parameter. For more informa-
          tion, see Keeping Multiple Versions of IoT Analytics datasets in the
          IoT Analytics User Guide .

          unlimited -> (boolean)
              If true, unlimited versions of dataset contents are kept.

          maxVersions -> (integer)
              How many versions of dataset contents are  kept.  The  unlimited
              parameter must be false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          unlimited=boolean,maxVersions=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "unlimited": true|false,
            "maxVersions": integer
          }

       --late-data-rules (list)
          A  list  of  data  rules that send notifications to CloudWatch, when
          data arrives late. To specify lateDataRules , the dataset must use a
          DeltaTimer filter.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains the name and configuration information
              of a late data rule.

              ruleName -> (string)
                 The name of the late data rule.

              ruleConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The information needed to configure the late data rule.

                 deltaTimeSessionWindowConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The information needed to configure a delta time  session
                     window.

                     timeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
                        A  time interval. You can use timeoutInMinutes so that
                        IoT Analytics can batch  up  late  data  notifications
                        that have been generated since the last execution. IoT
                        Analytics sends one batch of notifications  to  Amazon
                        CloudWatch Events at one time.

                        expression, see Date and Time Functions and  Operators
                        , in the Presto 0.172 Documentation .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ruleName=string,ruleConfiguration={deltaTimeSessionWindowConfiguration={timeoutInMinutes=integer}} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ruleName": "string",
              "ruleConfiguration": {
                "deltaTimeSessionWindowConfiguration": {
                  "timeoutInMinutes": integer
                }
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a dataset

       The following update-dataset example modifies the settings of the spec-
       ified dataset.

          aws iotanalytics update-dataset \
              --cli-input-json file://update-dataset.json

       Contents of update-dataset.json:

          {
              "datasetName": "mydataset",
              "actions": [
                  {
                      "actionName": "myDatasetUpdateAction",
                      "queryAction": {
                          "sqlQuery": "SELECT * FROM mydatastore"
                      }
                  }
              ],
              "retentionPeriod": {
                  "numberOfDays": 92
              }
          }

       This command produces no output.
