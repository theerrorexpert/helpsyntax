NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Used to update the settings of a channel.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-channel
          --channel-name <value>
          [--channel-storage <value>]
          [--retention-period <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The name of the channel to be updated.

       --channel-storage (structure)
          Where channel data is stored. You can choose one of serviceManagedS3
          or customerManagedS3 storage. If not specified, the default is  ser-
          viceManagedS3 . You can't change this storage option after the chan-
          nel is created.

          serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
              Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket managed by  IoT  Ana-
              lytics. You can't change the choice of S3 storage after the data
              store is created.

          customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
              Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket that you  manage.  If
              customer managed storage is selected, the retentionPeriod param-
              eter is ignored. You can't change the choice of S3 storage after
              the data store is created.

              bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket in which channel data is stored.

              keyPrefix -> (string)
                 (Optional)  The prefix used to create the keys of the channel
                 data objects. Each object in an S3 bucket has a key  that  is
                 its  unique identifier in the bucket. Each object in a bucket
                 has exactly one key. The prefix must end with a forward slash
                 (/).

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the role that grants IoT Analytics permission to
                 interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          serviceManagedS3={},customerManagedS3={bucket=string,keyPrefix=string,roleArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "serviceManagedS3": {

            },
            "customerManagedS3": {
              "bucket": "string",
              "keyPrefix": "string",
              "roleArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --retention-period (structure)
          How long, in days, message data is kept for the channel. The  reten-
          tion  period  can't be updated if the channel's Amazon S3 storage is
          customer-managed.

          unlimited -> (boolean)
              If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

          numberOfDays -> (integer)
              The number of days that message  data  is  kept.  The  unlimited
              parameter must be false.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          unlimited=boolean,numberOfDays=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "unlimited": true|false,
            "numberOfDays": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a channel

       The  following  update-channel  example  modifies  the settings for the
       specified channel.

          aws iotanalytics update-channel \
              --cli-input-json file://update-channel.json

       Contents of update-channel.json:

          {
              "channelName": "mychannel",
              "retentionPeriod": {
                  "numberOfDays": 92
              }
          }

       This command produces no output.

       Reference.
