LIST-DATASTORES()                                            LIST-DATASTORES()



NAME
       list-datastores -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of data stores.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-datastores  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: datastoreSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-datastores
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          A list of DatastoreSummary objects.

          (structure)
              A summary of information about a data store.

              datastoreName -> (string)
                 The name of the data store.

                     Analytics.

                 customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
                     Used to store data in an Amazon S3 bucket managed by  IoT
                     Analytics.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the Amazon S3 bucket where your data is

                        bucket has a key that is its unique identifier in  the
                        bucket.  Each  object in a bucket has exactly one key.
                        The prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

                     customerManagedS3Storage -> (structure)
                        Used to store data used by IoT SiteWise in  an  Amazon
                        S3 bucket that you manage.

                        bucket -> (string)
                            The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket where your data
                            is stored.

                        keyPrefix -> (string)
                            (Optional) The prefix used to create the  keys  of
                            the  data  store  data  objects. Each object in an
                            Amazon S3 bucket has a  key  that  is  its  unique
                            identifier  in the bucket. Each object in a bucket
                            has exactly one key. The prefix must  end  with  a
                            forward slash (/).

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the data store.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the data store was created.

              lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the data store was updated.

              lastMessageArrivalTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time when a new message arrived in the data store.

                 IoT  Analytics updates this value at most once per minute for
                 Amazon Simple Storage Service  one  data  store.  Hence,  the
                 lastMessageArrivalTime value is an approximation.

                 This  feature  only  applies  to messages that arrived in the
                 data store after October 23, 2020.

              fileFormatType -> (string)
                 The file format of the data in the data store.

              datastorePartitions -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the partition dimensions in a data
                 store.

                 partitions -> (list)

                               a timestamp.  The  default  format  is  seconds
                               since  epoch  (January  1, 1970 at midnight UTC
                               time).
