DESCRIBE-DATASTORE()                                      DESCRIBE-DATASTORE()



NAME
       describe-datastore -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a data store.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-datastore
          --datastore-name <value>
          [--include-statistics | --no-include-statistics]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --datastore-name (string)
          The name of the data store

       --include-statistics | --no-include-statistics (boolean)
          If  true, additional statistical information about the data store is
          included in the response. This feature can't be  used  with  a  data
          store whose S3 storage is customer-managed.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve information about a data store

       The  following  describe-datastore  example displays details, including
       statistics, for the specified data store.

          aws iotanalytics describe-datastore \
              --datastore-name mydatastore \
              --include-statistics

       Output:

          {
              "datastore": {
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "name": "mydatastore",
                  "lastUpdateTime": 1557858971.02,
                  "creationTime": 1557858971.02,
                  "retentionPeriod": {
                      "unlimited": true
                  },
                  "arn": "arn:aws:iotanalytics:us-west-2:123456789012:datastore/mydatastore"
              },
              "statistics": {
                  "size": {
                      "estimatedSizeInBytes": 397.0,
                      "estimatedOn": 1561592040.0
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       datastore -> (structure)
          Information about the data store.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the data store.

          storage -> (structure)
              Where  data in a data store is stored.. You can choose serviceM-
              anagedS3 storage, customerManagedS3 storage, or  iotSiteWiseMul-
              tiLayerStorage  storage.  The  default is serviceManagedS3 . You
              can't change the choice of Amazon S3  storage  after  your  data
              store is created.

              serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
                 Used to store data in an Amazon S3 bucket managed by IoT Ana-
                 lytics. You can't change the  choice  of  Amazon  S3  storage
                 after your data store is created.

              customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
                 S3-customer-managed;  When  you choose customer-managed stor-
                 age, the retentionPeriod  parameter  is  ignored.  You  can't
                 change  the choice of Amazon S3 storage after your data store
                 is created.

                 bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the Amazon  S3  bucket  where  your  data  is
                     stored.

                 keyPrefix -> (string)
                     (Optional) The prefix used to create the keys of the data
                     store data objects. Each object in an  Amazon  S3  bucket
                     has  a  key  that is its unique identifier in the bucket.
                     Each object in a bucket has exactly one key.  The  prefix
                     must end with a forward slash (/).

                 roleArn -> (string)
                     The  ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics permission
                     to interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

              iotSiteWiseMultiLayerStorage -> (structure)
                 Used to store data used by  IoT  SiteWise  in  an  Amazon  S3
                 bucket that you manage. You can't change the choice of Amazon
                 S3 storage after your data store is created.

                 customerManagedS3Storage -> (structure)
                     Used to store data used by IoT SiteWise in an  Amazon  S3
                     bucket that you manage.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the Amazon S3 bucket where your data is
                        stored.

                     keyPrefix -> (string)
                        (Optional) The prefix used to create the keys  of  the
                        data  store  data objects. Each object in an Amazon S3
                        bucket has a key that is its unique identifier in  the
                        bucket.  Each  object in a bucket has exactly one key.
                        The prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

          arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the data store.

          status -> (string)
              The status of a data store:
                 CREATING

              The data store is being created.
                 ACTIVE

              The data store has been created and can be used.
                 DELETING

              The data store is being deleted.

          retentionPeriod -> (structure)
              How long, in days, message data is kept for the data store. When
              customerManagedS3   storage   is  selected,  this  parameter  is
              ignored.

              unlimited -> (boolean)
                 If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

              numberOfDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days that message data is kept.  The  unlimited
                 parameter must be false.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              When the data store was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time the data store was updated.

          lastMessageArrivalTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time when a new message arrived in the data store.

              IoT  Analytics  updates  this  value at most once per minute for
              Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  one  data  store.  Hence,  the
              lastMessageArrivalTime value is an approximation.

              This  feature  only applies to messages that arrived in the data
              store after October 23, 2020.

          fileFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
              Contains the configuration information of file formats. IoT Ana-
              lytics data stores support JSON and Parquet .

              The  default  file format is JSON. You can specify only one for-
              mat.

              You can't change the file  format  after  you  create  the  data
              store.

              jsonConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Contains the configuration information of the JSON format.

                        (structure)
                            Contains  information  about  a column that stores
                            your data.

                            name -> (string)
                               The name of the column.

                 (structure)
                     A  single dimension to partition a data store. The dimen-
                     sion must be an AttributePartition or  a  TimestampParti-
                     tion .

                            timestamp.  The  default  format  is seconds since
                            epoch (January 1, 1970 at midnight UTC time).

       statistics -> (structure)
