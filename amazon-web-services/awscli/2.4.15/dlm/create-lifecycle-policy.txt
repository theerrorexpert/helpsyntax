          The configuration details of the lifecycle policy.

          PolicyType -> (string)
              The valid target resource types and actions a policy can manage.
              Specify EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT to  create  a  lifecycle  policy
              that  manages  the  lifecycle  of  Amazon EBS snapshots. Specify
              IMAGE_MANAGEMENT to create a lifecycle policy that  manages  the
              lifecycle of EBS-backed AMIs. Specify EVENT_BASED_POLICY to cre-
              ate an event-based policy that performs specific actions when  a
              defined event occurs in your Amazon Web Services account.

              The default is EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT .

          ResourceTypes -> (list)
              The  target  resource  type for snapshot and AMI lifecycle poli-
              cies. Use VOLUME to create snapshots of  individual  volumes  or
              use  INSTANCE  to create multi-volume snapshots from the volumes
              for an instance.

              This parameter is required for snapshot and AMI  policies  only.
              If  you are creating an event-based policy, omit this parameter.

              (string)

          ResourceLocations -> (list)

                        source  resource,  specify CLOUD . To create snapshots
                        on the same Outpost as the  source  resource,  specify
                        OUTPOST_LOCAL  .  If you omit this parameter, CLOUD is
                        used by default.

                        If the policy targets resources in an Amazon Web  Ser-
                        vices  Region,  then  you must create snapshots in the
                        same Region as the source resource.

                        If the policy targets resources on  an  Outpost,  then
                        you  can  create  snapshots on the same Outpost as the
                        source resource, or in the Region of that Outpost.

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The interval between snapshots. The  supported  values

                        The amount of time to retain each snapshot. The  maxi-
                        mum  is  100 years. This is equivalent to 1200 months,
                        5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                     IntervalUnit -> (string)

                        The  Availability  Zones in which to enable fast snap-
                        shot restore.

                        (string)

                 CrossRegionCopyRules -> (list)
                     The rule for cross-Region snapshot copies.

                     You can only specify cross-Region copy rules for policies
                     that  create snapshots in a Region. If the policy creates
                     snapshots on an Outpost, then you cannot copy  the  snap-
                     shots to a Region or to an Outpost. If the policy creates
                     snapshots in a Region, then snapshots can be copied to up
                     to three Regions or Outposts.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a rule for cross-Region snapshot copies.

                        TargetRegion -> (string)
                            Avoid using this parameter when creating new poli-
                            cies. Instead, use  Target  to  specify  a  target
                            Region or a target Outpost for snapshot copies.

                            For  policies  created before the Target parameter
                            was introduced, this parameter indicates the  tar-
                            get Region for snapshot copies.

                        Target -> (string)
                            The  target  Region  or  the  Amazon Resource Name
                            (ARN) of  the  target  Outpost  for  the  snapshot
                            copies.

                            Use  this  parameter  instead of TargetRegion . Do
                            not specify both.

                        Encrypted -> (boolean)
                            To encrypt a copy of an  unencrypted  snapshot  if
                            encryption  by  default  is  not  enabled,  enable
                            encryption  using  this   parameter.   Copies   of
                            encrypted  snapshots  are  encrypted, even if this
                            parameter is false or if encryption by default  is
                            not enabled.

                        CmkArn -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to
                            use for EBS encryption. If this parameter  is  not
                            specified,  the default KMS key for the account is
                            used.

                        CopyTags -> (boolean)

                               retention period, and it can't be greater  than
                               10 years. This is equivalent to 120 months, 520
                               weeks, or 3650 days.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)

                     The AMI deprecation rule for the schedule.

                     Count -> (integer)
                        If the schedule has a count-based retention rule, this
                        parameter specifies the number of oldest AMIs to  dep-

                 whether to exclude the root  volume  from  snapshots  created
                 using CreateSnapshots . The default is false.

              NoReboot -> (boolean)
                 Applies  to  AMI  lifecycle  policies only. Indicates whether
                 targeted instances are rebooted  when  the  lifecycle  policy
                 runs. true indicates that targeted instances are not rebooted
                 when the policy runs. false indicates that  target  instances
                 are  rebooted  when  the  policy  runs.  The  default is true
                 (instances are not rebooted).

          EventSource -> (structure)
              The event that triggers the event-based policy.

              This parameter is required for event-based policies only. If you
              are creating a snapshot or AMI policy, omit this parameter.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  source  of  the event. Currently only managed CloudWatch
                 Events rules are supported.

              Parameters -> (structure)
                 Information about the event.

                 EventType -> (string)
                     The type  of  event.  Currently,  only  snapshot  sharing
                     events are supported.

                 SnapshotOwner -> (list)
                     The  IDs  of  the  Amazon  Web Services accounts that can
                     trigger policy by sharing snapshots  with  your  account.
                     The  policy  only runs if one of the specified Amazon Web
                     Services accounts shares a snapshot with your account.

                     (string)

                 DescriptionRegex -> (string)
                     The snapshot description that can trigger the policy. The
                     description  pattern is specified using a regular expres-
                     sion. The policy runs only if a snapshot with a  descrip-
                     tion  that  matches  the specified pattern is shared with
                     your account.

                     For  example,  specifying  ^.*Created  for  policy:  pol-
                     icy-1234567890abcdef0.*$  configures  the  policy  to run
                     only   if    snapshots    created    by    policy    pol-
                     icy-1234567890abcdef0 are shared with your account.

          Actions -> (list)
              The actions to be performed when the event-based policy is trig-
              gered. You can specify only one action per policy.

              This parameter is required for event-based policies only. If you
              are creating a snapshot or AMI policy, omit this parameter.

              (structure)
                 Specifies an action for an event-based policy.

                 Name -> (string)
                     A descriptive name for the action.

                 CrossRegionCopy -> (list)
                     The rule for copying shared snapshots across Regions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  a  rule for copying shared snapshots across
                        Regions.

                        Target -> (string)
                            The target Region.

                        EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The encryption settings for the copied snapshot.

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               To encrypt a copy of  an  unencrypted  snapshot
                               when  encryption  by  default  is  not enabled,
                               enable encryption using this parameter.  Copies
                               of  encrypted  snapshots are encrypted, even if
                               this parameter is false or when  encryption  by
                               default is not enabled.

                            CmkArn -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key
                               to use for EBS encryption. If this parameter is
                               not  specified,  the  default  KMS  key for the
                               account is used.

                        RetainRule -> (structure)
                            Specifies  the  retention  rule  for  cross-Region
                            snapshot copies.

                            Interval -> (integer)
                               The amount of time to retain each snapshot. The
                               maximum is 100 years.  This  is  equivalent  to
                               1200 months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)
                               The unit of time for time-based retention.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a lifecycle policy

       The  following create-lifecycle-policy example creates a lifecycle pol-
       icy that creates a daily snapshot of volumes at the specified time. The
       specified  tags  are  added  to the snapshots, and tags are also copied
       from the volume and added to the snapshots. If creating a new  snapshot
       exceeds the specified maximum count, the oldest snapshot is deleted.
