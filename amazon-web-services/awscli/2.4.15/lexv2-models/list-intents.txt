OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot that contains the intent.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the intent.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the language and locale of the intents to list.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines  the  sort  order  for  the response from the ListIntents
          operation. You can choose to sort by the intent name or last updated
          date in either ascending or descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of intents.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list. You can choose ascending or descend-
              ing.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "IntentName"|"LastUpdatedDateTime",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --filters (list)
          Provides the specification of a filter used to limit the intents  in
          the  response to only those that match the filter specification. You
          can only specify one filter and only one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters the response from the ListIntents operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to use for the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 The value to use for the filter.

                 (string)

              operator -> (string)
                 The operator to use for  the  filter.  Specify  EQ  when  the
                 ListIntents  operation  should return only aliases that equal
                 the specified value. Specify CO when the  ListIntents  opera-
                 tion  should return aliases that contain the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "IntentName",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of intents to return in each page of results.  If
          there are fewer results than the max page size, only the actual num-
          ber of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListIntents operation contains more results
          than  specified  in the maxResults parameter, a token is returned in
          the response.

          Use the returned token in the nextToken parameter of  a  ListIntents
          request  to  return  the next page of results. For a complete set of
          results, call the ListIntents operation until the nextToken returned
          in the response is null.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

          Summary  information  for  the intents that meet the filter criteria
          specified in the request. The length of the list is specified in the
          maxResults  parameter  of  the  request.  If  there are more intents
          available, the nextToken field contains a token to get the next page
          of results.

              operation.

              intentId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier assigned to the intent. Use this ID  to
                 get   detailed   information   about   the  intent  with  the
                 DescribeIntent operation.

                     The name of a context that must be active for  an  intent
                     to be selected by Amazon Lex.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the context.

              outputContexts -> (list)
                 The  output  contexts  that are activated when this intent is
                 fulfilled.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a session context that  is  activated  when  an
                     intent is fulfilled.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the output context.

                     timeToLiveInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The  amount  of time, in seconds, that the output con-
                        text should remain active. The time  is  figured  from
                        the first time the context is sent to the user.

                     turnsToLive -> (integer)
                        The  number of conversation turns that the output con-
                        text should remain active.  The  number  of  turns  is
                        counted  from  the first time that the context is sent
                        to the user.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the date and time that the intent  was  last
                 updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListIntents operation. If  the  nextToken  field  is
          present,  you  send  the  contents  as  the nextToken parameter of a
          ListIntents operation request to get the next page of results.
