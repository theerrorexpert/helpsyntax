UPDATE-EXPORT()                                                UPDATE-EXPORT()



NAME
       update-export -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the password used to protect an export zip archive.

       The  password  is  not required. If you don't supply a password, Amazon
       Lex generates a zip file that is not protected by a password.  This  is
       the  archive that is available at the pre-signed S3 URL provided by the
       DescribeExport operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-export
          --export-id <value>
          [--file-password <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-id (string)
          The unique identifier Amazon Lex assigned to the export.

       --file-password (string)
          The new password to use to encrypt the export zip archive.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
