SYNOPSIS
            list-recommended-intents
          --bot-id <value>
          --bot-version <value>
          --locale-id <value>
          --bot-recommendation-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot  associated  with  the  recommended
          intents.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the recommended intents.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  language  and  locale  of  the recommended
          intents.

       --bot-recommendation-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot recommendation that  contains  the  recom-
          mended intents.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  response from the ListRecommendedIntents operation contains
          more results than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token  is
          returned  in the response. Use that token in the nextToken parameter
          to return the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of bot recommendations to return in each page  of
          results. If there are fewer results than the max page size, only the
          actual number of results are returned.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot  associated  with  the  recommended
          intent.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the intent.

       localeId -> (string)
          The  identifier  of  the language and locale of the intents to list.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       botRecommendationId -> (string)
          The  identifier  of  the bot recommendation that contains the recom-
          mended intent.

       summaryList -> (list)
          Summary information for the intents that meet  the  filter  criteria
          specified in the request. The length of the list is specified in the
          maxResults parameter of the  request.  If  there  are  more  intents
          available, the nextToken field contains a token to get the next page
          of results.

          (structure)
              An object that contains a summary of a recommended intent.

              intentId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of a recommended intent associated with
                 the bot recommendation.

              intentName -> (string)
                 The name of a recommended intent associated with the bot rec-
                 ommendation.

              sampleUtterancesCount -> (integer)
                 The count of sample utterances of a recommended  intent  that
                 is associated with a bot recommendation.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListRecommendedIntents operation. If  the  nextToken
          field  is  present, you send the contents as the nextToken parameter
          of a ListRecommendedIntents operation request to get the  next  page
          of results.
