              By  specifying true in the childDirected field, you confirm that
              your use of Amazon Lex is related  to  a  website,  program,  or
              other  application  that is directed or targeted, in whole or in
              part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. By specify-
              ing  false in the childDirected field, you confirm that your use
              of Amazon Lex is not related to a  website,  program,  or  other
              application  that  is directed or targeted, in whole or in part,
              to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. You may not spec-

              part,  to  children  under  age 13, you must obtain any required
              verifiable parental consent under COPPA. For information regard-
              ing the use of Amazon Lex in connection with websites, programs,
              or other applications that are directed or targeted, in whole or
              in part, to children under age 13, see the Amazon Lex FAQ .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          childDirected=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "childDirected": true|false
          }

       --idle-session-ttl-in-seconds (integer)
          The  time, in seconds, that Amazon Lex should keep information about
          a user's conversation with the bot.

          A user interaction remains active for the amount of time  specified.
          If  no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and
          Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout.

          You can specify between 60 (1 minute) and 86,400 (24 hours) seconds.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
