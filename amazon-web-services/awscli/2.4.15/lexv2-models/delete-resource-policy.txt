DELETE-RESOURCE-POLICY()                              DELETE-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  an  existing  policy  from a bot or bot alias. If the resource
       doesn't have a policy attached, Amazon Lex returns an exception.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-resource-policy
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--expected-revision-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bot or bot alias that has  the
          resource policy attached.

       --expected-revision-id (string)
          The identifier of the revision to edit. If this ID doesn't match the
          current revision number, Amazon Lex returns an exception

          If you don't specify a revision ID, Amazon Lex will delete the  cur-
          rent policy.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       resourceArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the bot or bot alias that the
          resource policy was deleted from.

       revisionId -> (string)
          The current revision of the resource policy. Use the revision ID  to
          make  sure  that  you  are  updating  the  most current version of a
          resource policy when you add  a  policy  statement  to  a  resource,
          delete a resource, or update a resource.
