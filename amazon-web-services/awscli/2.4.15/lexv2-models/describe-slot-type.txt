NAME
       describe-slot-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets metadata information about a slot type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-slot-type
          --slot-type-id <value>
          --bot-id <value>
          --bot-version <value>
          --locale-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --slot-type-id (string)
          The identifier of the slot type.

       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the slot type.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the slot type.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  language  and  locale  of the slot type to
          describe. The string must match one of the  supported  locales.  For
          more information, see Supported languages .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       slotTypeId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the slot type.

       slotTypeName -> (string)
          The name specified for the slot type.

       description -> (string)
          The description specified for the slot type.

       slotTypeValues -> (list)
          The  values  that  the slot type can take. Includes any synonyms for
          the slot type values.

          (structure)
              Each slot type can have a set of values. Each SlotTypeValue rep-
              resents a value that the slot type can take.

              sampleValue -> (structure)
                 The value of the slot type entry.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value that can be used for a slot type.

              synonyms -> (list)
                 Additional values related to the slot type entry.

                 (structure)
                     Defines one of the values for a slot type.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value that can be used for a slot type.

       valueSelectionSetting -> (structure)
          The  strategy  that Amazon Lex uses to choose a value from a list of
          possible values.

          resolutionStrategy -> (string)
              Determines the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex uses  to
              return slot type values. The field can be set to one of the fol-
              lowing values:

              o OriginalValue - Returns the value entered by the user, if  the
                user value is similar to the slot value.

              o TopResolution  -  If  there is a resolution list for the slot,
                return the first value in the resolution list as the slot type
                value. If there is no resolution list, null is returned.

              If  you don't specify the valueSelectionStrategy, the default is
              OriginalValue.

          regexFilter -> (structure)
              A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

              pattern -> (string)
                 A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

                 Use a standard regular expression. Amazon  Lex  supports  the
                 following characters in the regular expression:

                 o A-Z, a-z

                 o 0-9

                 o Unicode characters ("u<Unicode>")

                 Represent  Unicode  characters  with four digits, for example
                 "u0041" or "u005A".

                 The following regular expression operators are not supported:

                 o Infinite repeaters:
                   *
                   , +, or {x,} with no upper bound.

                 o Wild card (.)

          advancedRecognitionSetting -> (structure)
              Provides  settings that enable advanced recognition settings for
              slot values.

              audioRecognitionStrategy -> (string)
                 Enables using the slot values as a custom vocabulary for rec-
                 ognizing user utterances.

       parentSlotTypeSignature -> (string)
          The built in slot type used as a parent to this slot type.

       botId -> (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the slot type.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the slot type.

       localeId -> (string)
          The language and locale specified for the slot type.

       creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp of the date and time that the slot type was created.

       lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
          A  timestamp  of  the  date  and  time  that  the slot type was last
          updated.

       externalSourceSetting -> (structure)
          Provides information about the external source of  the  slot  type's
          definition.

          grammarSlotTypeSetting -> (structure)
              Settings  required  for  a slot type based on a grammar that you
              provide.

              source -> (structure)
                 The source of the grammar used to create the slot type.

                 s3BucketName -> (string)
