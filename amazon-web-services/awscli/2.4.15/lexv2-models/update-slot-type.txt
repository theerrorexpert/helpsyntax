OPTIONS
       --slot-type-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the slot type to update.

       --slot-type-name (string)
          The new name of the slot type.

              resents a value that the slot type can take.

              sampleValue -> (structure)
                 The value of the slot type entry.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value that can be used for a slot type.

              synonyms -> (list)
                 Additional values related to the slot type entry.

                 (structure)
                     Defines one of the values for a slot type.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value that can be used for a slot type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sampleValue={value=string},synonyms=[{value=string},{value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "sampleValue": {
                "value": "string"
              },
              "synonyms": [
                {
                  "value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --value-selection-setting (structure)
          The  strategy  that  Amazon  Lex should use when deciding on a value
          from the list of slot type values.

          resolutionStrategy -> (string)
              Determines the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex uses  to
              return slot type values. The field can be set to one of the fol-
              lowing values:

              o OriginalValue - Returns the value entered by the user, if  the
                user value is similar to the slot value.

              o TopResolution  -  If  there is a resolution list for the slot,
                return the first value in the resolution list as the slot type
                value. If there is no resolution list, null is returned.

              If  you don't specify the valueSelectionStrategy, the default is
              OriginalValue.

          regexFilter -> (structure)
              A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

              pattern -> (string)
                 A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

                 Use a standard regular expression. Amazon  Lex  supports  the
                 following characters in the regular expression:

                 o A-Z, a-z

                 o 0-9

                 o Unicode characters ("u<Unicode>")

                 Represent  Unicode  characters  with four digits, for example
                 "u0041" or "u005A".

                 The following regular expression operators are not supported:

                 o Infinite repeaters:
                   *
                   , +, or {x,} with no upper bound.

                 o Wild card (.)

          advancedRecognitionSetting -> (structure)
              Provides  settings that enable advanced recognition settings for
              slot values.

              audioRecognitionStrategy -> (string)
                 Enables using the slot values as a custom vocabulary for rec-
                 ognizing user utterances.

          definition.

          grammarSlotTypeSetting -> (structure)

                 s3BucketName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  S3  bucket  that contains the grammar
                     source.

                 s3ObjectKey -> (string)
                     The path to the grammar in the S3 bucket.

                 kmsKeyArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon KMS key required to decrypt  the  contents  of
                     the grammar, if any.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          grammarSlotTypeSetting={source={s3BucketName=string,s3ObjectKey=string,kmsKeyArn=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "grammarSlotTypeSetting": {

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
