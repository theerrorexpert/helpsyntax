          from the CreateUploadUrl operation.

       --resource-specification (structure)
          Parameters for creating the bot, bot locale or custom vocabulary.

          botImportSpecification -> (structure)
              Parameters for importing a bot.

              botName -> (string)
                 The name that Amazon Lex should use for the bot.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used to build
                 and run the bot.

              dataPrivacy -> (structure)
                 By default, data stored by Amazon Lex is encrypted. The  Dat-
                 aPrivacy  structure provides settings that determine how Ama-
                 zon Lex handles special cases of securing the data  for  your
                 bot.

                 childDirected -> (boolean)
                     For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model
                     Building Service, you must specify whether  your  use  of
                     Amazon  Lex  is  related  to a website, program, or other
                     application that is directed or targeted, in whole or  in
                     part,  to  children under age 13 and subject to the Chil-
                     dren's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by  specify-
                     ing true or false in the childDirected field. By specify-
                     ing true in the childDirected  field,  you  confirm  that
                     your  use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program,
                     or other application that is  directed  or  targeted,  in
                     whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to
                     COPPA. By specifying false in  the  childDirected  field,
                     you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is not related to
                     a website, program, or other application that is directed
                     or  targeted,  in whole or in part, to children under age
                     13 and subject to COPPA. You may not  specify  a  default
                     value  for  the  childDirected  field that does not accu-
                     rately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is  related
                     to  a  website,  program,  or  other  application that is
                     directed or targeted, in whole or in  part,  to  children
                     under  age 13 and subject to COPPA. If your use of Amazon
                     Lex relates to a website, program, or  other  application
                     that  is  directed in whole or in part, to children under
                     age 13, you must obtain any required verifiable  parental
                     consent under COPPA. For information regarding the use of
                     Amazon Lex in  connection  with  websites,  programs,  or
                     other  applications  that  are  directed  or targeted, in
                     whole or in part, to  children  under  age  13,  see  the
                     Amazon Lex FAQ .

              idleSessionTTLInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The time, in seconds, that Amazon Lex should keep information
                 about a user's conversation with the bot.

                 A user interaction remains active  for  the  amount  of  time
                 specified.  If  no  conversation occurs during this time, the
                 session expires and Amazon  Lex  deletes  any  data  provided
                 before the timeout.

                 You  can  specify between 60 (1 minute) and 86,400 (24 hours)
                 seconds.

              botTags -> (map)
                 A list of tags to add to the bot. You can only add tags  when
                 you  import  a  bot. You can't use the UpdateBot operation to
                 update tags. To update tags, use the TagResource operation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              testBotAliasTags -> (map)
                 A list of tags to add to the test alias for a  bot.  You  can
                 only  add  tags  when  you  import  a  bot. You can't use the
                 UpdateAlias operation to update tags. To update tags  on  the
                 test alias, use the TagResource operation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

          botLocaleImportSpecification -> (structure)
              Parameters for importing a bot locale.

              botId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the bot to import the locale to.

              botVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the bot to import the locale to. This can only
                 be the DRAFT version of the bot.

              localeId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the language and locale that the  bot  will
                 be  used  in.  The  string  must  match  one of the supported
                 locales. All of the intents, slot types, and  slots  used  in
                 the  bot must have the same locale. For more information, see
                 Supported languages .

              nluIntentConfidenceThreshold -> (double)
                 Determines the threshold where Amazon  Lex  will  insert  the
                 AMAZON.FallbackIntent  ,  AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent , or both
                 when returning alternative intents. AMAZON.FallbackIntent and
                 AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent  are only inserted if they are con-
                 figured for the bot.

                 For example, suppose a bot is configured with the  confidence
                 threshold  of 0.80 and the AMAZON.FallbackIntent . Amazon Lex
                 returns three alternative intents with the  following  confi-
                 dence scores: IntentA (0.70), IntentB (0.60), IntentC (0.50).
                 The response from the PostText operation would be:

                 o AMAZON.FallbackIntent

                 o IntentA

                 o IntentB

                 o IntentC

              voiceSettings -> (structure)
                 Defines settings for using an Amazon Polly voice to  communi-
                 cate with a user.

                 voiceId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the Amazon Polly voice to use.

                 engine -> (string)
                     Indicates  the type of Amazon Polly voice that Amazon Lex
                     should use for voice interaction with the user. For  more
                     information,  see  the  ` engine parameter of the Synthe-
                     sizeSpeech                  operation                  <-

       --merge-strategy (string)
          The  strategy  to  use  when  there  is  a name conflict between the
          imported resource and an existing resource. When the merge  strategy
          is  FailOnConflict  existing  resources  are not overwritten and the
          import fails.

          Possible values:

          o Overwrite

          o FailOnConflict

          o Append

       --file-password (string)
          The password used to encrypt  the  zip  archive  that  contains  the
          resource  definition.  You  should always encrypt the zip archive to
          protect it during transit between your site and Amazon Lex.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The time, in seconds, that Amazon Lex should keep information
                 about a user's conversation with the bot.

                 A  user  interaction  remains  active  for the amount of time
                 specified. If no conversation occurs during  this  time,  the
                 session  expires  and  Amazon  Lex  deletes any data provided
                 before the timeout.

                 You can specify between 60 (1 minute) and 86,400  (24  hours)
                 seconds.

              botTags -> (map)
                 A  list of tags to add to the bot. You can only add tags when
                 you import a bot. You can't use the  UpdateBot  operation  to
                 update tags. To update tags, use the TagResource operation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              testBotAliasTags -> (map)
                 A  list  of  tags to add to the test alias for a bot. You can
                 only add tags when you  import  a  bot.  You  can't  use  the
                 UpdateAlias  operation  to update tags. To update tags on the
                 test alias, use the TagResource operation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

          botLocaleImportSpecification -> (structure)
              Parameters for importing a bot locale.

              botId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the bot to import the locale to.

              botVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the bot to import the locale to. This can only
                 be the DRAFT version of the bot.

              localeId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of the language and locale that the bot will
                 be used in. The  string  must  match  one  of  the  supported
                 locales.  All  of  the intents, slot types, and slots used in
                 the bot must have the same locale. For more information,  see
                 Supported languages .

              nluIntentConfidenceThreshold -> (double)
                 Determines  the  threshold  where  Amazon Lex will insert the
                 AMAZON.FallbackIntent , AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent ,  or  both
                 when returning alternative intents. AMAZON.FallbackIntent and
                 AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent are only inserted if they are  con-
                 figured for the bot.

                 For  example, suppose a bot is configured with the confidence
                 threshold of 0.80 and the AMAZON.FallbackIntent . Amazon  Lex
                 returns  three  alternative intents with the following confi-
                 dence scores: IntentA (0.70), IntentB (0.60), IntentC (0.50).
                 The response from the PostText operation would be:

                 o AMAZON.FallbackIntent

                 o IntentA

                 o IntentB
