LIST-AGGREGATED-UTTERANCES()                      LIST-AGGREGATED-UTTERANCES()



NAME
       list-aggregated-utterances -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a list of utterances that users have sent to the bot.

       Utterances  are  aggregated  by the text of the utterance. For example,
       all instances where customers used the phrase "I want to  order  pizza"
       are aggregated into the same line in the response.

       You  can see both detected utterances and missed utterances. A detected
       utterance is where the bot properly recognized the utterance and  acti-
       vated  the  associated intent. A missed utterance was not recognized by
       the bot and didn't activate an intent.

       Utterances can be aggregated for a bot alias or for a bot version,  but
       not both at the same time.

       Utterances statistics are not generated under the following conditions:

       o The childDirected field was set to true when the bot was created.

       o You are using slot obfuscation with one or more slots.

       o You opted out of participating in improving Amazon Lex.

       --filters (list)
          Provides the specification of a filter used to limit the  utterances
          in  the  response to only those that match the filter specification.
          You can only specify one filter and one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters responses returned by the ListAggregatedUtterances oper-
              ation.

              operator -> (string)
                 The  operator  to  use  for  the  filter. Specify EQ when the
                 ListAggregatedUtterances operation should return only  utter-
                 ances  that  equal  the  specified value. Specify CO when the
                 ListAggregatedUtterances operation should  return  utterances
                 that contain the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Utterance",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of utterances to return in each page of results.
          If there are fewer results than the  maximum  page  size,  only  the
          actual  number  of  results  are  returned. If you don't specify the
          maxResults parameter, 1,000 results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListAggregatedUtterances operation contains
          more  results that specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is
          returned in the response. Use that token in the nextToken  parameter
          to return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)
          The identifier of the bot that contains the utterances.

       botAliasId -> (string)
          The identifier of the bot alias that contains the utterances. If you
          specified the bot version, the bot alias ID isn't returned.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The identifier of the bot version that contains the  utterances.  If
          you specified the bot alias, the bot version isn't returned.

       localeId -> (string)
          The  identifier  of  the language and locale that the utterances are
          in.

       aggregationDuration -> (structure)

              The desired time window for aggregating utterances.

              timeDimension -> (string)
                 The type of time period that the timeValue field  represents.

              timeValue -> (integer)
                 The  period  of the time window to gather statistics for. The
                 valid value depends  on  the  setting  of  the  timeDimension
                 field.

                 o Hours - 1/3/6/12/24

                 o Days - 3

                 o Weeks - 1/2

       aggregationWindowStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the aggregation window begins. Only data col-
          lected after this time is returned in the results.

       aggregationWindowEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the aggregation window ends. Only  data  col-
          lected  between  the start time and the end time are returned in the
          results.

       aggregationLastRefreshedDateTime -> (timestamp)
          The last date and time that the aggregated data was  collected.  The
          time period depends on the length of the aggregation window.

          o Hours  -  for 1 hour time window, every half hour; otherwise every
            hour.

          o Days - every 6 hours

          o Weeks - for a one week time window,  every  12  hours;  otherwise,
            every day

       aggregatedUtterancesSummaries -> (list)
          Summaries  of  the aggregated utterance data. Each response contains
          information about the number of times that the  utterance  was  seen
          during  the time period, whether it was detected or missed, and when
          it was seen during the time period.

          (structure)
              Provides summary  information  for  aggregated  utterances.  The
              ListAggregatedUtterances  operations  combines  all instances of
              the same utterance into a single aggregated summary.

              utterance -> (string)
                 The text of the utterance. If the utterance was used with the
                 RecognizeUtterance  operation,  the text is the transcription
                 of the audio utterance.

              hitCount -> (integer)
                 The number of times that the utterance was detected by Amazon
                 Lex during the time period. When an utterance is detected, it
                 activates an intent or a slot.

              missedCount -> (integer)
                 The number of times that the utterance was missed  by  Amazon
                 Lex An utterance is missed when it doesn't activate an intent
                 or slot.

              utteranceFirstRecordedInAggregationDuration -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the utterance was  first  recorded  in
                 the  time  window for aggregation. An utterance may have been
                 sent to Amazon Lex before  that  time,  but  only  utterances
                 within the time window are counted.

              utteranceLastRecordedInAggregationDuration -> (timestamp)
                 The  last date and time that an utterance was recorded in the
                 time window for aggregation. An utterance may be sent to Ama-
                 zon  Lex after that time, but only utterances within the time
                 window are counted.

              containsDataFromDeletedResources -> (boolean)
                 Aggregated utterance data may contain  utterances  from  ver-
                 sions  of  your  bot  that  have since been deleted. When the
                 aggregated contains this kind of data, this field is  set  to
                 true.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListAggregatedUtterances operation. If the nextToken
          field  is  present, you send the contents as the nextToken parameter
          of a ListAggregatedUtterances operation request to get the next page
          of results.
