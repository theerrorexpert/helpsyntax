BUILD-BOT-LOCALE()                                          BUILD-BOT-LOCALE()



NAME
       build-bot-locale -

DESCRIPTION
       Builds a bot, its intents, and its slot types into a specific locale. A
       bot can be built into multiple locales. At runtime the locale  is  used
       to choose a specific build of the bot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            build-bot-locale
          --bot-id <value>
          --bot-version <value>
          --locale-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the bot to build. The identifier is returned in
          the response from the CreateBot operation.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot to build. This can only be the draft  version
          of the bot.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier of the language and locale that the bot will be used
          in. The string must match one of the supported locales. All  of  the
          intents,  slot  types,  and slots used in the bot must have the same
          locale. For more information, see Supported languages .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)
          The identifier of the specified bot.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The version of the bot that was built. This is only the  draft  ver-
          sion of the bot.

       localeId -> (string)
          The language and locale specified of where the bot can be used.

       botLocaleStatus -> (string)
          The  bot's  build status. When the status is ReadyExpressTesting you
          can test the bot using the utterances defined for  the  intents  and
          slot  types. When the status is Built , the bot is ready for use and
          can be tested using any utterance.

       lastBuildSubmittedDateTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp indicating the date and time that the bot was last built
          for this locale.
