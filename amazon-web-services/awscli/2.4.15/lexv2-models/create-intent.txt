CREATE-INTENT()                                                CREATE-INTENT()



NAME
       create-intent -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an intent.

       To define the interaction between the user and your bot, you define one
       or more intents. For example, for a pizza ordering bot you would create
       an OrderPizza intent.

       When  you create an intent, you must provide a name. You can optionally
       provide the following:

       o Sample utterances. For example, "I want to order a pizza" and "Can  I
         order a pizza." You can't provide utterances for built-in intents.

       o Information  to  be  gathered.  You specify slots for the information
         that you bot requests from the user. You can  specify  standard  slot
         types,  such as date and time, or custom slot types for your applica-
         tion.

       o How the intent is fulfilled. You can provide  a  Lambda  function  or
         configure  the intent to return the intent information to your client
         application. If you use a Lambda function,  Amazon  Lex  invokes  the
         function when all of the intent information is available.

       o A  confirmation  prompt to send to the user to confirm an intent. For
         example, "Shall I order your pizza?"

       o A conclusion statement to send to the user after the intent  is  ful-
         filled. For example, "I ordered your pizza."

       o A  follow-up  prompt  that asks the user for additional activity. For
         example, "Do you want a drink with your pizza?"

OPTIONS
       --intent-name (string)
          The name of the intent. Intent names must be unique  in  the  locale
          that  contains  the intent and cannot match the name of any built-in
          intent.

       --description (string)
          A description of the intent. Use the description  to  help  identify
          the intent in lists.

       --parent-intent-signature (string)
          A  unique identifier for the built-in intent to base this intent on.

       --sample-utterances (list)
          An array of strings that a user might say to signal the intent.  For
          example, "I want a pizza", or "I want a {PizzaSize} pizza".

          In  an utterance, slot names are enclosed in curly braces ("{", "}")
          to indicate where they should be displayed in the utterance shown to
          the user..

          (structure)
              A  sample  utterance that invokes an intent or respond to a slot
              elicitation prompt.

              utterance -> (string)
                 The sample utterance  that  Amazon  Lex  uses  to  build  its
                 machine-learning model to recognize intents.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          utterance=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "utterance": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dialog-code-hook (structure)
          Specifies that Amazon Lex invokes the alias Lambda function for each
          user input. You can invoke this Lambda function to personalize  user
          interaction.

          For  example,  suppose that your bot determines that the user's name
          is John. You Lambda function might retrieve John's information  from
          a  backend database and prepopulate some of the values. For example,
          if you find that John is gluten intolerant, you might set the corre-
          sponding  intent  slot,  glutenIntolerant  to  true . You might find
          John's phone number and set the corresponding session attribute.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              Enables the dialog code hook so that it processes user requests.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "enabled": true|false
          }

       --fulfillment-code-hook (structure)
          Specifies that Amazon Lex invokes the alias Lambda function when the
          intent is ready for fulfillment. You can  invoke  this  function  to
          complete the bot's transaction with the user.

          For  example,  in a pizza ordering bot, the Lambda function can look
          up the closest pizza restaurant to the customer's location and  then
          place an order on the customer's behalf.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether a Lambda function should be invoked to fulfill
              a specific intent.

          postFulfillmentStatusSpecification -> (structure)
              Provides settings for messages sent to the user  for  after  the
              Lambda fulfillment function completes. Post-fulfillment messages

                     A collection of responses that Amazon Lex can send to the
                     user.  Amazon  Lex chooses the actual response to send at
                     runtime.

                     (structure)
                        Provides one or more messages that Amazon  Lex  should

                                      arrangement of the buttons is determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-
                                      ton.

       --intent-confirmation-setting (structure)
          Provides prompts that Amazon Lex sends to the user  to  confirm  the
          completion of an intent. If the user answers "no," the settings con-
          tain a statement that is sent to the user to end the intent.

          promptSpecification -> (structure)
              Prompts the user to confirm the  intent.  This  question  should
              have a yes or no answer.

              Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
              that the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with  the
              OrderPizza  intent,  you might want to confirm that the order is
              correct before placing it. For other intents,  such  as  intents
              that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask
              the user for confirmation before providing the information.

              messageGroups -> (list)
                 A collection of messages that Amazon  Lex  can  send  to  the
                 user.  Amazon  Lex chooses the actual message to send at run-
                 time.

                 (structure)
                     Provides one or more messages that Amazon Lex should send

                               The SSML text that defines the prompt.

                        imageResponseCard -> (structure)
                            A message that defines a response  card  that  the
                            client application can show to the user.

                            title -> (string)
                               The  title to display on the response card. The
                               format of the title is determined by the  plat-
                               form displaying the response card.

                            subtitle -> (string)

                               card. The image URL must be publicly  available
                               so  that  the  platform displaying the response

       --input-contexts (list)
          A list of contexts that must be active for this intent to be consid-
          ered by Amazon Lex.

          When  an intent has an input context list, Amazon Lex only considers
          using the intent in an interaction with the user when the  specified
          contexts are included in the active context list for the session. If
          the contexts are not active,  then  Amazon  Lex  will  not  use  the
          intent.

          A  context  can  be automatically activated using the outputContexts
          property or it can be set at runtime.

          For example, if there are two intents with different input  contexts
          that respond to the same utterances, only the intent with the active
          context will respond.

          An intent may have up to 5 input contexts. If an intent has multiple
          input  contexts,  all of the contexts must be active to consider the
          intent.

          (structure)
              The name of a context that must be active for an  intent  to  be
              selected by Amazon Lex.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the context.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --output-contexts (list)
          A  lists of contexts that the intent activates when it is fulfilled.

          You can use an output context to indicate the  intents  that  Amazon
          Lex  should  consider  for  the next turn of the conversation with a
          customer.

          When you use the outputContextsList property, all  of  the  contexts
          specified  in  the  list are activated when the intent is fulfilled.
          You can set up to 10 output contexts. You can also set the number of
          conversation  turns that the context should be active, or the length
          of time that the context should be active.

          (structure)
              Describes a session context that is activated when an intent  is
              fulfilled.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the output context.

              timeToLiveInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  time,  in  seconds,  that the output context
                 should remain active. The time is figured from the first time
                 the context is sent to the user.

              turnsToLive -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  conversation  turns  that the output context
                 should remain active. The number of turns is counted from the
                 first time that the context is sent to the user.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,timeToLiveInSeconds=integer,turnsToLive=integer ...

          kendraIndex -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Kendra  index  that
              you  want  the  AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent  intent to search. The
              index must be in the same account and Region as the  Amazon  Lex
              bot.

          queryFilterStringEnabled -> (boolean)
              Determines  whether  the AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent intent uses a
              custom query string to query the Amazon Kendra index.

          queryFilterString -> (string)
              A query filter that Amazon Lex sends to Amazon Kendra to  filter
              the  response  from a query. The filter is in the format defined
              by Amazon Kendra. For more information, see Filtering queries  .

          All  of the bots, slot types, and slots used by the intent must have
          the same locale. For more information, see Supported languages .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                                          response  card  used  to gather slot
                                          values from a user.

                                          text -> (string)

                                             ton.  Use  this  to tell the user
                                             what value is returned when  they
                                             choose this button.

                                          value -> (string)

                                             values configured for the slot.

                 allowInterrupt -> (boolean)

              Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
              that the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with  the
              OrderPizza  intent,  you might want to confirm that the order is
              correct before placing it. For other intents,  such  as  intents
              that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask
              the user for confirmation before providing the information.
