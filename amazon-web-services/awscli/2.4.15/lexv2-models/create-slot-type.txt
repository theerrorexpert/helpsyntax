OPTIONS
       --slot-type-name (string)
          The  name  for  the slot. A slot type name must be unique within the
          account.

       --description (string)
          A description of the slot type. Use the description to help identify
          the slot type in lists.

       --slot-type-values (list)
          A  list  of  SlotTypeValue  objects that defines the values that the
          slot type can take. Each value can have a list  of  synonyms,  addi-
          tional  values  that help train the machine learning model about the
          values that it resolves for a slot.

          (structure)
              Each slot type can have a set of values. Each SlotTypeValue rep-
              resents a value that the slot type can take.

              sampleValue -> (structure)
                 The value of the slot type entry.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value that can be used for a slot type.

              synonyms -> (list)
                 Additional values related to the slot type entry.

                 (structure)
                     Defines one of the values for a slot type.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value that can be used for a slot type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sampleValue={value=string},synonyms=[{value=string},{value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "sampleValue": {
                "value": "string"
              },
              "synonyms": [
                {
                  "value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --value-selection-setting (structure)
          Determines  the strategy that Amazon Lex uses to select a value from
          the list of possible values. The field can be set to one of the fol-
          lowing values:

          o OriginalValue - Returns the value entered by the user, if the user
            value is similar to the slot value.

          o TopResolution - If there is a resolution list for the slot, return
            the  first value in the resolution list. If there is no resolution
            list, return null.

          If  you  don't  specify  the  valueSelectionSetting  parameter,  the
          default is OriginalValue .

          resolutionStrategy -> (string)
              Determines  the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex uses to
              return slot type values. The field can be set to one of the fol-
              lowing values:

              o OriginalValue  - Returns the value entered by the user, if the
                user value is similar to the slot value.

              o TopResolution - If there is a resolution list  for  the  slot,
                return the first value in the resolution list as the slot type
                value. If there is no resolution list, null is returned.

              If you don't specify the valueSelectionStrategy, the default  is
              OriginalValue.

          regexFilter -> (structure)
              A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

              pattern -> (string)
                 A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

                 Use  a  standard  regular expression. Amazon Lex supports the
                 following characters in the regular expression:

                 o A-Z, a-z

                 o 0-9

                 o Unicode characters ("u<Unicode>")

                 "u0041" or "u005A".

                 The following regular expression operators are not supported:

                 o Infinite repeaters:
                   *
                   , +, or {x,} with no upper bound.

                 o Wild card (.)

              Provides settings that enable advanced recognition settings  for
              slot values.

              audioRecognitionStrategy -> (string)
                 Enables using the slot values as a custom vocabulary for rec-
                 ognizing user utterances.

          }

       --parent-slot-type-signature (string)
          The built-in slot type used as a parent of this slot type. When  you
          define  a  parent slot type, the new slot type has the configuration
          of the parent slot type.

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale that the slot type will be
          used  in. The string must match one of the supported locales. All of
          the bots, intents, and slots used by the slot  type  must  have  the
          same locale. For more information, see Supported languages .

       --external-source-setting (structure)
          Sets  the type of external information used to create the slot type.

          grammarSlotTypeSetting -> (structure)

                     source.

                 s3ObjectKey -> (string)
                     The path to the grammar in the S3 bucket.

                 kmsKeyArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon KMS key required to decrypt  the  contents  of
                     the grammar, if any.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          grammarSlotTypeSetting={source={s3BucketName=string,s3ObjectKey=string,kmsKeyArn=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "grammarSlotTypeSetting": {
              "source": {
                "s3BucketName": "string",

                "kmsKeyArn": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
