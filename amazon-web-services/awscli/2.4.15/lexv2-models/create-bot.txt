       Shorthand Syntax:

          childDirected=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "childDirected": true|false
          }

       --idle-session-ttl-in-seconds (integer)
          The  time, in seconds, that Amazon Lex should keep information about
          a user's conversation with the bot.

          A user interaction remains active for the amount of time  specified.
          If  no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and
          Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout.

          You can specify between 60 (1 minute) and 86,400 (24 hours) seconds.

       --bot-tags (map)
          A  list  of  tags  to add to the bot. You can only add tags when you
          create a bot. You can't use the UpdateBot operation to update  tags.
          To update tags, use the TagResource operation.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --test-bot-alias-tags (map)
          A  list of tags to add to the test alias for a bot. You can only add
          tags when you create a bot. You can't use the UpdateAlias  operation
          to  update  tags.  To  update tags on the test alias, use the TagRe-
          source operation.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
