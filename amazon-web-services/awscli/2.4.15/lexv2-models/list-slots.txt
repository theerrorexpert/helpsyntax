OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot that contains the slot.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the slot.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier of the language and locale of the slots to list. The
          string must match one of the supported locales.  For  more  informa-
          tion, see Supported languages .

       --intent-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the intent that contains the slot.

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines the sort order for the response from the ListSlots opera-
          tion. You can choose to sort by the slot name or last  updated  date
          in either ascending or descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list. You can choose ascending or descend-
              ing.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "SlotName"|"LastUpdatedDateTime",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --filters (list)
          Provides the specification of a filter used to limit  the  slots  in
          the  response to only those that match the filter specification. You
          can only specify one filter and only one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters the response from the ListSlots operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to use for filtering.

              values -> (list)
                 The value to use to filter the response.

                 (string)

              operator -> (string)
                 The operator to use for the filter. Specify EQ when the List-
                 Slots  operation  should  return  only aliases that equal the
                 specified value. Specify  CO  when  the  ListSlots  operation
                 should return aliases that contain the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "SlotName",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of slots to return in each page of results. If
          there are fewer results than the max page size, only the actual num-
          ber of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  response from the ListSlots operation contains more results
          than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is  returned  in
          the  response.  Use  that token in the nextToken parameter to return
          the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                   the platform displaying the response  card.

                                   that displays the button.

                                   (structure)

                                          is  returned  when  they choose this
                                          button.

                                          This must be one of the slot  values
                                          configured for the slot.

                            ations are defined, Amazon Lex chooses the primary
                            message  or  one  of the variations to send to the
                            user.

                                      card.  The format of the title is deter-
                                      mined by  the  platform  displaying  the

                                      displaying  the response card has access
                                      to the image.

                                      played   on   the   response  card.  The
                                      arrangement of the buttons is determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-
                                      ton.

                                             what value is returned when  they
                                             choose this button.

                 maxRetries -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of times the bot  tries  to  elicit  a
