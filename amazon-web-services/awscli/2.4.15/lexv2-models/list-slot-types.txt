OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot that contains the slot types.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the slot type.

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale of the slot types to list.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines  the  sort  order for the response from the ListSlotTypes
          operation. You can choose to sort by the  slot  type  name  or  last
          updated date in either ascending or descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of slot types.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list. You can say ascending or descending.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "SlotTypeName"|"LastUpdatedDateTime",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --filters (list)
          Provides the specification of a filter used to limit the slot  types
          in  the  response to only those that match the filter specification.
          You can only specify one filter and only one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters the response from the ListSlotTypes operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to use for filtering.

              values -> (list)
                 The value to use to filter the response.

                 (string)

              operator -> (string)
                 The operator to use for the filter. Specify EQ when the List-
                 SlotTypes operation should return only aliases that equal the
                 specified value. Specify CO when the ListSlotTypes  operation
                 should return aliases that contain the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "SlotTypeName"|"ExternalSourceType",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of slot types to return in each page of results.
          If there are fewer results than the max page size, only  the  actual
          number of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  response  from  the  ListSlotTypes  operation contains more
          results than specified in  the  maxResults  parameter,  a  token  is
          returned  in the response. Use that token in the nextToken parameter
          to return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)
          The identifier of the bot that contains the slot types.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the slot types.

       localeId -> (string)
          The language and local of the slot types in the list.

       slotTypeSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information for the slot types that meet the filter criteria
          specified in the request. The length of the list is specified in the
          maxResults parameter of the request. If there are  more  slot  types
          available, the nextToken field contains a token to get the next page
          of results.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about a slot type.

              slotTypeId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier assigned to the slot type.

              slotTypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the slot type.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the slot type.

              parentSlotTypeSignature -> (string)
                 If the slot type is derived from a built-on  slot  type,  the
                 name of the parent slot type.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp of the date and time that the slot type was last
                 updated.

              slotTypeCategory -> (string)
                 Indicates the type of the slot type.

                 o Custom - A slot type that you created using custom  values.
                   For more information, see Creating custom slot types .

                 o Extended  -  A  slot  type  created  by  extending the AMA-
                   ZON.AlphaNumeric built-in slot type. For more  information,
                   see AMAZON.AlphaNumeric .

                 o ExternalGrammar  - A slot type using a custom GRXML grammar
                   to define values. For more information, see Using a  custom
                   grammar slot type .

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListSlotTypes operation. If the nextToken  field  is
          present, you send the contents as the nextToken parameter of a List-
          SlotTypes operation request to get the next page of results.
