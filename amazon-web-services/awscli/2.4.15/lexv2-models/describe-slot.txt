DESCRIPTION
       Gets metadata information about a slot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-slot
          --slot-id <value>
          --bot-id <value>
          --bot-version <value>
          --locale-id <value>
          --intent-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --slot-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the slot.

       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the slot.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the slot.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the language and locale of the slot to describe.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --intent-id (string)
          The identifier of the intent that contains the slot.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                               so  that  the  platform displaying the response
                               card has access to the image.

                               tons is determined by the  platform  that  dis-
                               plays the button.

                     variations -> (list)
                        Message variations to send to the  user.  When  varia-

                                   mined  by  the  platform   displaying   the
                                   response card.

                               imageUrl -> (string)

                                   licly  available  so that the platform dis-
                                   playing the response card has access to the
                                   image.

                                   on the response card.  The  arrangement  of
                                   the  buttons  is determined by the platform
                                   that displays the button.

                                   (structure)
                                      Describes a button to use on a  response
                                      card  used  to gather slot values from a
                                      user.

                                      text -> (string)
                                          The text that appears on the button.
                                          Use this to tell the user what value
                                          is returned when  they  choose  this
                                          button.

                                      value -> (string)

                                          when the user chooses  this  button.
                                          This  must be one of the slot values
                                          configured for the slot.

              maxRetries -> (integer)

                 Indicates whether the user can interrupt a speech prompt from
                 the bot.

          sampleUtterances -> (list)
              If you know a specific pattern that users might  respond  to  an

              utterances to improve accuracy. This is optional. In most cases,
              Amazon Lex is capable of understanding user utterances.

              (structure)

                     A collection of responses that Amazon Lex can send to the

                        Provides  one  or more messages that Amazon Lex should

              Indicates whether a slot can return multiple values. When true ,
              the  slot  may  return  more  than one value in a response. When
              false , the slot returns only a single value.

              Multi-value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
              set  this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a
              ValidationException .

              If the allowMutlipleValues is not  set,  the  default  value  is
              false .
