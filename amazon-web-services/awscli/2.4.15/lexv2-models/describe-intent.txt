NAME
       describe-intent -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata about an intent.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-intent
          --intent-id <value>
          --bot-id <value>
          --bot-version <value>
          --locale-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --intent-id (string)
          The identifier of the intent to describe.

       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the intent.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the intent.

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale of the intent to describe.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                      displaying  the response card has access

                                      arrangement of the buttons is determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-

                                      arrangement of the buttons is determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-
                                      ton.

                                             what value is returned when  they
                                             choose this button.

                 allowInterrupt -> (boolean)

              have a yes or no answer.

              Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
              that  the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with the
              OrderPizza intent, you might want to confirm that the  order  is
              correct  before  placing  it. For other intents, such as intents
              that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask

                               so that the platform  displaying  the  response
                               card has access to the image.
