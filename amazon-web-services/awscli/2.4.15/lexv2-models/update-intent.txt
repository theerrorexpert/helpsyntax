       --slot-priorities (list)
          A new list of slots and their priorities that are contained  by  the
          intent.

          (structure)
              Sets the priority that Amazon Lex should use when eliciting slot
              values from a user.

              priority -> (integer)
                 The priority that a slot should be elicited.

              slotId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the slot.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          priority=integer,slotId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "priority": integer,
              "slotId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --intent-confirmation-setting (structure)
          New prompts that Amazon Lex sends to the user to confirm the comple-
          tion of an intent.

          promptSpecification -> (structure)
              Prompts  the  user  to  confirm the intent. This question should
              have a yes or no answer.

              Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
              that  the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with the
              OrderPizza intent, you might want to confirm that the  order  is
              correct  before  placing  it. For other intents, such as intents
              that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask
              the user for confirmation before providing the information.

              messageGroups -> (list)
                 A  collection  of  messages  that  Amazon Lex can send to the
                 user. Amazon Lex chooses the actual message to send  at  run-
                 time.

                 (structure)
                     Provides one or more messages that Amazon Lex should send
                     to the user.

                     message -> (structure)
                        The primary message that Amazon Lex should send to the
                        user.

                        plainTextMessage -> (structure)
                            A message in plain text format.

                            value -> (string)

                            A message in a custom format defined by the client
                            application.

                            value -> (string)
                               The string that is sent to your application.

                        ssmlMessage -> (structure)
                            A message  in  Speech  Synthesis  Markup  Language
                            (SSML).

                            value -> (string)
                               The SSML text that defines the prompt.

                        imageResponseCard -> (structure)
                            A  message  that  defines a response card that the
                            client application can show to the user.

                            title -> (string)
                               The title to display on the response card.  The
                               format  of the title is determined by the plat-
                               form displaying the response card.

                               The format of the subtitle is determined by the

                            imageUrl -> (string)
                               The URL of an image to display on the  response
                               card.  The image URL must be publicly available
                               so that the platform  displaying  the  response
                               card has access to the image.

                            buttons -> (list)
                               A  list  of buttons that should be displayed on
                               the response card. The arrangement of the  but-
                               tons  is  determined  by the platform that dis-
                               plays the button.

                               (structure)

                                   card  used  to  gather  slot  values from a
                                   user.

                                   text -> (string)
                                      The text that appears on the button. Use
                                      this  to  tell  the  user  what value is
                                      returned when they choose this button.

                                          The text that appears on the button.
                                          Use this to tell the user what value

                                          button.

                                      value -> (string)

                                          when  the  user chooses this button.
                                          This must be one of the slot  values
                                          configured for the slot.

              allowInterrupt -> (boolean)

              Specifies whether an intent's closing  response  is  used.  When
              this  field  is  false,  the  closing response isn't sent to the
              user. If the active field isn't specified, the default is  true.

       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not

       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

          promptSpecification -> (structure)
              Prompts the user to confirm the  intent.  This  question  should
              have a yes or no answer.

              Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
              that the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with  the
              OrderPizza  intent,  you might want to confirm that the order is
              correct before placing it. For other intents,  such  as  intents
              that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask
              the user for confirmation before providing the information.
