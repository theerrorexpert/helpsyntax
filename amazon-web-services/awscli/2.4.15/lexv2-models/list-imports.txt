OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier that Amazon Lex assigned to the bot.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot to list imports for.

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines the field that the list of imports is sorted by. You  can
          sort  by  the  LastUpdatedDateTime  field in ascending or descending
          order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The export field to use for sorting.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "LastUpdatedDateTime",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --filters (list)
          Provides the specification of a filter used to limit the bots in the
          response  to only those that match the filter specification. You can
          only specify one filter and one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters the response from the ListImports operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to use for filtering.

              values -> (list)
                 The values to use to filter the response. The values must  be
                 Bot , BotLocale , or CustomVocabulary .

                 (string)

              operator -> (string)
                 The  operator  to  use  for  the  filter. Specify EQ when the
                 ListImports operation should return only resource types  that
                 equal  the  specified  value. Specify CO when the ListImports
                 operation should return resource types that contain the spec-
                 ified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "ImportResourceType",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of imports to return in each page of results. If
          there are fewer results than the max page size, only the actual num-
          ber of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListImports operation contains more results
          than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is  returned  in
          the response.

          Use  the  returned token in the nextToken parameter of a ListImports
          request to return the next page of results. For a  complete  set  of
          results, call the ListImports operation until the nextToken returned
          in the response is null.

       --locale-id (string)
          Specifies the locale that should be present  in  the  list.  If  you
          don't  specify  a  resource  type in the filters parameter, the list
          contains both bot locales and custom vocabularies.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          specified in the request. The length of the list is specified in the
          maxResults parameter. If there are more imports available, the next-
          Token field contains a token to get the next page of results.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about an import in an import  list.

              importId -> (string)

              importedResourceId -> (string)

              mergeStrategy -> (string)
                 The strategy used to merge existing bot or bot locale defini-
                 tions with the imported definition.

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the import was created.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the import was last updated.

              importedResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource that was imported.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListImports operation. If  the  nextToken  field  is
          present,  you  send  the  contents  as  the nextToken parameter of a
          ListImports operation request to get the next page of results.

       localeId -> (string)
          The locale specified in the request.
