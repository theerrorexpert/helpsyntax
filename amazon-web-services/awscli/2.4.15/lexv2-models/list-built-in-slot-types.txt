NAME
       list-built-in-slot-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of built-in slot types that meet the specified criteria.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-built-in-slot-types
          --locale-id <value>
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale of the slot types to list.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines the sort order for the response from the ListBuiltInSlot-
          Types operation. You can choose to sort by the slot  type  signature
          in either ascending or descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of built-in intents.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list. You can choose ascending or descend-
              ing.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "SlotTypeSignature",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of built-in slot types to return in each page  of
          results. If there are fewer results than the max page size, only the
          actual number of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from  the  ListBuiltInSlotTypes  operation  contains
          more  results than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is
          returned in the response. Use that token in the nextToken  parameter
          to return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       builtInSlotTypeSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information for the built-in slot types that meet the filter
          criteria specified in the request. The length of the list is  speci-
          fied  in  the maxResults parameter of the request. If there are more
          slot types available, the nextToken field contains a  token  to  get
          the next page of results.

          (structure)
              Provides  summary information about a built-in slot type for the
              ListBuiltInSlotTypes operation.

              slotTypeSignature -> (string)
                 The signature of the built-in slot type. Use this to  specify
                 the parent slot type of a derived slot type.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the built-in slot type.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListBuiltInSlotTypes  operation.  If  the  nextToken
          field  is  present, you send the contents as the nextToken parameter
          of a LIstBuiltInSlotTypes operation request to get the next page  of
          results.

       localeId -> (string)
          The language and locale of the slot types in the list.
