DELETE-RESOURCE-POLICY-STATEMENT()          DELETE-RESOURCE-POLICY-STATEMENT()



NAME
       delete-resource-policy-statement -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  policy  statement from a resource policy. If you delete the
       last statement from a policy, the policy is deleted. If you  specify  a
       statement  ID  that  doesn't  exist in the policy, or if the bot or bot
       alias doesn't have a policy attached, Amazon Lex returns an  exception.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-resource-policy-statement
          --resource-arn <value>
          --statement-id <value>
          [--expected-revision-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the bot or bot alias that the
          resource policy is attached to.

       --statement-id (string)
          The name of the statement (SID) to delete from the policy.

       --expected-revision-id (string)
          The identifier of the revision of the policy to delete the statement
          from.  If  this  revision  ID doesn't match the current revision ID,
          Amazon Lex throws an exception.

          If you don't specify a revision, Amazon Lex removes the current con-
          tents of the statement.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       resourceArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the bot or bot alias that the
          resource policy statement was removed from.

       revisionId -> (string)
          The current revision of the resource policy. Use the revision ID  to
          make  sure  that  you  are  updating  the  most current version of a
          resource policy when you add  a  policy  statement  to  a  resource,
          delete a resource, or update a resource.
