       --obfuscation-setting (structure)
          New  settings that determine how slot values are formatted in Amazon
          CloudWatch logs.

          obfuscationSettingType -> (string)
              Value that determines whether Amazon Lex obscures slot values in
              conversation logs. The default is to obscure the values.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          obfuscationSettingType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "obfuscationSettingType": "None"|"DefaultObfuscation"
          }

       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot that contains the slot.

       --bot-version (string)
          The  version of the bot that contains the slot. Must always be DRAFT
          .

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale that  contains  the  slot.
          The  string must match one of the supported locales. For more infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --intent-id (string)
          The identifier of the intent that contains the slot.

       --multiple-values-setting (structure)
          Determines whether the slot accepts multiple values in one response.
          Multiple  value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
          set this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a Val-
          idationException .

          If  the multipleValuesSetting is not set, the default value is false
          .

          allowMultipleValues -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether a slot can return multiple values. When true ,
              the  slot  may  return  more  than one value in a response. When
              false , the slot returns only a single value.

              Multi-value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
              set  this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a
              ValidationException .

              If the allowMutlipleValues is not  set,  the  default  value  is
              false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          allowMultipleValues=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "allowMultipleValues": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                      displaying the response card has  access
                                      to the image.

                                      arrangement of the buttons is determined
                                      by the platform that displays  the  but-

                 frequencyInSeconds -> (integer)

          Indicates whether the slot accepts multiple values in one  response.

          allowMultipleValues -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether a slot can return multiple values. When true ,
              the slot may return more than one  value  in  a  response.  When
              false , the slot returns only a single value.

              Multi-value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
              set this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws  a
              ValidationException .

              If  the  allowMutlipleValues  is  not  set, the default value is
              false .
