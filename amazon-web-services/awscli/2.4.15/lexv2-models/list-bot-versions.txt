LIST-BOT-VERSIONS()                                        LIST-BOT-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-bot-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about all of the versions of a bot.

       The  ListBotVersions  operation  returns a summary of each version of a
       bot. For example, if a bot has three numbered versions, the ListBotVer-
       sions  operation  returns  for summaries, one for each numbered version
       and one for the DRAFT version.

       The ListBotVersions operation always returns at least one version,  the
       DRAFT version.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-bot-versions
          --bot-id <value>
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot to list versions for.

       --sort-by (structure)
          Specifies sorting parameters for the list of versions. You can spec-
          ify that the list be sorted by version name in either  ascending  or
          descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of versions.

          order -> (string)
              The  order  to  sort  the  list.  You  can  specify ascending or
              descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "BotVersion",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of versions to return in each page of results. If
          there are fewer results than the max page size, only the actual num-
          ber of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the  response  to  the  ListBotVersion  operation  contains  more
          results  than  specified  in  the  maxResults  parameter, a token is
          returned in the response. Use that token in the nextToken  parameter
          to return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)
          The identifier of the bot to list versions for.

       botVersionSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information for the bot versions that meet the filter crite-
          ria specified in the request. The length of the list is specified in
          the  maxResults parameter of the request. If there are more versions
          available, the nextToken field contains a token to get the next page
          of results.

          (structure)
              Summary   information  about  a  bot  version  returned  by  the
              ListBotVersions operation.

              botName -> (string)
                 The name of the bot associated with the version.

              botVersion -> (string)
                 The numeric version of the bot, or  DRAFT  to  indicate  that
                 this is the version of the bot that can be updated..

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the version.

              botStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the bot. When the status is available, the ver-
                 sion of the bot is ready for use.

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp of the date and time that the  version  was  cre-
                 ated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListBotVersions operation. If the nextToken field is
          present, you send the contents as the nextToken parameter of a List-
          BotAliases operation request to get the next page of results.
