OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the bot containing the bot recommendation
          to be updated.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot  containing  the  bot  recommendation  to  be
          updated.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier of the language and locale of the bot recommendation
          to update. The string must match one of the supported  locales.  For
          more information, see Supported languages

       --bot-recommendation-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot recommendation to be updated.

       --encryption-setting (structure)
          The  object  representing the passwords that will be used to encrypt
          the data related to the bot recommendation results, as well  as  the
          KMS key ARN used to encrypt the associated metadata.

          kmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The KMS key ARN used to encrypt the metadata associated with the
              bot recommendation.

          botLocaleExportPassword -> (string)
              The password used to encrypt the recommended bot  recommendation
              file.

          associatedTranscriptsPassword -> (string)
              The password used to encrypt the associated transcript file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          kmsKeyArn=string,botLocaleExportPassword=string,associatedTranscriptsPassword=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "kmsKeyArn": "string",
            "botLocaleExportPassword": "string",
            "associatedTranscriptsPassword": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
