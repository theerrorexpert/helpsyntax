DESCRIPTION
       Systems  Manager  Incident  Manager  is  an incident management console
       designed to help users mitigate and recover  from  incidents  affecting
       their  Amazon  Web  Services-hosted  applications.  An  incident is any
       unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of services.

       Incident Manager increases incident resolution by notifying  responders
       of  impact,  highlighting  relevant troubleshooting data, and providing
       collaboration tools to get services back up and running. To achieve the
       primary  goal of reducing the time-to-resolution of critical incidents,
       Incident Manager automates response plans and  enables  responder  team
       escalation.
