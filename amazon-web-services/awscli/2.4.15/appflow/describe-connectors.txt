NAME
       describe-connectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the connectors vended by Amazon AppFlow for specified connec-
       tor types. If you  don't  specify  a  connector  type,  this  operation
       describes  all  connectors  vended by Amazon AppFlow. If there are more
       connectors than can be returned in one page, the  response  contains  a
       nextToken  object,  which  can  be be passed in to the next call to the
       DescribeConnectors API operation to retrieve the next page.

            Salesforce
            Singular
            Slack
            Redshift
            S3

            SAPOData

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token for the next page of data.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
