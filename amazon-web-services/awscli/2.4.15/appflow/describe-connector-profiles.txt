NAME
       describe-connector-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of connector-profile details matching the provided con-
       nector-profile  names  and  connector-types  .  Both  input  lists  are
       optional, and you can use them to filter the result.

       If no names or connector-types are provided, returns all connector pro-
       files in a paginated form. If there is no match, this operation returns
       an empty list.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-connector-profiles
          [--connector-profile-names <value>]
          [--connector-type <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connector-profile-names (list)
          The  name of the connector profile. The name is unique for each Con-
          nectorProfile in the Amazon Web Services account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --connector-type (string)
          The type of connector, such as Salesforce, Amplitude, and so on.

          Possible values:

          o Salesforce

          o Singular

          o Slack

          o Redshift

          o S3

          o Marketo

          o Googleanalytics

          o Zendesk

          o Servicenow

          o Datadog

          o Trendmicro

          o Snowflake

          o Dynatrace

          o Infornexus

          o Amplitude

          o Veeva

          o EventBridge

          o LookoutMetrics

          o Upsolver

          o Honeycode

          o CustomerProfiles

          o SAPOData

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the
          result  set. The default for maxResults is 20 (for all paginated API
          operations).

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token for the next page of data.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
