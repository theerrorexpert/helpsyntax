NAME
       describe-flow-execution-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Fetches the execution history of the flow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-flow-execution-records
          --flow-name <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --flow-name (string)
          The  specified  name of the flow. Spaces are not allowed. Use under-
          scores (_) or hyphens (-) only.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the
          result  set. The default for maxResults is 20 (for all paginated API
          operations).

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token for the next page of data.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              executionResult -> (structure)
                 Describes the result of the given flow run.

                 errorInfo -> (structure)
                     Provides any error message  information  related  to  the
                     flow run.

                     putFailuresCount -> (long)
                        Specifies the failure count for the attempted flow.

                     executionMessage -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  error  message  that appears if a flow
                        fails.

                 bytesProcessed -> (long)
                     The total number of bytes processed by the flow run.

                 bytesWritten -> (long)
                     The total number of bytes written as a result of the flow
                     run.

                 recordsProcessed -> (long)
                     The number of records processed in the flow run.

              startedAt -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the start time of the flow run.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)

              dataPullStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp that determines the first new or updated record
                 to be transferred in the flow run.

              dataPullEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp that indicates the last new or  updated  record
                 to be transferred in the flow run.

       nextToken -> (string)
