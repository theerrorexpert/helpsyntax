NAME
       list-connector-entities -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  list  of available connector entities supported by Amazon
       AppFlow. For example, you can query Salesforce for Account and Opportu-
       nity entities, or query ServiceNow for the Incident entity.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-connector-entities
          [--connector-profile-name <value>]
          [--connector-type <value>]
          [--entities-path <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connector-profile-name (string)
          The  name of the connector profile. The name is unique for each Con-
          nectorProfile in the Amazon Web Services account,  and  is  used  to
          query the downstream connector.

       --connector-type (string)
          The type of connector, such as Salesforce, Amplitude, and so on.

       --entities-path (string)
          This  optional  parameter  is  specific to connector implementation.
          Some connectors support multiple levels or categories  of  entities.
          You  can  find out the list of roots for such providers by sending a
          request without the entitiesPath parameter. If  the  connector  sup-
          ports  entities at different roots, this initial request returns the
          list of roots. Otherwise, this request  returns  all  entities  sup-
          ported by the provider.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       connectorEntityMap -> (map)
          The response of ListConnectorEntities lists entities grouped by cat-
          egory. This map's key represents the group name, and its value  con-
          tains the list of entities belonging to that group.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 The  high-level entity that can be queried in Amazon AppFlow.
                 For example, a Salesforce  entity  might  be  an  Account  or
                 Opportunity  ,  whereas a ServiceNow entity might be an Inci-
                 dent .

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the connector entity.

                 label -> (string)
                     The label applied to the connector entity.

                 hasNestedEntities -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the connector entity is a parent  or  a
                     category  and  has more entities nested underneath it. If
                     another  call  is  made  with  entitiesPath  =  "the_cur-
                     rent_entity_name_with_hasNestedEntities_true"  ,  then it
                     returns the nested entities underneath it. This  provides
                     a  way  to retrieve all supported entities in a recursive
                     fashion.
