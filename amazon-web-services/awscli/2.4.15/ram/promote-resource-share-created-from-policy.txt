PROMOTE-RESOURCE-SHARE-CREATED-FROPROMOTE-RESOURCE-SHARE-CREATED-FROM-POLICY()



NAME
       promote-resource-share-created-from-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       When  you  attach  a resource-based permission policy to a resource, it
       automatically creates a resource share. However, resource  shares  cre-
       ated  this  way  are  visible only to the resource share owner, and the
       resource share can't be modified in RAM.

       You can use this operation to promote the resource share to a full  RAM
       resource  share. When you promote a resource share, you can then manage
       the resource share in RAM and it becomes visible to all of the  princi-
       pals you shared it with.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            promote-resource-share-created-from-policy
          --resource-share-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resoure  Name (ARN) of the resource share to
          promote.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To promote a resource-policy based resource share to full functionality
       in AWS RAM

       The  following promote-resource-share-created-from-policy example takes
       a  resource  share  that  you  created  implicitly   by   attaching   a
       resource-based  policy, and converts it to be fully functional with the
       AWS RAM console and its CLI and API operations.

          aws ram promote-resource-share-created-from-policy \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/91fa8429-2d06-4032-909a-90909EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "returnValue": true
          }

OUTPUT
       returnValue -> (boolean)
          A return value of true indicates that the request succeeded. A value
          of false indicates that the request failed.
