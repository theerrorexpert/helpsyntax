NAME
       list-permission-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the available versions of the specified RAM permission.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-permission-versions
          --permission-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --permission-arn (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the RAM permission whose
          versions you want to list. You can use the permissionVersion parame-
          ter  on the  AssociateResourceSharePermission operation to specify a
          non-default version to attach.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies that you want to receive the next page of  results.  Valid
          only  if  you received a NextToken response in the previous request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output  is  available.  Set  this
          parameter  to  the  value  provided by the previous call's NextToken
          response to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each
          page  of  the  response.  If  you  do not include this parameter, it
          defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional
          items  exist  beyond  the number you specify, the NextToken response
          element is returned with a value (not null). Include  the  specified
          value  as  the  NextToken  request parameter in the next call to the
          operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service
          might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
          results available. You should check NextToken after every  operation
          to ensure that you receive all of the results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       permissions -> (list)
          An  array  of objects that contain details for each of the available
          versions.

          (structure)
              Information about an RAM permission that is  associated  with  a
              resource share and any of its resources of a specified type.

              arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resoure  Name  (ARN)  of the permission you want
                 information about.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of the permission represented in this  structure.

              defaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the version of the permission represented
                 in this structure is the default version for this permission.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of this permission.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to which this permission applies.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the permission.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was created.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was last updated.

              isResourceTypeDefault -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the version of the permission represented
                 in this structure is the default version for all resources of
                 this resource type.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
