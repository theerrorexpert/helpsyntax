NAME
       list-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  resources  that  you  added  to  a  resource  shares or the
       resources that are shared with you.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resources is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: resources

OPTIONS
       --resource-owner (string)
          Specifies  that you want to list only the resource shares that match
          the following:

          o
            **
            SELF **  resources that you are sharing

          o
            **
            OTHER-ACCOUNTS **  resources that other accounts share with you

       --principal (string)
          Specifies that you want to list only the resource  shares  that  are
          associated with the specified principal.

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies  that  you  want  to  list  only  the resource shares that
          include resources of the specified resource type.

          For valid values, query the  ListResourceTypes operation.

       --resource-arns (list)
          Specifies that you want  to  list  only  the  resource  shares  that
          include  resources with the specified Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-share-arns (list)
          Specifies that you want to  list  only  resources  in  the  resource
          shares identified by the specified Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) .

       --resource-region-scope (string)
          Specifies  that  you want the results to include only resources that
          have the specified scope.

          o ALL  the results include both global  and  regional  resources  or
            resource types.

          o GLOBAL   the  results  include  only  global resources or resource
            types.

          o REGIONAL  the results include only regional resources or  resource

          o ALL

          o REGIONAL

          o GLOBAL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the resources associated with a resource share

       The following list-resources example lists all resources in the  speci-
       fied resource share that are of the specified resource type.

          aws ram list-resources \
              --resource-type ec2:Subnet \
              --resource-owner SELF \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resources": [
                  {
                      "arn": "aarn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:subnet/subnet-0250c25a1f4e15235",
                      "type": "ec2:Subnet",
                      "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE",
                      "creationTime": 1565301545.023,
                      "lastUpdatedTime": 1565301545.947
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resources -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain information about the resources.

          (structure)
              Describes a resource associated with a resource share in RAM.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource.

              type -> (string)
                 The  resource  type.  This  takes  the  form of: service-code
                 :resource-code

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN)  of  the  resource  share  this
                 resource is associated with.

              resourceGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resoure  Name  (ARN) of the resource group. This
                 value is available only if the resource is part of a resource
                 group.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the resource.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the resource.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time when the resource was associated with the
                 resource share.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date an time when the association was last updated.

              resourceRegionScope -> (string)
                 Specifies the scope of visibility of this resource:

                 o REGIONAL  The  resource  can  be  accessed  only  by  using
                   requests  that  target  the  Amazon  Web Services Region in
                   which the resource exists.

                 o GLOBAL  The resource can be accessed from  any  Amazon  Web
                   Services Region.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
