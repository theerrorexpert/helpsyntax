ENABLE-SHARING-WITH-AWS-ORGANIZATION()  ENABLE-SHARING-WITH-AWS-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       enable-sharing-with-aws-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  resource  sharing  within  your organization in Organizations.
       Calling this operation enables RAM to retrieve  information  about  the
       organization  and its structure. This lets you share resources with all
       of the accounts in an organization by specifying the organization's ID,
       or all of the accounts in an organizational unit (OU) by specifying the
       OU's ID. Until you enable sharing  within  the  organization,  you  can
       specify  only individual Amazon Web Services accounts, or for supported
       resource types, IAM users and roles.

       You must call this operation from an IAM user or role in the  organiza-
       tion's management account.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-sharing-with-aws-organization
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
