CREATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()                                CREATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()



NAME
       create-resource-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a resource share. You can provide a list of the Amazon Resource
       Names (ARNs) for the resources that you want to share, a list of  prin-
       cipals  you  want  to  share the resources with, and the permissions to
       grant those principals.

       NOTE:
          Sharing a resource makes it available for use by principals  outside
          of  the Amazon Web Services account that created the resource. Shar-
          ing doesn't change any permissions  or  quotas  that  apply  to  the
          resource in the account that created it.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of the resource share.

       --resource-arns (list)
          Specifies  a  list of one or more ARNs of the resources to associate
          with the resource share.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --principals (list)
          Specifies a list of one or more principals  to  associate  with  the
          resource share.

          You can include the following values:

          o An Amazon Web Services account ID, for example: 123456789012

          o An  Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of an organization in Organizations,
            for  example:  organizations::123456789012:organization/o-example-
            orgid

          o An  ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations, for exam-
            ple:     organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-example-
            rootid-exampleouid123

            name

          o An ARN of an IAM user, for example: iam::123456789012user/username

          NOTE:
              Not  all  resource types can be shared with IAM roles and users.
              For more information, see Sharing with IAM roles  and  users  in
              the Resource Access Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Specifies  one  or more tags to attach to the resource share itself.
          It doesn't attach the tags to  the  resources  associated  with  the
          resource share.

          (structure)
              A  structure  containing  a  tag. A tag is metadata that you can
              attach to your resources to help organize and  categorize  them.
              You  can  also  use  them to help you secure your resources. For
              more information, see Controlling access to Amazon Web  Services
              resources using tags .

              For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have  a
                 key. Key names are case sensitive.

              value -> (string)
                 The  string  value  attached  to the tag. The value can be an
                 empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --allow-external-principals | --no-allow-external-principals (boolean)
          Specifies whether principals outside your organization in  Organiza-
          tions  can be associated with a resource share. A value of true lets
          you share with individual Amazon Web Services accounts that are  not
          in  your  organization.  A  value  of false only has meaning if your
          account is a member of an  Amazon  Web  Services  Organization.  The
          default value is true .

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies  a  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to
          ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets  you  safely  retry
          the  request  without  accidentally  performing the same operation a
          second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an  operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services  generates
          a random one for you.

       --permission-arns (list)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the RAM permission to
          associate with the resource share. If you do not specify an ARN  for
          the  permission,  RAM  automatically attaches the default version of
          the permission for each resource type. You can  associate  only  one
          permission with each resource type included in the resource share.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a resource share

       The  following  create-resource-share example creates an empty resource
       share with the specified name. You must separately add resources, prin-
       cipals, and permissions to the share.

          aws ram create-resource-share \
              --name MyNewResourceShare

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShare": {
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/4476c27d-8feb-4b21-afe9-7de23EXAMPLE",
                  "name": "MyNewResourceShare",
                  "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "allowExternalPrincipals": true,
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "creationTime": 1634586271.302,
                  "lastUpdatedTime": 1634586271.302
              }
          }

       Example 2: To create a resource share with AWS accounts as principals

       The  following  create-resource-share  example creates a resource share
       and grants access to the specified AWS account (222222222222).  If  the
       specified  principals  are  not part of the same AWS Organization, then
       invitations are sent and must be accepted before access is granted.

          aws ram create-resource-share \
              --name MyNewResourceShare \
              --principals 222222222222

       Example 3: To create a resource share restricted to your AWS  Organiza-
       tion

       The  following  create-resource-share  example creates a resource share
       that is restricted to  accounts  in  the  AWS  Organization  that  your
       account  is  a member of, and adds the specified OU as a principal. All
       accounts in that OU can use the resources in the resource share.

          aws ram create-resource-share \
              --name MyNewResourceShare \
              --no-allow-external-principals \
              --principals arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-63bEXAMPLE/ou-46xi-rEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShare": {
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7be8694e-095c-41ca-9ce8-7be4aEXAMPLE",
                  "name": "MyNewResourceShare",
                  "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "allowExternalPrincipals": false,
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "creationTime": 1634587042.49,
                  "lastUpdatedTime": 1634587042.49
              }
          }

                resource-based  permission  policy  attached  to the resource.
                This type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon  Web
                Services  account  that created it. You can't modify it in RAM
                unless you promote it. For more information,  see   PromoteRe-
                sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  -  The resource share is in the process
                of being promoted. For more information, see  PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o STANDARD  -  Indicates  that the resource share was created in
                RAM using the console or APIs. These resource shares are visi-
                ble  to  all principals you share the resource share with. You
                can modify these resource shares in RAM using the  console  or
                APIs.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
