NAME
       list-pending-invitation-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the resources in a resource share that is shared with you but for
       which the invitation is still PENDING . That  means  that  you  haven't
       accepted  or rejected the invitation and the invitation hasn't expired.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-pending-invitation-resources
          --resource-share-invitation-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--resource-region-scope <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-invitation-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the invitation.  You  can
          use   GetResourceShareInvitations to find the ARN of the invitation.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies that you want to receive the next page of  results.  Valid
          only  if  you received a NextToken response in the previous request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output  is  available.  Set  this
          parameter  to  the  value  provided by the previous call's NextToken
          response to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each
          page  of  the  response.  If  you  do not include this parameter, it
          defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional
          items  exist  beyond  the number you specify, the NextToken response
          element is returned with a value (not null). Include  the  specified
          value  as  the  NextToken  request parameter in the next call to the
          operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service
          might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
          results available. You should check NextToken after every  operation
          to ensure that you receive all of the results.

       --resource-region-scope (string)
          Specifies  that  you want the results to include only resources that
          have the specified scope.

          o ALL  the results include both global  and  regional  resources  or
            resource types.

          o GLOBAL   the  results  include  only  global resources or resource
            types.

          o REGIONAL  the results include only regional resources or  resource
            types.

          The default value is ALL .

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o REGIONAL

          o GLOBAL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the resources that are available in a pending resource share

       The  following  list-pending-invitation-resources  example lists all of
       the resources that are in the resource share associated with the speci-
       fied invitation.

              --resource-share-invitation-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share-invitation/1e3477be-4a95-46b4-bbe0-c4001EXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       resources -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain the information about the resources
          included the specified resource share.

          (structure)
              Describes a resource associated with a resource share in RAM.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource.

              type -> (string)
                 The resource type.  This  takes  the  form  of:  service-code

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resoure  Name  (ARN)  of the resource share this
                 resource is associated with.

              resourceGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of  the  resource  group.  This
                 value is available only if the resource is part of a resource
                 group.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the resource.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the resource.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the resource was associated  with  the
                 resource share.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date an time when the association was last updated.

              resourceRegionScope -> (string)
                 Specifies the scope of visibility of this resource:

                 o REGIONAL   The  resource  can  be  accessed  only  by using
                   requests that target the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region  in
                   which the resource exists.

                 o GLOBAL   The  resource  can be accessed from any Amazon Web
                   Services Region.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
