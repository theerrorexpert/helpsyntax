LIST-PRINCIPALS()                                            LIST-PRINCIPALS()



NAME
       list-principals -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  principals  that you are sharing resources with or that are
       sharing resources with you.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-principals is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: principals

          that match the following:

          o
            **
            SELF **  resources that you are sharing

          o

          resource share with the specified Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) .

       --principals (list)
          Specifies  that  you  want  to  list information for only the listed
          principals.

          You can include the following values:

            name

          o An ARN of an IAM user, for example: iam::123456789012user/username

          NOTE:
              Not all resource types can be shared with IAM roles  and  users.
              For  more  information,  see Sharing with IAM roles and users in
              the Resource Access Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies that you want to  list  information  for  only  principals
          associated  with resource shares that include the specified resource
          type.

          For a list of valid values, query the  ListResourceTypes  operation.

       --resource-share-arns (list)
          Specifies  that  you  want  to  list information for only principals
          associated with the resource shares specified by a list  the  Amazon
          Resource Names (ARNs) .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list principals with access to a resource

       The following list-principals example displays a list of the principals
       that  can  access  resources of the specified type through any resource
       shares.

          aws ram list-principals \
              --resource-type ec2:Subnet

       Output:

          {
              "principals": [
                  {
                      "id": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-gx7EXAMPLE/ou-29c5-zEXAMPLE",
                      "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE",
                      "creationTime": 1565298209.737,
                      "lastUpdatedTime": 1565298211.019,
                      "external": false
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       principals -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain the details about the principals.

          (structure)
              Describes a principal for use with Resource Access Manager.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the principal.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of a resource share the princi-
                 pal is associated with.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time when the principal was associated with the
                 resource share.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association was last updated.

              external -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the principal belongs to the same organiza-
                 tion in Organizations as the Amazon Web Services account that
                 owns the resource share.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
