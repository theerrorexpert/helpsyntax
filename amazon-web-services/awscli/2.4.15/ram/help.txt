NAME
       ram -

DESCRIPTION
       This  is the Resource Access Manager API Reference . This documentation
       provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types
       in  RAM. RAM is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web
       Services resources across Amazon Web Services  accounts.  If  you  have
       multiple  Amazon  Web Services accounts, you can use RAM to share those
       resources with other accounts. If you use Organizations to manage  your
       accounts, then you share your resources with your organization or orga-
       nizational units (OUs). For supported  resource  types,  you  can  also
       share  resources  with  individual Identity and Access Management (IAM)
       roles an users.
