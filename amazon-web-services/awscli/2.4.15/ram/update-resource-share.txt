NAME
       update-resource-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies some of the properties of the specified resource share.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-resource-share
          --resource-share-arn <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--allow-external-principals | --no-allow-external-principals]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource share that
          you want to modify.

       --name (string)
          If specified, the new name that you want to attach to  the  resource
          share.

       --allow-external-principals | --no-allow-external-principals (boolean)
          Specifies  whether principals outside your organization in Organiza-
          tions can be associated with a resource share.

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that  you  provide  to
          ensure  the  idempotency  of the request. This lets you safely retry
          the request without accidentally performing  the  same  operation  a
          second  time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a resource share

       The  following  update-resource-share  example  changes  the  specified
       resource  share  to  allow  external  principals that are not in an AWS
       Organization.

          aws ram update-resource-share \
              --allow-external-principals \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShare": {
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE",
                  "name": "my-resource-share",
                  "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "allowExternalPrincipals": true,
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "creationTime": 1565295733.282,
                  "lastUpdatedTime": 1565303080.023
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceShare -> (structure)
          Information about the resource share.

          resourceShareArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource share

          name -> (string)
              The name of the resource share.

          owningAccountId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource
              share.

          allowExternalPrincipals -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether principals outside your organization in Orga-
              nizations can be associated with a resource share.

              The current status of the resource share.

              A message about the status of the resource share.

          tags -> (list)
              The tag key and value pairs attached to the resource share.

              (structure)
                 A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you  can
                 attach  to  your  resources  to  help organize and categorize
                 them.  You  can  also  use  them  to  help  you  secure  your
                 resources.  For  more  information, see Controlling access to
                 Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

                 For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web  Ser-
                 vices  resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
                 Guide .

                 key -> (string)
                     The key, or name, attached to the  tag.  Every  tag  must
                     have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                 value -> (string)
                     The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an
                     empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the resource share was created.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the resource share was last updated.

          featureSet -> (string)
              Indicates how the resource share was  created.  Possible  values
              include:

              o CREATED_FROM_POLICY  -  Indicates  that the resource share was
                created  from  an  Identity  and   Access   Management   (IAM)
                resource-based  permission  policy  attached  to the resource.
                This type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon  Web
                Services  account  that created it. You can't modify it in RAM
                unless you promote it. For more information,  see   PromoteRe-
                sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  -  The resource share is in the process
                of being promoted. For more information, see  PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o STANDARD  -  Indicates  that the resource share was created in
                RAM using the console or APIs. These resource shares are visi-
                ble  to  all principals you share the resource share with. You
                can modify these resource shares in RAM using the  console  or
                APIs.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
