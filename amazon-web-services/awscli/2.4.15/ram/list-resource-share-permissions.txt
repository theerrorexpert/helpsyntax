NAME
       list-resource-share-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the RAM permissions that are associated with a resource share.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-resource-share-permissions
          --resource-share-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource share for
          which you want to retrieve the associated permissions.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies that you want to receive the next page of  results.  Valid
          only  if  you received a NextToken response in the previous request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output  is  available.  Set  this
          parameter  to  the  value  provided by the previous call's NextToken
          response to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each
          page  of  the  response.  If  you  do not include this parameter, it
          defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional
          items  exist  beyond  the number you specify, the NextToken response
          element is returned with a value (not null). Include  the  specified
          value  as  the  NextToken  request parameter in the next call to the
          operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service
          might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
          results available. You should check NextToken after every  operation
          to ensure that you receive all of the results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  list  all  of  the  RAM managed permissions currently attached to a
       resource share

       The following list-resource-share-permissions example lists all of  the
       RAM  managed  permissions  that  are attached to the specified resource
       share.

          aws ram list-resource-share-permissions \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/27d09b4b-5e12-41d1-a4f2-19dedEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "permissions": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:ram::aws:permission/AWSRAMDefaultPermissionLicenseConfiguration",
                      "version": "1",
                      "resourceType": "license-manager:LicenseConfiguration",
                      "status": "ASSOCIATED",
                      "lastUpdatedTime": 1632342984.234
                  },
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:ram::aws:permission/AWSRAMPermissionGlueDatabaseReadWrite",
                      "version": "2",
                      "resourceType": "glue:Database",
                      "status": "ASSOCIATED",
                      "lastUpdatedTime": 1632512462.297
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       permissions -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe the  permissions  associated  with
          the resource share.

          (structure)
              Information  about  an  RAM permission that is associated with a
              resource share and any of its resources of a specified type.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN)  of  the  permission  you  want
                 information about.

              version -> (string)
                 The  version of the permission represented in this structure.

              defaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the version of the  permission  represented
                 in this structure is the default version for this permission.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of this permission.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to which this permission applies.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the permission.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was created.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was last updated.

              isResourceTypeDefault -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the version of the  permission  represented
                 in this structure is the default version for all resources of
                 this resource type.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
