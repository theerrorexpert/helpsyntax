LIST-RESOURCE-TYPES()                                    LIST-RESOURCE-TYPES()



NAME
       list-resource-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the resource types that can be shared by RAM.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-resource-types
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--resource-region-scope <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          Specifies  that  you want to receive the next page of results. Valid
          only if you received a NextToken response in the  previous  request.
          If  you  did,  it  indicates that more output is available. Set this
          parameter to the value provided by  the  previous  call's  NextToken
          response to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each
          page of the response. If you  do  not  include  this  parameter,  it
          defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional
          items exist beyond the number you specify,  the  NextToken  response
          element  is  returned with a value (not null). Include the specified
          value as the NextToken request parameter in the  next  call  to  the
          operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service
          might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
          results  available. You should check NextToken after every operation
          to ensure that you receive all of the results.

       --resource-region-scope (string)
          Specifies that you want the results to include only  resources  that
          have the specified scope.

          o ALL   the  results  include  both global and regional resources or
            resource types.

          o GLOBAL  the results include  only  global  resources  or  resource
            types.

          o REGIONAL   the results include only regional resources or resource
            types.

          The default value is ALL .

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o REGIONAL

          o GLOBAL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the resource types that are supported by AWS RAM

       The following list-resource-types example lists  all  of  the  resource
       types currently supported by AWS RAM.

          aws ram list-resource-types

       Output:

          {
              "resourceTypes": [
                  {
                      "resourceType": "route53resolver:FirewallRuleGroup",
                      "serviceName": "route53resolver"
                  },
                  {
                      "resourceType": "ec2:LocalGatewayRouteTable",
                      "serviceName": "ec2"
                  },
                  ...OUTPUT TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY...
                  {
                      "resourceType": "ec2:Subnet",
                      "serviceName": "ec2"
                  },
                  {
                      "resourceType": "ec2:TransitGatewayMulticastDomain",
                      "serviceName": "ec2"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceTypes -> (list)
          An  array  of  objects  that  contain information about the resource
          types that can be shared using RAM.

          (structure)
              Information about a shareable resource type and the  Amazon  Web
              Services service to which resources of that type belong.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource.

              serviceName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  Amazon  Web  Services  service  to  which
                 resources of this type belong.

              resourceRegionScope -> (string)
                 Specifies the scope of visibility of resources of this type:

                 o REGIONAL  The  resource  can  be  accessed  only  by  using
                   requests  that  target  the  Amazon  Web Services Region in
                   which the resource exists.

                 o GLOBAL  The resource can be accessed from  any  Amazon  Web
                   Services Region.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
