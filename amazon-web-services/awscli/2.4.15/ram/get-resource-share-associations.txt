GET-RESOURCE-SHARE-ASSOCIATIONS()            GET-RESOURCE-SHARE-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       get-resource-share-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  resource and principal associations for resource shares
       that you own.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-resource-share-associations is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: resourceShareAssociations

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-share-associations
          --association-type <value>
          [--resource-share-arns <value>]
          [--resource-arn <value>]
          [--principal <value>]
          [--association-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-type (string)
          Specifies whether you want to retrieve the associations that involve
          a specified resource or principal.

          o PRINCIPAL  list the principals that are associated with the speci-
            fied resource share.

          o RESOURCE   list  the resources that are associated with the speci-
            fied resource share.

          Possible values:

          o PRINCIPAL

          o RESOURCE

       --resource-share-arns (list)
          Specifies a list of Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)  of  the  resource
          share whose associations you want to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resoure  Name  (ARN)  of  the resource whose
          resource shares you want to retrieve.

          You cannot specify this parameter if the association type is PRINCI-
          PAL .

       --principal (string)
          Specifies  the ID of the principal whose resource shares you want to
          retrieve. This can be an Amazon Web Services account ID, an  organi-
          zation  ID,  an  organizational  unit ID, or the Amazon Resoure Name
          (ARN) of an individual IAM user or role.

          You cannot  specify  this  parameter  if  the  association  type  is
          RESOURCE .

       --association-status (string)
          Specifies that you want to retrieve only associations with this sta-
          tus.

          Possible values:

          o ASSOCIATING

          o ASSOCIATED

          o FAILED

          o DISASSOCIATING

          o DISASSOCIATED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The   following   get-resource-share-associations   example  lists  the
       resource associations  for  all  resource  types  across  all  of  your
       resource shares.

          aws ram get-resource-share-associations \
              --association-type RESOURCE

       Example 2: To list principal associations for a resource share

       The  following  get-resource-share-associations  example lists only the
       principal associations for only the specified resource share.

          aws ram get-resource-share-associations \
             --resource-share-arns arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7be8694e-095c-41ca-9ce8-7be4aEXAMPLE \
             --association-type PRINCIPAL

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShareAssociations": [
                  {
                      "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7be8694e-095c-41ca-9ce8-7be4aEXAMPLE",

                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceShareAssociations -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain the details about the associations.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  association  with  a  resource share and either a
              principal or a resource.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource share.

              resourceShareName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource share.

              associatedEntity -> (string)
                 The associated entity. This can be either of the following:

                 o For a resource association, this is the Amazon Resoure Name
                   (ARN) of the resource.

                 o For principal associations, this is one of the following:

                   o The ID of an Amazon Web Services account

                   o The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of an organization in Orga-
                     nizations

                   o The ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations

                   o The ARN of an IAM role

                   o The ARN of an IAM user

              associationType -> (string)
                 The type of entity included in this association.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the association.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the association.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association was created.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association was last updated.

              external -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the principal belongs to the same organiza-
                 tion in Organizations as the Amazon Web Services account that
                 owns the resource share.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
