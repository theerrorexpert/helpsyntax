GET-RESOURCE-SHARES()                                    GET-RESOURCE-SHARES()



NAME
       get-resource-shares -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  details  about  the resource shares that you own or that are
       shared with you.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-resource-shares is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: resourceShares

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arns (list)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) of individual resource
          shares that you want information about.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-share-status (string)
          Specifies that you want to retrieve details of only  those  resource
          shares that have this status.

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o ACTIVE

          o FAILED

          o DELETING

          o DELETED

       --resource-owner (string)
          Specifies  that  you want to retrieve details of only those resource
          shares that match the following:

          o
            **
            SELF **  resources that you are sharing

          o
            **
            OTHER-ACCOUNTS **  resources that other accounts share with you

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o OTHER-ACCOUNTS

       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of an individual resource share that you want  to
          retrieve details about.

       --tag-filters (list)
          Specifies  that  you want to retrieve details of only those resource
          shares that match the specified tag keys and values.

          (structure)
              A tag key and optional list of possible values that you can  use
              to filter results for tagged resources.

              tagKey -> (string)
                 The tag key. This must have a valid string value and can't be
                 empty.

              tagValues -> (list)
                 A list of zero or more tag values. If no values are provided,
                 then  the  filter  matches  any  tag  with the specified key,
                 regardless of its value.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagKey=string,tagValues=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "tagKey": "string",
              "tagValues": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --permission-arn (string)
          Specifies that you want to retrieve details of only  those  resource
          shares  that  use  the  RAM permission with this Amazon Resoure Name
          (ARN) .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To list resource shares owned by others and shared with you

       The following get-resource-shares example  lists  the  resource  shares
       that  others  created  and  shared with you. In this example, there are
       none.

          aws ram get-resource-shares \
              --resource-owner OTHER-ACCOUNTS

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShares": []
          }

              allowExternalPrincipals -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether principals  outside  your  organization  in
                 Organizations can be associated with a resource share.

                 (structure)
                     A  structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you
                     can attach to your resources to help organize and catego-
                     rize  them. You can also use them to help you secure your
                     resources. For more information, see  Controlling  access
                     to Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

                     For  more  information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web

                        have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                     value -> (string)
                        The string value attached to the tag. The value can be

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the resource share was last updated.

              featureSet -> (string)
                 Indicates how the resource share was created. Possible values
                 include:

                 o CREATED_FROM_POLICY - Indicates that the resource share was
                   created  from  an  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)
                   resource-based permission policy attached to the  resource.
                   This  type  of resource share is visible only to the Amazon
                   Web Services account that created it. You can't  modify  it
                   in  RAM  unless  you  promote it. For more information, see
                   PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

                 o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  -  The  resource  share  is  in  the
                   process  of being promoted. For more information, see  Pro-
                   moteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

                 o STANDARD - Indicates that the resource share was created in
                   RAM  using  the  console or APIs. These resource shares are
                   visible to all principals  you  share  the  resource  share
                   with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using the
                   console or APIs.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
