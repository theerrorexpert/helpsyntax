GET-RESOURCE-POLICIES()                                GET-RESOURCE-POLICIES()



NAME
       get-resource-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  resource  policies for the specified resources that you
       own and have shared.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-resource-policies is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: policies

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-policies
          --resource-arns <value>
          [--principal <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arns (list)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources whose
          policies you want to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --principal (string)
          Specifies the principal.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the policies for a resource

       The following get-resource-policies example displays the resource-based
       permission policies  for  the  specified  resource  associated  with  a
       resource share.

          aws ram get-resource-policies \
              --resource-arns arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:subnet/subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "policies": [
                   "{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"RamStatement1\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":[]},\"Action\":[\"ec2:RunInstances\",\"ec2:CreateNetworkInterface\",\"ec2:DescribeSubnets\"],\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:subnet/subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE\"}]}"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       policies -> (list)
          An array of resource policy documents in JSON format.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
