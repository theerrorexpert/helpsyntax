RB()                                                                      RB()



NAME
       rb -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an  empty  S3  bucket.  A  bucket  must be completely empty of
       objects and versioned objects before it can be  deleted.  However,  the
       --force  parameter  can  be used to delete the non-versioned objects in
       the bucket before the bucket is deleted.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            rb
          <S3Uri>
          [--force]

OPTIONS
       path (string)

       --force (boolean) Deletes all  objects  in  the  bucket  including  the
       bucket  itself. Note that versioned objects will not be deleted in this
       process which would cause the  bucket  deletion  to  fail  because  the
       bucket  would  not  be empty. To delete versioned objects use the s3api
       delete-object command with the --version-id parameter.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following rb command removes a bucket.  In this example, the user's
       bucket  is  mybucket.   Note  that the bucket must be empty in order to
       remove:

          aws s3 rb s3://mybucket

       Output:

          remove_bucket: mybucket

       The following rb command uses the --force parameter to first remove all
       of  the  objects  in  the bucket and then remove the bucket itself.  In
       this example, the user's bucket is mybucket and the objects in mybucket
       are test1.txt and test2.txt:

          aws s3 rb s3://mybucket --force

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test1.txt
          delete: s3://mybucket/test2.txt
          remove_bucket: mybucket



                                                                          RB()
