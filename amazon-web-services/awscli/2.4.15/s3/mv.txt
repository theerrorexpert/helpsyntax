OPTIONS
       paths (string)

       --dryrun  (boolean)  Displays  the  operations  that would be performed
       using the specified command without actually running them.

       --quiet (boolean) Does not display the operations  performed  from  the
       specified command.

       --include  (string)  Don't exclude files or objects in the command that
       match the specified pattern. See Use of Exclude and Include Filters for
       details.

       --exclude  (string)  Exclude all files or objects from the command that
       matches the specified pattern.

       --acl (string) Sets the ACL for the object when  the  command  is  per-
       formed.  If  you use this parameter you must have the "s3:PutObjectAcl"
       permission included in the list of actions for your  IAM  policy.  Only
       accepts  values  of  private, public-read, public-read-write, authenti-
       cated-read, aws-exec-read, bucket-owner-read, bucket-owner-full-control
       and log-delivery-write. See Canned ACL for details

       --follow-symlinks  |  --no-follow-symlinks (boolean) Symbolic links are
       followed only when uploading to S3 from the local filesystem. Note that
       S3  does not support symbolic links, so the contents of the link target
       are uploaded under the name of the link. When neither --follow-symlinks
       nor  --no-follow-symlinks  is  specified, the default is to follow sym-
       links.

       --no-guess-mime-type (boolean) Do not try to guess the  mime  type  for
       uploaded  files.  By default the mime type of a file is guessed when it
       is uploaded.

       --sse (string) Specifies server-side encryption of the  object  in  S3.
       Valid  values are AES256 and aws:kms. If the parameter is specified but
       no value is provided, AES256 is used.

       --sse-c (string) Specifies server-side encryption using  customer  pro-
       vided  keys of the the object in S3. AES256 is the only valid value. If
       the parameter is specified but no value is provided, AES256 is used. If
       you provide this value, --sse-c-key must be specified as well.

       --sse-c-key  (blob)  The  customer-provided  encryption  key  to use to
       server-side encrypt the object  in  S3.  If  you  provide  this  value,
       --sse-c  must  be  specified  as  well.  The key provided should not be
       base64 encoded.

       --sse-kms-key-id (string) The customer-managed AWS Key Management  Ser-
       vice (KMS) key ID that should be used to server-side encrypt the object
       in S3. You should only provide this parameter if you are using  a  cus-
       tomer  managed  customer  master  key (CMK) and not the AWS managed KMS
       CMK.

       --sse-c-copy-source (string) This parameter should  only  be  specified
       when  copying  an  S3 object that was encrypted server-side with a cus-
       tomer-provided key. It specifies the algorithm to use  when  decrypting
       the  source object. AES256 is the only valid value. If the parameter is
       specified but no value is provided, AES256 is used. If you provide this
       value, --sse-c-copy-source-key must be specified as well.

       --sse-c-copy-source-key  (blob) This parameter should only be specified
       when copying an S3 object that was encrypted server-side  with  a  cus-
       tomer-provided  key. Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for
       Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object. The encryption key  pro-
       vided  must be one that was used when the source object was created. If
       you provide this value, --sse-c-copy-source be specified as  well.  The
       key provided should not be base64 encoded.

       --storage-class  (string)  The  type  of storage to use for the object.
       Valid choices are: STANDARD | REDUCED_REDUNDANCY | STANDARD_IA  |  ONE-
       ZONE_IA  |  INTELLIGENT_TIERING  | GLACIER | DEEP_ARCHIVE | GLACIER_IR.
       Defaults to 'STANDARD'

       --grants (string)
          Grant specific permissions to individual users or  groups.  You  can
          supply a list of grants of the form

              --grants Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID [Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID ...]

          To  specify  the same permission type for multiple grantees, specify
          the permission as such as

              --grants Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID,Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID,...

          Each value contains the following elements:

          o Permission - Specifies the granted permissions, and can be set  to
            read, readacl, writeacl, or full.

          o Grantee_Type  - Specifies how the grantee is to be identified, and
            can be set to uri or id.

          o Grantee_ID - Specifies the  grantee  based  on  Grantee_Type.  The
            Grantee_ID value can be one of:

            o uri  -  The  group's  URI.  For  more  information, see Who Is a
              Grantee?

            o id - The account's canonical ID

          For more information on Amazon S3 access control, see Access Control

       --website-redirect  (string)  If the bucket is configured as a website,
       redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket
       or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the
       object metadata.

       --content-type (string) Specify an explicit content type for this oper-
       ation. This value overrides any guessed mime types.

       --cache-control   (string)   Specifies   caching   behavior  along  the
       request/reply chain.

       --content-disposition (string) Specifies presentational information for
       the object.

       --content-encoding  (string) Specifies what content encodings have been
       applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied
       to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       --content-language (string) The language the content is in.

       --expires  (string)  The date and time at which the object is no longer
       cacheable.

       --source-region (string) When transferring objects from an s3 bucket to
       an  s3 bucket, this specifies the region of the source bucket. Note the
       region specified by --region or through configuration of the CLI refers
       to  the  region  of  the  destination bucket. If --source-region is not
       specified the region of the source will be the same as  the  region  of
       the destination bucket.

       --only-show-errors  (boolean)  Only  errors and warnings are displayed.
       All other output is suppressed.

       --no-progress (boolean) File transfer progress is not  displayed.  This
       flag  is only applied when the quiet and only-show-errors flags are not
       provided.

       --page-size (integer) The number of results to return in each  response
       to  a  list operation. The default value is 1000 (the maximum allowed).
       Using a lower value may help if an operation times out.

       --ignore-glacier-warnings (boolean) Turns off glacier  warnings.  Warn-
       ings  about  an  operation that cannot be performed because it involves
       copying, downloading, or moving a glacier  object  will  no  longer  be
       printed  to  standard error and will no longer cause the return code of
       the command to be 2.

       --force-glacier-transfer (boolean) Forces a  transfer  request  on  all
       Glacier objects in a sync or recursive copy.

       --request-payer  (string)  Confirms  that the requester knows that they
       will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need  not  specify  this
       parameter  in their requests. Documentation on downloading objects from
       requester      pays      buckets      can       be       found       at
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html

       --metadata (map) A map of metadata to store with  the  objects  in  S3.
       This  will be applied to every object which is part of this request. In
       a sync, this means that files which haven't changed won't  receive  the
       new metadata. key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --copy-props  (string)  Determines which properties are copied from the
       source S3 object. This parameter only applies  for  S3  to  S3  copies.
       Valid values are:

          o none  -  Do  not  copy  any  of  the properties from the source S3
            object.

          o metadata-directive - Copies  the  following  properties  from  the
            source  S3  object: content-type, content-language, content-encod-
            ing, content-disposition, cache-control, --expires, and metadata

          o default - The default value. Copies tags  and  properties  covered
            under the metadata-directive value from the source S3 object.

          In  order  to  copy the appropriate properties for multipart copies,
          some of the options may require additional API calls if a  multipart
          copy is involved. Specifically:

          o metadata-directive may require additional HeadObject API calls.

          o default  may  require additional HeadObject, GetObjectTagging, and
            PutObjectTagging API calls. Note this list of API calls  may  grow
            in  the  future  in  order to ensure multipart copies preserve the
            exact properties a CopyObject API call would preserve.

          If you want to guarantee no additional API calls are made other than
          than  the ones needed to perform the actual copy, set this option to
          none.

       --metadata-directive (string) Sets the x-amz-metadata-directive  header
       for  CopyObject  operations.  It is recommended to use the --copy-props
       parameter instead to control copying of metadata properties. If --meta-
       data-directive  is set, the --copy-props parameter will be disabled and
       will have no affect on the transfer.

       --recursive (boolean) Command is performed  on  all  files  or  objects
       under the specified directory or prefix.

EXAMPLES
       The  following mv command moves a single file to a specified bucket and
       key:

          aws s3 mv test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Output:

          move: test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The following mv command moves a single s3 object to a specified bucket
       and key:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The  following  mv  command  moves  a single object to a specified file
       locally:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt test2.txt

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to test2.txt

       The following mv command moves a single object to  a  specified  bucket
       while retaining its original name:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket2/

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket2/test.txt

       When  passed  with  the parameter --recursive, the following mv command
       recursively moves all objects under a specified prefix and bucket to  a
       specified  directory.   In  this  example,  the bucket mybucket has the
       objects test1.txt and test2.txt:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket . --recursive

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to test1.txt
          move: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to test2.txt

       When passed with the parameter --recursive, the  following  mv  command
       recursively  moves all files under a specified directory to a specified
       bucket and prefix while excluding some  files  by  using  an  --exclude
       parameter. In this example, the directory myDir has the files test1.txt
       and test2.jpg:

          aws s3 mv myDir s3://mybucket/ --recursive --exclude "*.jpg"

       Output:

          move: myDir/test1.txt to s3://mybucket2/test1.txt

       When passed with the parameter --recursive, the  following  mv  command
       recursively  moves  all  objects  under  a  specified bucket to another
       bucket while excluding some objects by using  an  --exclude  parameter.
       In  this  example,  the  bucket  mybucket has the objects test1.txt and
       another/test1.txt:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/ s3://mybucket2/ --recursive --exclude "mybucket/another/*"

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to s3://mybucket2/test1.txt

       The following mv command moves a single object to  a  specified  bucket
       and key while setting the ACL to public-read-write:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt --acl public-read-write

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The  following mv command illustrates the use of the --grants option to
       grant read access to all users and full  control  to  a  specific  user
       identified by their email address:

          aws s3 mv file.txt s3://mybucket/ --grants read=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers full=emailaddress=user@example.com

       Output:

          move: file.txt to s3://mybucket/file.txt

       Moving a file to an S3 access point

       The  following mv command moves a single file (mydoc.txt) to the access
       point (myaccesspoint) at the key (mykey):

          aws s3 mv mydoc.txt s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey

       Output:

          move: mydoc.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey



                                                                          MV()
