PRESIGN()                                                            PRESIGN()



NAME
       presign -

DESCRIPTION
       Generate  a  pre-signed URL for an Amazon S3 object. This allows anyone
       who receives the pre-signed URL to retrieve the S3 object with an  HTTP
       GET  request.  All presigned URL's now use sigv4 so the region needs to
       be configured explicitly.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            presign
          <S3Uri>
          [--expires-in <value>]

OPTIONS
       path (string)

       --expires-in (integer) Number  of  seconds  until  the  pre-signed  URL
       expires. Default is 3600 seconds. Maximum is 604800 seconds.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  create  a  pre-signed  URL  with the default one hour lifetime that
       links to an object in an S3 bucket

       The following presign command generates a pre-signed URL for  a  speci-
       fied bucket and key that is valid for one hour:

          aws s3 presign s3://awsexamplebucket/test2.txt

       Output:

          https://awsexamplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test2.txt?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAEXAMPLEACCESSKEY&Signature=EXHCcBe%EXAMPLEKnz3r8O0AgEXAMPLE&Expires=1555531131

       To  create  a  pre-signed  URL  with a custom lifetime that links to an
       object in an S3 bucket

       The following presign command generates a pre-signed URL for  a  speci-
       fied bucket and key that is valid for one week:

          aws s3 presign s3://awsexamplebucket/test2.txt --expires-in 604800

       Output:

          https://examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test2.txt?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAEXAMPLEACCESSKEY&Signature=EXHCcBe%EXAMPLEKnz3r8O0AgEXAMPLE&Expires=1556132848
