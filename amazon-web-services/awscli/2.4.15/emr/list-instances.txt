LIST-INSTANCES()                                              LIST-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  for  all  active EC2 instances and EC2 instances
       terminated in the last 30 days, up to a maximum of 2,000. EC2 instances
       in any of the following states are considered active: AWAITING_FULFILL-
       MENT, PROVISIONING, BOOTSTRAPPING, RUNNING.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-instances is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Instances

SYNOPSIS
            list-instances
          --cluster-id <value>
          [--instance-group-id <value>]
          [--instance-group-types <value>]
          [--instance-fleet-id <value>]
          [--instance-fleet-type <value>]
          [--instance-states <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The identifier of the cluster for which to list the instances.

       --instance-group-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  instance  group  for  which  to  list  the
          instances.

       --instance-group-types (list)
          The type of instance group for which to list the instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            MASTER
            CORE
            TASK

       --instance-fleet-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the instance fleet.

       --instance-fleet-type (string)
          The node type of the instance fleet. For example  MASTER,  CORE,  or
          TASK.

          Possible values:

          o MASTER

          o CORE

          o TASK

       --instance-states (list)
          A  list  of  instance states that will filter the instances returned
          with this request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AWAITING_FULFILLMENT
            PROVISIONING
            BOOTSTRAPPING
            RUNNING
            TERMINATED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command lists all of the instances in a cluster with  the
       cluster ID j-3C6XNQ39VR9WL:

          aws emr list-instances --cluster-id j-3C6XNQ39VR9WL
