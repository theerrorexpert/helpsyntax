LIST-STUDIO-SESSION-MAPPINGS()                  LIST-STUDIO-SESSION-MAPPINGS()



NAME
       list-studio-session-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all user or group session mappings for the Amazon EMR
       Studio specified by StudioId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-studio-session-mappings is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: SessionMappings

SYNOPSIS
            list-studio-session-mappings
          [--studio-id <value>]
          [--identity-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --studio-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon EMR Studio.

       --identity-type (string)
          Specifies whether to return session mappings for users or groups. If
          not specified, the results include session mapping details for  both
          users and groups.

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o GROUP

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SessionMappings -> (list)
          A list of session mapping summary objects. Each object includes ses-
          sion mapping details such as creation time, identity type  (user  or
          group), and Amazon EMR Studio ID.

          (structure)
              Details for an Amazon EMR Studio session mapping. The details do
              not include the time the session mapping was last modified.

              StudioId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon EMR Studio.

              IdentityId -> (string)
                 The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the  user  or  group
                 from the Amazon Web Services SSO Identity Store.

              IdentityName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  user  or group. For more information, see
                 UserName and DisplayName in the Amazon Web Services SSO Iden-
                 tity Store API Reference .

              IdentityType -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether the identity mapped to the Amazon EMR Stu-
                 dio is a user or a group.

              SessionPolicyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the session policy  associ-
                 ated with the user or group.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the session mapping was created.

       Marker -> (string)
          The  pagination  token  that  indicates  the  next set of results to
          retrieve.
