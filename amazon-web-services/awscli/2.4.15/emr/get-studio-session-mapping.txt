NAME
       get-studio-session-mapping -

DESCRIPTION
       Fetches  mapping  details for the specified Amazon EMR Studio and iden-
       tity (user or group).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-studio-session-mapping
          --studio-id <value>
          [--identity-id <value>]
          [--identity-name <value>]
          --identity-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --studio-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon EMR Studio.

       --identity-id (string)
          The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the user or group. For more
          information,  see  UserId and GroupId in the Amazon Web Services SSO
          Identity Store API Reference .  Either  IdentityName  or  IdentityId
          must be specified.

       --identity-name (string)
          The  name  of  the user or group to fetch. For more information, see
          UserName and DisplayName in the Amazon  Web  Services  SSO  Identity
          Store  API  Reference  .  Either  IdentityName or IdentityId must be
          specified.

       --identity-type (string)
          Specifies whether the identity to fetch is a user or a group.

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o GROUP

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
