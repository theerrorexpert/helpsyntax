LIST-NOTEBOOK-EXECUTIONS()                          LIST-NOTEBOOK-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-notebook-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  summaries of all notebook executions. You can filter the list
       based on multiple criteria such as status, time range, and  editor  id.
       Returns  a  maximum of 50 notebook executions and a marker to track the
       paging of a longer notebook execution list  across  multiple  ListNote-
       bookExecution calls.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-notebook-executions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: NotebookExecutions

SYNOPSIS
            list-notebook-executions
          [--editor-id <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--from <value>]
          [--to <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --editor-id (string)
          The unique ID of the editor associated with the notebook  execution.

       --status (string)
          The status filter for listing notebook executions.

          o START_PENDING  indicates  that the cluster has received the execu-
            tion request but execution has not begun.

          o STARTING indicates that the execution is starting on the  cluster.

          o RUNNING  indicates  that  the  execution is being processed by the
            cluster.

          o FINISHING indicates that execution  processing  is  in  the  final
            stages.

          o FINISHED indicates that the execution has completed without error.

          o FAILING indicates that the execution is failing and will not  fin-
            ish successfully.

          o FAILED indicates that the execution failed.

          o STOP_PENDING  indicates  that the cluster has received a StopNote-
            bookExecution request and the stop is pending.

          o STOPPING indicates that the cluster is in the process of  stopping
            the execution as a result of a StopNotebookExecution request.

          o STOPPED  indicates  that  the execution stopped because of a Stop-
            NotebookExecution request.

          Possible values:

          o START_PENDING

          o STARTING

          o RUNNING

          o FINISHING

          o FINISHED

          o FAILING

          o FAILED

          o STOP_PENDING

          o STOPPING

          o STOPPED

       --from (timestamp)
          The beginning of time range filter for listing notebook  executions.
          The default is the timestamp of 30 days ago.

       --to (timestamp)
          The  end  of  time range filter for listing notebook executions. The
          default is the current timestamp.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
