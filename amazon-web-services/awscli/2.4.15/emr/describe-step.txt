DESCRIBE-STEP()                                                DESCRIBE-STEP()



NAME
       describe-step -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides more detail about the cluster step.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-step
          --cluster-id <value>
          --step-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The identifier of the cluster with steps to describe.

       --step-id (string)
          The identifier of the step to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following command describes a step with the step ID s-3LZC0QUT43AM
       in a cluster with the cluster ID j-3SD91U2E1L2QX:

          aws emr describe-step --cluster-id j-3SD91U2E1L2QX --step-id s-3LZC0QUT43AM

       Output:

OUTPUT
       Step -> (structure)
          The step details for the requested step identifier.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier of the cluster step.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the cluster step.

          Config -> (structure)
              The Hadoop job configuration of the cluster step.

              Jar -> (string)
                 The path to the JAR file that runs during the step.

              Properties -> (map)
                 The list of Java properties that are set when the step  runs.
                 You  can use these properties to pass key-value pairs to your
                 main function.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              MainClass -> (string)
                 The name of the main class in the specified Java file. If not
                 specified,  the  JAR  file should specify a main class in its
                 manifest file.

              Args -> (list)
                 The list of command line arguments to pass to the JAR  file's
                 main function for execution.

                 (string)

          ActionOnFailure -> (string)
              The  action to take when the cluster step fails. Possible values
              are TERMINATE_CLUSTER , CANCEL_AND_WAIT , and CONTINUE .  TERMI-
              NATE_JOB_FLOW  is provided for backward compatibility. We recom-
              mend using TERMINATE_CLUSTER instead.

              If a cluster's StepConcurrencyLevel is greater than 1 ,  do  not
              use  AddJobFlowSteps to submit a step with this parameter set to
              CANCEL_AND_WAIT or TERMINATE_CLUSTER . The step is not submitted
              and  the  action  fails  with a message that the ActionOnFailure
              setting is not valid.

              If you change a cluster's  StepConcurrencyLevel  to  be  greater
              than  1  while  a step is running, the ActionOnFailure parameter
              may not behave as you expect. In this  case,  for  a  step  that
              fails with this parameter set to CANCEL_AND_WAIT , pending steps
              and the running step are not canceled; for  a  step  that  fails
              with  this parameter set to TERMINATE_CLUSTER , the cluster does
              not terminate.

          Status -> (structure)
              The current execution status details of the cluster step.

              State -> (string)
                 The execution state of the cluster step.

              StateChangeReason -> (structure)
                 The reason for the step execution status change.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The programmable code for the state change reason.  Note:
                     Currently,  the  service  provides  no code for the state
                     change.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The descriptive message for the state change reason.

              FailureDetails -> (structure)
                 The details for the step failure including  reason,  message,
                 and log file path where the root cause was identified.

                 Reason -> (string)
                     The  reason  for  the step failure. In the case where the
                     service cannot successfully determine the root  cause  of
                     the failure, it returns "Unknown Error" as a reason.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The  descriptive  message  including the error the Amazon
                     EMR service has identified as the cause of step  failure.
                     This  is  text  from an error log that describes the root
                     cause of the failure.

                 LogFile -> (string)
                     The path to the log file  where  the  step  failure  root
                     cause was originally recorded.

              Timeline -> (structure)
                 The timeline of the cluster step status over time.

                 CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time when the cluster step was created.

                 StartDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and  time  when  the  cluster  step  execution
                     started.

                 EndDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time when the cluster  step  execution  com-
                     pleted or failed.
