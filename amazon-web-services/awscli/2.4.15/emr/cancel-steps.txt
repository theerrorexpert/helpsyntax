CANCEL-STEPS()                                                  CANCEL-STEPS()



NAME
       cancel-steps -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels a pending step or steps in a running cluster. Available only in
       Amazon EMR versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding version 5.0.0. A maximum
       of  256  steps  are allowed in each CancelSteps request. CancelSteps is
       idempotent but asynchronous; it does not guarantee that a step will  be
       canceled,  even  if the request is successfully submitted. When you use
       Amazon EMR versions 5.28.0 and later, you can cancel steps that are  in
       a  PENDING or RUNNING state. In earlier versions of Amazon EMR, you can
       only cancel steps that are in a PENDING state.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-steps
          --cluster-id <value>
          --step-ids <value>
          [--step-cancellation-option <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The ClusterID for the specified steps that  will  be  canceled.  Use
          RunJobFlow and  ListClusters to get ClusterIDs.

       --step-ids (list)
          The list of StepIDs to cancel. Use  ListSteps to get steps and their
          states for the specified cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --step-cancellation-option (string)
          The option to choose to cancel RUNNING steps. By default, the  value
          is SEND_INTERRUPT .

          Possible values:

          o SEND_INTERRUPT

          o TERMINATE_PROCESS

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CancelStepsInfoList -> (list)
          A  list  of   CancelStepsInfo  , which shows the status of specified
          cancel requests for each StepID specified.

          (structure)
              Specification of the status of a CancelSteps request.  Available
              only  in  Amazon  EMR version 4.8.0 and later, excluding version
              5.0.0.

              StepId -> (string)
                 The encrypted StepId of a step.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of a CancelSteps Request. The value may be SUBMIT-
                 TED or FAILED.

              Reason -> (string)
                 The  reason for the failure if the CancelSteps request fails.
