LIST-CLUSTERS()                                                LIST-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       list-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides the status of all clusters visible to this Amazon Web Services
       account. Allows you to filter the list of  clusters  based  on  certain
       criteria;  for  example, filtering by cluster creation date and time or
       by status. This call returns a maximum of 50 clusters in unsorted order
       per  call, but returns a marker to track the paging of the cluster list
       across multiple ListClusters calls.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-clusters is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Clusters

SYNOPSIS
            list-clusters
          [--created-after <value>]
          [--created-before <value>]
          [--cluster-states <value>]
          [--active | --terminated | --failed]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --created-after (timestamp)
          List  only  those clusters created after the date and time specified
          in the  format  yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.  For  example,  --created-after
          2017-07-04T00:01:30.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          List  only those clusters created before the date and time specified
          in the format  yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.  For  example,  --created-before
          2017-07-04T00:01:30.

       --cluster-states (string)
          Specifies  that  only  clusters  in the states specified are listed.
          Alternatively, you can use the shorthand form for single states or a
          group of states.

          Takes the following state values:

          o STARTING

          o BOOTSTRAPPING

          o RUNNING

          o WAITING

          o TERMINATING

          o TERMINATED

          o TERMINATED_WITH_ERRORS

       --active | --terminated | --failed (boolean)
          Shortcut   options  for  --cluster-states.  The  following  shortcut
          options can be specified:

          o --active - list only clusters that are STARTING ,``BOOTSTRAPPING``
            , RUNNING , WAITING , or TERMINATING .

          o --terminated - list only clusters that are TERMINATED .

          o --failed - list only clusters that are TERMINATED_WITH_ERRORS .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  lists  all  active EMR clusters in the current
       region:

          aws emr list-clusters --active

       Output:

          {
              "Clusters": [
                  {

              ]
          }

          (structure)
              The summary description of the cluster.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the cluster.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the cluster.

              Status -> (structure)
                 The details about the current status of the cluster.

                 State -> (string)
                     The current state of the cluster.

                 StateChangeReason -> (structure)
                     The reason for the cluster status change.

                     Code -> (string)
                        The programmatic code for the state change reason.

                     Message -> (string)
                        The descriptive message for the state change reason.

                 Timeline -> (structure)
                     A timeline that represents the status of a  cluster  over
                     the lifetime of the cluster.

                     CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The creation date and time of the cluster.

                     ReadyDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  date  and  time when the cluster was ready to run
                        steps.

                     EndDateTime -> (timestamp)

              NormalizedInstanceHours -> (integer)
                 An approximation of the cost of the cluster,  represented  in
                 m1.small/hours.  This value is incremented one time for every
                 hour an m1.small instance runs. Larger instances are weighted
                 more,  so  an  EC2  instance  that is roughly four times more
                 expensive would result in the normalized instance hours being
                 incremented by four. This result is only an approximation and
                 does not reflect the actual billing rate.

              ClusterArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name of the cluster.

              OutpostArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost where the clus-
                 ter is launched.

       Marker -> (string)
          The  pagination  token  that  indicates  the  next set of results to
          retrieve.
