OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A descriptive name for the Amazon EMR Studio.

       --description (string)
          A detailed description of the Amazon EMR Studio.

       --auth-mode (string)
          Specifies whether the Studio authenticates users using IAM or Amazon
          Web Services SSO.

          Possible values:

          o SSO

          o IAM

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to associate
          with the Studio.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          A list of subnet IDs to associate with the Amazon EMR Studio. A Stu-
          dio can have a maximum of 5 subnets. The subnets must belong to  the
          VPC  specified by VpcId . Studio users can create a Workspace in any
          of the specified subnets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --service-role (string)
          The IAM role that the Amazon EMR Studio assumes.  The  service  role
          provides a way for Amazon EMR Studio to interoperate with other Ama-
          zon Web Services services.

       --user-role (string)
          The IAM user role that users and groups assume when logged in to  an
          Amazon  EMR  Studio. Only specify a UserRole when you use Amazon Web
          Services SSO authentication. The permissions attached to  the  User-
          Role  can  be scoped down for each user or group using session poli-
          cies.

       --workspace-security-group-id (string)
          The ID of the  Amazon  EMR  Studio  Workspace  security  group.  The
          Workspace   security   group  allows  outbound  network  traffic  to
          resources in the Engine security group, and it must be in  the  same
          VPC specified by VpcId .

       --engine-security-group-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon EMR Studio Engine security group. The Engine
          security group allows inbound network  traffic  from  the  Workspace
          security  group, and it must be in the same VPC specified by VpcId .

       --default-s3-location (string)
          The Amazon S3 location to back up Amazon EMR Studio  Workspaces  and
          notebook files.

       --idp-auth-url (string)
          The authentication endpoint of your identity provider (IdP). Specify
          this value when you use IAM authentication and want to let federated
          users  log  in  to a Studio with the Studio URL and credentials from
          your IdP. Amazon EMR Studio redirects  users  to  this  endpoint  to
          enter credentials.

       --idp-relay-state-parameter-name (string)
          The  name  that your identity provider (IdP) uses for its RelayState
          parameter. For example, RelayState or TargetSource  .  Specify  this
          value  when  you  use  IAM  authentication and want to let federated
          users log in to a Studio using the Studio URL. The RelayState param-
          eter differs by IdP.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags  to associate with the Amazon EMR Studio. Tags are
          user-defined key-value pairs that consist of a required  key  string
          with  a maximum of 128 characters, and an optional value string with
          a maximum of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair containing user-defined metadata that  you  can
              associate  with  an  Amazon EMR resource. Tags make it easier to
              associate clusters in various ways, such as grouping clusters to
              track your Amazon EMR resource allocation costs. For more infor-
              mation, see Tag Clusters .

              Key -> (string)
                 A user-defined key, which is the minimum required information
                 for a valid tag. For more information, see Tag .

              Value -> (string)
                 A  user-defined  value,  which is optional in a tag. For more
                 information, see Tag Clusters .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StudioId -> (string)
          The ID of the Amazon EMR Studio.

       Url -> (string)
          The unique Studio access URL.
