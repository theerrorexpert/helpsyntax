NAME
       modify-instance-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       ModifyInstanceGroups  modifies  the  number  of nodes and configuration
       settings of an instance group. The input  parameters  include  the  new
       target instance count for the group and the instance group ID. The call
       will either succeed or fail atomically.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-instance-groups
          [--cluster-id <value>]
          [--instance-groups <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The ID of the cluster to which the instance group belongs.

       --instance-groups (list)
          Instance groups to change.

          (structure)
              Modify the size or configurations of an instance group.

              InstanceGroupId -> (string)

              InstanceCount -> (integer)
                 Target size for the instance group.

              EC2InstanceIdsToTerminate -> (list)
                 The EC2 InstanceIds to terminate.  After  you  terminate  the
                 instances, the instance group will not return to its original

                 DecommissionTimeout -> (integer)
                     The desired  timeout  for  decommissioning  an  instance.
                     Overrides the default YARN decommissioning timeout.

                 InstanceResizePolicy -> (structure)
                     Custom  policy  for  requesting termination protection or
                     termination  of  specific  instances  when  shrinking  an
                     instance group.

                     InstancesToTerminate -> (list)
                        Specific  list  of  instances  to  be  terminated when
                        shrinking an instance group.

                        (string)

                     InstancesToProtect -> (list)
                        Specific  list  of  instances  to  be  protected  when
                        shrinking an instance group.

                        (string)

                     InstanceTerminationTimeout -> (integer)
                        Decommissioning timeout override for the specific list
                        of instances to be terminated.

              Configurations -> (list)
                 A list of new or modified  configurations  to  apply  for  an
                 instance group.

                     An  optional  configuration specification to be used when
                     provisioning cluster instances, which can include config-
                     urations  for applications and software bundled with Ama-
                     zon EMR. A configuration consists  of  a  classification,
                     properties, and optional nested configurations. A classi-
                     fication refers to an application-specific  configuration
                     file.  Properties  are the settings you want to change in
                     that file. For more information, see Configuring Applica-

                        A  list of additional configurations to apply within a
                        configuration object.

                               A set of properties specified within a configu-
                               ration classification.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
