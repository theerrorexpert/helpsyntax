LIST-SECURITY-CONFIGURATIONS()                  LIST-SECURITY-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       list-security-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all the security configurations visible to this account, provid-
       ing their creation dates and times, and their names. This call  returns
       a  maximum  of  50 clusters per call, but returns a marker to track the
       paging of the cluster list across  multiple  ListSecurityConfigurations
       calls.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-security-configurations  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: SecurityConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            list-security-configurations
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list security configurations in the current region

       Command:

          aws emr list-security-configurations

       Output:

          {
              "SecurityConfigurations": [
                  {
                      "CreationDateTime": 1473889697.417,
                      "Name": "MySecurityConfig-1"
                  },
                  {
                      "CreationDateTime": 1473889697.417,
                      "Name": "MySecurityConfig-2"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       SecurityConfigurations -> (list)
          The creation date and time, and name, of  each  security  configura-
          tion.

          (structure)
              The  creation  date and time, and name, of a security configura-
              tion.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the security configuration.

              CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the security configuration was created.

       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token  that  indicates  the  next  set  of  results  to
          retrieve.  Include  the marker in the next ListSecurityConfiguration
          call to retrieve the next page of results, if required.
