NAME
       describe-notebook-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides details of a notebook execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-notebook-execution
          --notebook-execution-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --notebook-execution-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the notebook execution.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NotebookExecution -> (structure)
          Properties of the notebook execution.

          NotebookExecutionId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of a notebook execution.

          EditorId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier of the EMR Notebook that is used for the
              notebook execution.

          ExecutionEngine -> (structure)
              The execution engine, such as an EMR cluster, used  to  run  the
              EMR notebook and perform the notebook execution.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  of  the execution engine. For an EMR
                 cluster, this is the cluster ID.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of execution engine. A value of EMR specifies an EMR
                 cluster.

              MasterInstanceSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 An  optional  unique ID of an EC2 security group to associate
                 with the master instance of the EMR cluster for this notebook
                 execution.  For  more information see Specifying EC2 Security
                 Groups for EMR Notebooks in the EMR Management Guide .

          NotebookExecutionName -> (string)
              A name for the notebook execution.

          NotebookParams -> (string)
              Input parameters in JSON format passed to the  EMR  Notebook  at
              runtime for execution.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the notebook execution.

              o START_PENDING indicates that the cluster has received the exe-
                cution request but execution has not begun.

              o STARTING indicates that the execution is starting on the clus-
                ter.

              o RUNNING indicates that the execution is being processed by the
                cluster.

              o FINISHING indicates that execution processing is in the  final
                stages.

              o FINISHED  indicates  that  the execution has completed without
                error.

              o FAILING indicates that the execution is failing and  will  not
                finish successfully.

              o FAILED indicates that the execution failed.

              o STOP_PENDING  indicates  that the cluster has received a Stop-
                NotebookExecution request and the stop is pending.

              o STOPPING indicates that the cluster is in the process of stop-
                ping  the  execution  as  a  result of a StopNotebookExecution
                request.

              o STOPPED indicates that the  execution  stopped  because  of  a
                StopNotebookExecution request.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp when notebook execution started.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp when notebook execution ended.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notebook execution.

          OutputNotebookURI -> (string)
              The  location  of the notebook execution's output file in Amazon
              S3.

          LastStateChangeReason -> (string)
              The reason for the latest status change of the  notebook  execu-
              tion.

          NotebookInstanceSecurityGroupId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier of the EC2 security group associated with
              the EMR Notebook instance. For more information  see  Specifying
              EC2  Security  Groups  for  EMR  Notebooks in the EMR Management
              Guide .

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of tags associated with a notebook  execution.  Tags  are
              user-defined  key-value  pairs  that  consist  of a required key
              string with a maximum of 128 characters and  an  optional  value
              string with a maximum of 256 characters.

              (structure)
                 A  key-value  pair  containing user-defined metadata that you
                 can associate with an Amazon EMR resource. Tags make it  eas-
                 ier  to  associate clusters in various ways, such as grouping
                 clusters to track your Amazon EMR resource allocation  costs.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  user-defined key, which is the minimum required infor-
                     mation for a valid tag. For more information, see Tag .

                 Value -> (string)
                     A user-defined value, which is optional  in  a  tag.  For
