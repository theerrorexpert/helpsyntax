TERMINATE-CLUSTERS()                                      TERMINATE-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       terminate-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Shuts down one or more clusters, each specified by cluster ID. Use this
       command only on  clusters  that  do  not  have  termination  protection
       enabled.  Clusters  with  termination protection enabled are not termi-
       nated. When a cluster is shut down, any step not yet completed is  can-
       celed  and  the Amazon EC2 instances in the cluster are terminated. Any
       log files not already saved are uploaded to Amazon S3  if  a  --log-uri
       was specified when the cluster was created. The maximum number of clus-
       ters allowed in the list is 10. The command is asynchronous.  Depending
       on  the  configuration of the cluster, it may take from 5 to 20 minutes
       for the cluster to terminate completely and release allocated resources
       such as Amazon EC2 instances.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
