NAME
       describe-studio -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns details for the specified Amazon EMR Studio including ID, Name,
       VPC, Studio access URL, and so on.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-studio
          --studio-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --studio-id (string)
          The Amazon EMR Studio ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              IAM authentication.

          WorkspaceSecurityGroupId -> (string)
              The ID of the Workspace security group associated with the  Ama-
              zon  EMR  Studio.  The  Workspace security group allows outbound
              network traffic to resources in the Engine security group and to

          EngineSecurityGroupId -> (string)
              The  ID  of the Engine security group associated with the Amazon

              and notebook files.

          IdpAuthUrl -> (string)
              Your identity provider's  authentication  endpoint.  Amazon  EMR
              Studio  redirects federated users to this endpoint for authenti-
              cation when logging in to a Studio with the Studio URL.

                 A key-value pair containing user-defined  metadata  that  you
                 can  associate with an Amazon EMR resource. Tags make it eas-
                 ier to associate clusters in various ways, such  as  grouping
                 clusters  to track your Amazon EMR resource allocation costs.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A user-defined key, which is the minimum required  infor-
