DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or updates an Amazon EMR block public access configuration for
       your Amazon Web Services account in the current Region. For more infor-
       mation  see  Configure Block Public Access for Amazon EMR in the Amazon
       EMR Management Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-block-public-access-configuration
          --block-public-access-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --block-public-access-configuration (structure)
          A configuration for Amazon EMR block public access.  The  configura-
          tion applies to all clusters created in your account for the current
          Region. The configuration specifies whether block public  access  is
          enabled.  If block public access is enabled, security groups associ-
          ated with the cluster cannot have rules that allow  inbound  traffic
          from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 on a port, unless the port is specified as an
          exception using PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges in the Block-
          PublicAccessConfiguration  .  By default, Port 22 (SSH) is an excep-
          tion, and public access is allowed on this port. You can change this
          by updating BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules to remove the exception.

          NOTE:
              For  accounts  that created clusters in a Region before November
              25, 2019, block public access is disabled  by  default  in  that
              Region.  To  use this feature, you must manually enable and con-
              figure it. For accounts that did not create an EMR cluster in  a
              Region  before  this  date,  block  public  access is enabled by
              default in that Region.

          BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether Amazon EMR  block  public  access  is  enabled
              (true ) or disabled (false ). By default, the value is false for
              accounts that have created EMR clusters before  July  2019.  For
              accounts created after this, the default is true .

          PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges -> (list)
              Specifies ports and port ranges that are permitted to have secu-
              rity group rules that allow  inbound  traffic  from  all  public
              sources.  For example, if Port 23 (Telnet) is specified for Per-
              mittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges , Amazon EMR allows  cluster
              creation  if  a security group associated with the cluster has a
              rule that allows inbound traffic on Port 23 from IPv4  0.0.0.0/0
              or IPv6 port ::/0 as the source.

              By default, Port 22, which is used for SSH access to the cluster
              EC2  instances,  is  in  the  list  of  PermittedPublicSecurity-
              GroupRuleRanges .

              (structure)
                 A  list  of  port  ranges that are permitted to allow inbound
                 traffic from all public IP addresses.  To  specify  a  single
                 port, use the same value for MinRange and MaxRange .

                 MinRange -> (integer)
                     The  smallest  port  number  in a specified range of port
                     numbers.

                 MaxRange -> (integer)
                     The smallest port number in a  specified  range  of  port
                     numbers.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules=boolean,PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges=[{MinRange=integer,MaxRange=integer},{MinRange=integer,MaxRange=integer}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules": true|false,
            "PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges": [
              {
                "MinRange": integer,
                "MaxRange": integer
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
