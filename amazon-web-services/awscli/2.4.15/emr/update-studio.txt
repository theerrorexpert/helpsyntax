       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-studio
          --studio-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--subnet-ids <value>]
          [--default-s3-location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --studio-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon EMR Studio to update.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive name for the Amazon EMR Studio.

       --description (string)
          A detailed description to assign to the Amazon EMR Studio.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          A list of subnet IDs to associate with the Amazon  EMR  Studio.  The
          list  can  include  new subnet IDs, but must also include all of the
          subnet IDs previously associated with the  Studio.  The  list  order
          does  not matter. A Studio can have a maximum of 5 subnets. The sub-
          nets must belong to the same VPC as the Studio.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --default-s3-location (string)
          The Amazon S3 location to back up Workspaces and notebook files  for
          the Amazon EMR Studio.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
