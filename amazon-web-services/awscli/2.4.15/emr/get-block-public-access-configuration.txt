NAME
       get-block-public-access-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the Amazon EMR block public access configuration for your Ama-
       zon Web Services account in the current Region.  For  more  information
       see Configure Block Public Access for Amazon EMR in the Amazon EMR Man-
       agement Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-block-public-access-configuration
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BlockPublicAccessConfiguration -> (structure)
          A configuration for Amazon EMR block public access.  The  configura-
          tion applies to all clusters created in your account for the current
          Region. The configuration specifies whether block public  access  is
          enabled.  If block public access is enabled, security groups associ-
          ated with the cluster cannot have rules that allow  inbound  traffic
          from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 on a port, unless the port is specified as an
          exception using PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges in the Block-
          PublicAccessConfiguration  .  By default, Port 22 (SSH) is an excep-
          tion, and public access is allowed on this port. You can change this
          by  updating  the  block  public  access configuration to remove the
          exception.

          NOTE:
              For accounts that created clusters in a Region  before  November
              25,  2019,  block  public  access is disabled by default in that
              Region. To use this feature, you must manually enable  and  con-
              figure  it. For accounts that did not create an EMR cluster in a
              Region before this date,  block  public  access  is  enabled  by
              default in that Region.

          BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  Amazon  EMR  block  public access is enabled
              (true ) or disabled (false ). By default, the value is false for
              accounts  that  have  created EMR clusters before July 2019. For
              accounts created after this, the default is true .

          PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges -> (list)
              Specifies ports and port ranges that are permitted to have secu-
              rity  group  rules  that  allow  inbound traffic from all public
              sources. For example, if Port 23 (Telnet) is specified for  Per-
              mittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges  , Amazon EMR allows cluster
              creation if a security group associated with the cluster  has  a
              rule  that allows inbound traffic on Port 23 from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0
              or IPv6 port ::/0 as the source.

              By default, Port 22, which is used for SSH access to the cluster
              EC2  instances,  is  in  the  list  of  PermittedPublicSecurity-
              GroupRuleRanges .

              (structure)
                 A list of port ranges that are  permitted  to  allow  inbound
                 traffic  from  all  public  IP addresses. To specify a single
                 port, use the same value for MinRange and MaxRange .

                 MinRange -> (integer)
                     The smallest port number in a  specified  range  of  port
                     numbers.

                 MaxRange -> (integer)
                     The  smallest  port  number  in a specified range of port
                     numbers.

       BlockPublicAccessConfigurationMetadata -> (structure)
          Properties that describe the Amazon Web Services principal that cre-
          ated  the BlockPublicAccessConfiguration using the PutBlockPublicAc-
          cessConfiguration action as well as the date and time that the  con-
          figuration  was  created. Each time a configuration for block public
          access is updated, Amazon EMR updates this metadata.

          CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the configuration was created.

          CreatedByArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name that created or last modified the  con-
              figuration.
