NAME
       describe-smb-file-shares -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  description  for  one  or more Server Message Block (SMB) file
       shares from a S3 File Gateway. This operation is only supported for  S3
       File Gateways.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-smb-file-shares
          --file-share-arn-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-share-arn-list (list)
          An  array  containing  the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of each file
          share to be described.

          (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SMBFileShareInfoList -> (list)
          An array containing a description for each requested file share.

          (structure)
              The Windows file permissions and ownership information assigned,
              by  default, to native S3 objects when S3 File Gateway discovers
              them in S3 buckets. This operation is only supported for S3 File
              Gateways.

              FileShareARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share.

              FileShareId -> (string)
                 The ID of the file share.

              FileShareStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the file share.

                 Valid Values: CREATING | UPDATING | AVAILABLE | DELETING

              GatewayARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  List-
                 Gateways operation to return a  list  of  gateways  for  your
                 account and Amazon Web Services Region.

              KMSEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 Set to true to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your
                 own KMS key, or false to use a  key  managed  by  Amazon  S3.
                 Optional.

                 Valid Values: true | false

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master
                 key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption.  Storage
                 Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only
                 be set when KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

              Path -> (string)
                 The file share path used by the SMB client  to  identify  the
                 mount point.

              Role -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the IAM role that an S3 File Gateway assumes when
                 it accesses the underlying storage.

              LocationARN -> (string)
                 A custom ARN for the backend storage used  for  storing  data
                 for  file shares. It includes a resource ARN with an optional
                 prefix concatenation. The prefix  must  end  with  a  forward
                 slash (/).

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify LocationARN as a bucket ARN, access point
                     ARN or access point alias,  as  shown  in  the  following
                     examples.

                     Bucket ARN:
                        arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/prefix/

                     Access point ARN:
                        arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:access-
                        point/access-point-name/prefix/

                     If you specify an access point, the bucket policy must be
                     configured  to  delegate  access  control  to  the access
                     point. For information, see Delegating access control  to
                     access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     Access point alias:
                        test-ap-ab123cdef4gehijklmn5opqrstuvuse1a-s3alias

              DefaultStorageClass -> (string)
                 The  default  storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3
                 bucket by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_INTEL-
                 LIGENT_TIERING . Optional.

                 Valid Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STAN-
                 DARD_IA | S3_ONEZONE_IA

              ObjectACL -> (string)
                 A value that sets the access control  list  (ACL)  permission
                 for  objects  in  the  S3 bucket that an S3 File Gateway puts
                 objects into. The default value is private .

              ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                 A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set  this
                 value to true to set the write status to read-only, otherwise
                 set to false .

                 Valid Values: true | false

              GuessMIMETypeEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A value that enables guessing of the MIME type  for  uploaded
                 objects  based  on file extensions. Set this value to true to
                 enable MIME type guessing,  otherwise  set  to  false  .  The
                 default value is true .

                 Valid Values: true | false

              RequesterPays -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that  sets who pays the cost of the request and the
                 cost associated with data download from  the  S3  bucket.  If
                 this  value  is  set  to true , the requester pays the costs;
                 otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the  S3  bucket
                 owner always pays the cost of storing data.

                 NOTE:
                     RequesterPays  is  a configuration for the S3 bucket that
                     backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration
                     on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configura-
                     tion.

                 Valid Values: true | false

              SMBACLEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If this value is set to true , it indicates that access  con-
                 trol  list  (ACL)  is enabled on the SMB file share. If it is
                 set to false , it indicates that file and  directory  permis-
                 sions are mapped to the POSIX permission.

                 For  more  information,  see  Using Microsoft Windows ACLs to
                 control access to an SMB file share in  the  Storage  Gateway
                 User Guide .

              AccessBasedEnumeration -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether AccessBasedEnumeration is enabled.

              AdminUserList -> (list)
                 A  list  of users or groups in the Active Directory that have
                 administrator rights to the file share. A group must be  pre-
                 fixed  with  the  @  character.  Acceptable  formats include:
                 DOMAIN\User1 , user1 , @group1 ,  and  @DOMAIN\group1  .  Can
                 only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory .

                 (string)

              ValidUserList -> (list)
                 A  list  of  users or groups in the Active Directory that are
                 allowed to access the file share. A group  must  be  prefixed
                 with   the   @   character.   Acceptable   formats   include:
                 DOMAIN\User1 , user1 , @group1 ,  and  @DOMAIN\group1  .  Can
                 only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory .

              InvalidUserList -> (list)
                 A  list  of  users or groups in the Active Directory that are
                 not allowed to access the file share. A group  must  be  pre-
                 fixed  with  the  @  character.  Acceptable  formats include:
                 DOMAIN\User1 , user1 , @group1 ,  and  @DOMAIN\group1  .  Can
                 only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory .

              AuditDestinationARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit
                 logs.

              Authentication -> (string)
                 The authentication method of the file share. The  default  is

                 Valid Values: ActiveDirectory | GuestAccess

              CaseSensitivity -> (string)
                 The  case  of  an  object  name  in  an Amazon S3 bucket. For
                 ClientSpecified , the client determines the case sensitivity.
                 For CaseSensitive , the gateway determines the case sensitiv-
                 ity. The default value is ClientSpecified .

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of up to 50 tags  assigned  to  the  SMB  file  share,
                 sorted  alphabetically  by  key name. Each tag is a key-value
                 pair. For a gateway with more than 10 tags assigned, you  can
                 view all tags using the ListTagsForResource API operation.

                 (structure)
                     A  key-value  pair  that  helps  you  manage, filter, and
                     search for your resource.  Allowed  characters:  letters,
                     white space, and numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the
                     following characters: + - = . _ : /.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

                     Value -> (string)
                        Value of the tag key.

              FileShareName -> (string)
                 The name of the file share. Optional.

                 NOTE:
                     FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set  in
                     LocationARN , or if an access point or access point alias
                     is used.

              CacheAttributes -> (structure)
                 Refresh cache information for the file share.

                 CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Refreshes a file share's cache  by  using  Time  To  Live
                     (TTL).  TTL  is the length of time since the last refresh
                     after which access to the directory would cause the  file
                     gateway  to  first refresh that directory's contents from
                     the Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon FSx file system.  The  TTL
                     duration is in seconds.

                     Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30
                     days)

              NotificationPolicy -> (string)
                 The notification policy of the file share. SettlingTimeInSec-
                 onds  controls  the  number of seconds to wait after the last
                 point in time a client wrote to a file before  generating  an
                 ObjectUploaded  notification.  Because  clients can make many
                 small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as
                 long  as  possible to avoid generating multiple notifications
                 for the same file in a small time period.

                 NOTE:
                     SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of  the
                     object  uploading  to  Amazon  S3, only the timing of the
                     notification.

                 The following example sets NotificationPolicy  on  with  Set-
                 tlingTimeInSeconds set to 60.
                     {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}

                 The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.
                     {}

              VPCEndpointDNSName -> (string)
                 Specifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the SMB file
                 share uses to connect to Amazon S3.

                 NOTE:
                     This parameter is required for SMB file shares that  con-
                     nect  to  Amazon  S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access
                     point, or an access point alias  that  points  to  a  VPC
                     access point.

              BucketRegion -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  Region  of  the  S3 bucket where the SMB file
                 share stores files.

                 NOTE:
                     This parameter is required for SMB file shares that  con-
                     nect  to  Amazon  S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access
                     point, or an access point alias  that  points  to  a  VPC
                     access point.

              OplocksEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  opportunistic  locking is enabled for the
                 SMB file share.

                 NOTE:
                     Enabling opportunistic locking on  case-sensitive  shares
                     is  not  recommended for workloads that involve access to
                     files with the same name in different case.

                 Valid Values: true | false
