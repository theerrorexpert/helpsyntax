RETRIEVE-TAPE-ARCHIVE()                                RETRIEVE-TAPE-ARCHIVE()



NAME
       retrieve-tape-archive -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves an archived virtual tape from the virtual tape shelf (VTS) to
       a tape gateway. Virtual tapes archived in the VTS  are  not  associated
       with  any  gateway. However after a tape is retrieved, it is associated
       with a gateway, even though it is also listed in the VTS, that is,  ar-
       chive. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.

       Once  a  tape  is  successfully  retrieved  to  a gateway, it cannot be
       retrieved again to another gateway. You must  archive  the  tape  again
       before  you  can retrieve it to another gateway. This operation is only
       supported in the tape gateway type.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            retrieve-tape-archive
          --tape-arn <value>
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --tape-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  virtual  tape  you  want  to
          retrieve from the virtual tape shelf (VTS).

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway you want to retrieve
          the virtual tape to. Use the  ListGateways  operation  to  return  a
          list of gateways for your account and Amazon Web Services Region.

          You  retrieve  archived  virtual  tapes  to only one gateway and the
          gateway must be a tape gateway.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TapeARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the retrieved virtual tape.
