DESCRIBE-TAPE-ARCHIVES()                              DESCRIBE-TAPE-ARCHIVES()



NAME
       describe-tape-archives -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  description  of specified virtual tapes in the virtual tape
       shelf (VTS). This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.

       If  a  specific  TapeARN  is  not  specified, Storage Gateway returns a
       description of all virtual tapes found in the VTS associated with  your
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-tape-archives is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: TapeArchives

SYNOPSIS
            describe-tape-archives
          [--tape-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --tape-arns (list)
          Specifies one or more unique Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that  rep-
          resent the virtual tapes you want to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TapeArchives -> (list)
          An array of virtual tape objects in the virtual  tape  shelf  (VTS).
          The  description  includes  of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
          virtual tapes. The information returned includes the Amazon Resource
          Names  (ARNs)  of the tapes, size of the tapes, status of the tapes,
          progress of the description, and tape barcode.

          (structure)
              Represents a virtual tape that is archived in the  virtual  tape
              shelf (VTS).

              TapeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an archived virtual tape.

              TapeBarcode -> (string)
                 The barcode that identifies the archived virtual tape.

              TapeCreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the virtual tape was created.

              TapeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the archived virtual tape.

              CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  the  archiving  of the virtual tape was com-
                 pleted.

                 The default timestamp  format  is  in  the  ISO8601  extended
                 YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS'Z' format.

              RetrievedTo -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the tape gateway that the
                 virtual tape is being retrieved to.

                 The virtual tape is retrieved from  the  virtual  tape  shelf
                 (VTS).

              TapeStatus -> (string)
                 The current state of the archived virtual tape.

              TapeUsedInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of data stored on the virtual tape.

                 NOTE:
                     This  value  is  not available for tapes created prior to
                     May 13, 2015.

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master
                 key  (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage
                 Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only
                 be set when KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

              PoolId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  pool that was used to archive the tape. The
                 tapes in this pool are archived in the S3 storage class  that
                 is associated with the pool.

                 Valid Values: GLACIER | DEEP_ARCHIVE

              Worm -> (boolean)
                 Set   to   true   if   the   archived   tape   is  stored  as
                 write-once-read-many (WORM).

              RetentionStartDate -> (timestamp)
                 If the archived tape is subject to tape retention  lock,  the
                 date that the archived tape started being retained.

              PoolEntryDate -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the tape entered the custom tape pool.

                 The  default  timestamp  format  is  in  the ISO8601 extended
                 YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS'Z' format.

       Marker -> (string)
          An opaque string that indicates the position at  which  the  virtual
          tapes  that  were  fetched for description ended. Use this marker in
          your next request to fetch the next set of virtual tapes in the vir-
          tual  tape  shelf  (VTS).  If  there  are  no  more virtual tapes to
          describe, this field does not appear in the response.
