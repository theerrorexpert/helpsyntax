DELETE-BANDWIDTH-RATE-LIMIT()                    DELETE-BANDWIDTH-RATE-LIMIT()



NAME
       delete-bandwidth-rate-limit -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  bandwidth rate limits of a gateway. You can delete either
       the upload and download bandwidth rate limit, or you can  delete  both.
       If  you  delete  only  one  of  the  limits,  the  other  limit remains
       unchanged. To specify which  gateway  to  work  with,  use  the  Amazon
       Resource  Name  (ARN) of the gateway in your request. This operation is
       supported only for the stored volume, cached volume, and  tape  gateway
       types.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bandwidth-rate-limit
          --gateway-arn <value>
          --bandwidth-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --bandwidth-type (string)
          One of the BandwidthType values that indicates the gateway bandwidth
          rate limit to delete.

          Valid Values: UPLOAD | DOWNLOAD | ALL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.
