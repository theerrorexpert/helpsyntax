DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a  file  gateway to an Active Directory domain. This operation is
       only supported for file gateways that support the SMB file protocol.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            join-domain
          --gateway-arn <value>
          --domain-name <value>
          [--organizational-unit <value>]
          [--domain-controllers <value>]
          [--timeout-in-seconds <value>]
          --user-name <value>
          --password <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain that you want the gateway to join.

       --organizational-unit (string)
          The organizational unit (OU) is a container in an  Active  Directory
          that  can  hold  users,  groups,  computers,  and other OUs and this
          parameter specifies the OU that the gateway will join within the  AD
          domain.

       --domain-controllers (list)
          List  of IPv4 addresses, NetBIOS names, or host names of your domain
          server. If you need to specify the port number include it after  the
          colon (:). For example, mydc.mydomain.com:389 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --timeout-in-seconds (integer)
          Specifies  the  time  in  seconds, in which the JoinDomain operation
          must complete. The default is 20 seconds.

       --user-name (string)
          Sets the user name of user who has permission to add the gateway  to
          the  Active  Directory  domain.  The  domain  user account should be
          enabled to join computers to the domain. For example,  you  can  use
          the  domain  administrator account or an account with delegated per-
          missions to join computers to the domain.

       --password (string)
          Sets the password of the user who has permission to add the  gateway
          to the Active Directory domain.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway that joined the
          domain.

       ActiveDirectoryStatus -> (string)
          Indicates the status of the gateway as a member of the Active Direc-
          tory domain.

          o ACCESS_DENIED : Indicates that the JoinDomain operation failed due
            to an authentication error.

          o DETACHED : Indicates that gateway is not joined to a domain.

          o JOINED : Indicates that the  gateway  has  successfully  joined  a
            domain.

          o JOINING : Indicates that a JoinDomain operation is in progress.

          o NETWORK_ERROR  : Indicates that JoinDomain operation failed due to
            a network or connectivity error.

          o TIMEOUT : Indicates that the JoinDomain operation  failed  because
            the operation didn't complete within the allotted time.

          o UNKNOWN_ERROR : Indicates that the JoinDomain operation failed due
            to another type of error.
