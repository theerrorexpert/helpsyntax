NAME
       describe-file-system-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  file  system association information. This operation is only
       supported for FSx File Gateways.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-file-system-associations
          --file-system-association-arn-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-association-arn-list (list)
          An array containing the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of each file sys-
          tem association to be described.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage  used  for  the
                 audit logs.

              GatewayARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  List-
                 Gateways operation to return a  list  of  gateways  for  your
                 account and Amazon Web Services Region.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A  list  of  up  to  50  tags assigned to the SMB file share,
                 sorted alphabetically by key name. Each tag  is  a  key-value
                 pair.

                 (structure)
                     A  key-value  pair  that  helps  you  manage, filter, and
                     search for your resource.  Allowed  characters:  letters,
                     white space, and numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the

                        Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

                     Value -> (string)

                     Refreshes  a  file  share's  cache  by using Time To Live
                     (TTL). TTL is the length of time since the  last  refresh
                     after  which access to the directory would cause the file
                     gateway to first refresh that directory's  contents  from
                     the  Amazon  S3 bucket or Amazon FSx file system. The TTL
                     duration is in seconds.

                     Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30

              EndpointNetworkConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies  network  configuration information for the gateway
                 associated with the Amazon FSx file system.

                 NOTE:
                     If multiple file systems are associated with  this  gate-
                     way, this parameter's IpAddresses field is required.

                 IpAddresses -> (list)
                     A  list  of  gateway IP addresses on which the associated

                     NOTE:
                        If multiple file  systems  are  associated  with  this
                        gateway, this field is required.
