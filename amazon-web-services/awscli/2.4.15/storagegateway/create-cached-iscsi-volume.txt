CREATE-CACHED-ISCSI-VOLUME()                      CREATE-CACHED-ISCSI-VOLUME()



NAME
       create-cached-iscsi-volume -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  cached  volume  on  a specified cached volume gateway. This
       operation is only supported in the cached volume gateway type.

       NOTE:
          Cache storage must be allocated to the gateway before you can create
          a cached volume. Use the  AddCache operation to add cache storage to
          a gateway.

       In the request, you must specify the gateway, size  of  the  volume  in
       bytes, the iSCSI target name, an IP address on which to expose the tar-
       get, and a unique client token. In response, the  gateway  creates  the
       volume  and returns information about it. This information includes the
       volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN), its size, and the iSCSI  target  ARN
       that initiators can use to connect to the volume target.

       Optionally,  you  can  provide  the  ARN  for an existing volume as the
       SourceVolumeARN for this cached volume, which creates an exact copy  of
       the existing volumes latest recovery point. The VolumeSizeInBytes value
       must be equal to or larger than the  size  of  the  copied  volume,  in
       bytes.

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --volume-size-in-bytes (long)
          The size of the volume in bytes.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The snapshot ID (e.g. "snap-1122aabb") of the snapshot to restore as
          the new cached volume. Specify this field if you want to create  the
          iSCSI storage volume from a snapshot; otherwise, do not include this
          field. To list snapshots for your account use  DescribeSnapshots  in
          the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference .

       --target-name (string)
          The  name  of  the iSCSI target used by an initiator to connect to a
          volume and used as a suffix for the target ARN. For example,  speci-
          fying   TargetName   as  myvolume  results  in  the  target  ARN  of
          arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-2:111122223333:gate-
          way/sgw-12A3456B/target/iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume . The target
          name must be unique across all volumes on a gateway.

          If you don't specify a value, Storage Gateway uses  the  value  that
          was previously used for this volume as the new target name.

       --source-volume-arn (string)
          The  ARN  for  an existing volume. Specifying this ARN makes the new
          volume into an exact copy of the specified existing volume's  latest
          recovery point. The VolumeSizeInBytes value for this new volume must
          be equal to or larger than the  size  of  the  existing  volume,  in
          bytes.

       --network-interface-id (string)
          The  network  interface  of the gateway on which to expose the iSCSI
          target. Only IPv4 addresses are accepted. Use  DescribeGatewayInfor-
          mation  to get a list of the network interfaces available on a gate-
          way.

          Valid Values: A valid IP address.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique identifier that you use to retry a request. If you retry  a
          request,  use  the  same  ClientToken  you  specified in the initial
          request.

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Set to true to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption  with  your  own
          KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key
          (CMK) used for Amazon S3  server-side  encryption.  Storage  Gateway
          does  not  support  asymmetric CMKs. This value can only be set when
          KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that you can assign to a cached volume. Each
          tag is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers that you can represent in UTF-8 format, and  the  following
              special  characters:  +  -  = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a
              tag's key is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a  tag's
              value is 256 characters.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for
              your resource. Allowed characters:  letters,  white  space,  and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VolumeARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the configured volume.

       TargetARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target, which  includes
          the iSCSI name that initiators can use to connect to the target.
