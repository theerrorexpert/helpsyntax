CREATE-STORED-ISCSI-VOLUME()                      CREATE-STORED-ISCSI-VOLUME()



NAME
       create-stored-iscsi-volume -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  volume  on a specified gateway. This operation is only sup-
       ported in the stored volume gateway type.

       The size of the volume to create is inferred from the  disk  size.  You
       can choose to preserve existing data on the disk, create volume from an
       existing snapshot, or create an empty volume. If you choose  to  create
       an  empty gateway volume, then any existing data on the disk is erased.

       In the request, you must specify the gateway and the  disk  information
       on  which you are creating the volume. In response, the gateway creates
       the volume and returns volume information such  as  the  volume  Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN), its size, and the iSCSI target ARN that initiators
       can use to connect to the volume target.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          --gateway-arn <value>
          --disk-id <value>
          [--snapshot-id <value>]
          --preserve-existing-data | --no-preserve-existing-data
          --target-name <value>
          --network-interface-id <value>
          [--kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted]
          [--kms-key <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --disk-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the gateway local disk that is  configured
          as  a stored volume. Use ListLocalDisks to list disk IDs for a gate-
          way.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The snapshot ID (e.g., "snap-1122aabb") of the snapshot  to  restore
          as  the  new stored volume. Specify this field if you want to create
          the iSCSI storage volume from a snapshot; otherwise, do not  include
          this field. To list snapshots for your account use DescribeSnapshots
          in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference .

       --preserve-existing-data | --no-preserve-existing-data (boolean)
          Set to true if you want to preserve the data on the local disk. Oth-
          erwise, set to false to create an empty volume.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --target-name (string)
          The  name  of  the iSCSI target used by an initiator to connect to a
          volume and used as a suffix for the target ARN. For example,  speci-
          fying   TargetName   as  myvolume  results  in  the  target  ARN  of
          arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-2:111122223333:gate-
          way/sgw-12A3456B/target/iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume . The target
          name must be unique across all volumes on a gateway.

          If you don't specify a value, Storage Gateway uses  the  value  that
          was previously used for this volume as the new target name.

       --network-interface-id (string)
          The  network  interface  of the gateway on which to expose the iSCSI
          target. Only IPv4 addresses are accepted. Use  DescribeGatewayInfor-
          mation  to get a list of the network interfaces available on a gate-
          way.

          Valid Values: A valid IP address.

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Set to true to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption  with  your  own
          KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key
          (CMK) used for Amazon S3  server-side  encryption.  Storage  Gateway
          does  not  support  asymmetric CMKs. This value can only be set when
          KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned  to  a  stored  volume.
          Each tag is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers representable in UTF-8 format, and  the  following  special
              characters:  +  - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a tag's key
              is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's  value  is
              256.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for
              your resource. Allowed characters:  letters,  white  space,  and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
