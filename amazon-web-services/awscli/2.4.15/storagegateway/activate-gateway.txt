ACTIVATE-GATEWAY()                                          ACTIVATE-GATEWAY()



NAME
       activate-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Activates  the  gateway  you  previously  deployed on your host. In the
       activation process, you specify information such as the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices  Region  that you want to use for storing snapshots or tapes, the
       time zone for scheduled snapshots the gateway snapshot schedule window,
       an  activation key, and a name for your gateway. The activation process
       also associates your gateway with your account. For  more  information,
       see  UpdateGatewayInformation .

       NOTE:
          You  must  turn on the gateway VM before you can activate your gate-
          way.

SYNOPSIS
            activate-gateway
          --activation-key <value>
          --gateway-name <value>
          --gateway-timezone <value>
          --gateway-region <value>
          [--gateway-type <value>]
          [--tape-drive-type <value>]
          [--medium-changer-type <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --activation-key (string)
          Your gateway activation key. You can obtain the  activation  key  by
          sending an HTTP GET request with redirects enabled to the gateway IP
          address (port 80). The redirect URL returned in  the  response  pro-
          vides  you  the  activation key for your gateway in the query string
          parameter  activationKey  .  It  may  also  include  other   activa-
          tion-related  parameters,  however, these are merely defaults -- the
          arguments you pass to the ActivateGateway  API  call  determine  the
          actual configuration of your gateway.

          For  more  information,  see  Getting  activation key in the Storage
          Gateway User Guide .

       --gateway-name (string)
          The name you configured for your gateway.

       --gateway-timezone (string)
          A value that indicates the time zone you want to set for  the  gate-
          way.  The time zone is of the format "GMT-hr:mm" or "GMT+hr:mm". For
          example, GMT-4:00 indicates the time is 4 hours behind GMT. GMT+2:00
          indicates  the  time is 2 hours ahead of GMT. The time zone is used,
          for example, for scheduling snapshots and your gateway's maintenance
          schedule.

       --gateway-region (string)
          A value that indicates the Amazon Web Services Region where you want
          to store your data. The gateway Amazon Web Services Region specified
          must  be  the same Amazon Web Services Region as the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Region in your Host header in the request. For  more  informa-
          tion  about  available Amazon Web Services Regions and endpoints for
          Storage Gateway, see Storage Gateway endpoints  and  quotas  in  the
          Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          Valid Values: See Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas in the Amazon
          Web Services General Reference .

       --gateway-type (string)
          A value that defines the type of gateway to activate. The type spec-
          ified  is  critical to all later functions of the gateway and cannot
          be changed after activation. The default value is CACHED .

          Valid Values:  STORED  |  CACHED  |  VTL  |  VTL_SNOW  |  FILE_S3  |
          FILE_FSX_SMB

       --tape-drive-type (string)
          The  value  that  indicates  the  type of tape drive to use for tape
          gateway. This field is optional.

          Valid Values: IBM-ULT3580-TD5

       --medium-changer-type (string)
          The value that indicates the type of medium changer to use for  tape
          gateway. This field is optional.

          Valid Values: STK-L700 | AWS-Gateway-VTL | IBM-03584L32-0402

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that you can assign to the gateway. Each tag
          is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers  that can be represented in UTF-8 format, and the following
              special characters: + - = . _ : / @. The  maximum  length  of  a
              tag's  key is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's
              value is 256 characters.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that helps you manage, filter, and  search  for
              your  resource.  Allowed  characters:  letters, white space, and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.
