       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-tape
          --gateway-arn <value>
          --tape-arn <value>
          [--bypass-governance-retention | --no-bypass-governance-retention]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway that  the  vir-
          tual tape to delete is associated with. Use the  ListGateways opera-
          tion to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon  Web
          Services Region.

       --tape-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual tape to delete.

       --bypass-governance-retention     |    --no-bypass-governance-retention
       (boolean)
          Set to TRUE to delete an archived tape that belongs to a custom pool
          with  tape  retention  lock. Only archived tapes with tape retention
          lock set to governance can be  deleted.  Archived  tapes  with  tape
          retention lock set to compliance can't be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TapeARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the deleted virtual tape.
