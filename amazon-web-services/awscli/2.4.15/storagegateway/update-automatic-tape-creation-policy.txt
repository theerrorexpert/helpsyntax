NAME
       update-automatic-tape-creation-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  automatic  tape creation policy of a gateway. Use this to
       update the policy with a new set of automatic tape creation rules. This
       is only supported for tape gateways.

       By default, there is no automatic tape creation policy.

       NOTE:
          A gateway can have only one automatic tape creation policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-automatic-tape-creation-policy
          --automatic-tape-creation-rules <value>
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --automatic-tape-creation-rules (list)
          An  automatic  tape  creation policy consists of a list of automatic
          tape creation rules. The rules determine when and how  to  automati-
          cally create new tapes.

          (structure)
              An  automatic  tape  creation  policy consists of automatic tape
              creation rules where each rule defines when and  how  to  create
              new  tapes.  For more information about automatic tape creation,
              see Creating Tapes Automatically .

              TapeBarcodePrefix -> (string)
                 A prefix that you append to the barcode of the  virtual  tape
                 that  you are creating. This prefix makes the barcode unique.

                 NOTE:
                     The prefix must be 1-4 characters in length and  must  be
                     one of the uppercase letters from A to Z.

              PoolId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for ar-
                 chiving. The tape in this pool is archived in the  Amazon  S3
                 storage  class that is associated with the pool. When you use
                 your backup application  to  eject  the  tape,  the  tape  is
                 archived  directly  into  the storage class (S3 Glacier or S3
                 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

                 Valid Values: GLACIER | DEEP_ARCHIVE

              TapeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the virtual tape capacity.

              MinimumNumTapes -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of available virtual tapes that the  gate-
                 way  maintains  at  all  times. If the number of tapes on the
                 gateway goes below this value, the gateway  creates  as  many
                 new  tapes as are needed to have MinimumNumTapes on the gate-
                 way. For more information about automatic tape creation,  see
                 Creating Tapes Automatically .

              Worm -> (boolean)
                 Set  to  true  to  indicate  that tapes are to be archived as
                 write-once-read-many (WORM). Set to false when  WORM  is  not
                 enabled for tapes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TapeBarcodePrefix=string,PoolId=string,TapeSizeInBytes=long,MinimumNumTapes=integer,Worm=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TapeBarcodePrefix": "string",
              "PoolId": "string",
              "TapeSizeInBytes": long,
              "MinimumNumTapes": integer,
              "Worm": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.
