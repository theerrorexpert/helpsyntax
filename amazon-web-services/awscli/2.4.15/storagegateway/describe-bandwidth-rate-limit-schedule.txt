NAME
       describe-bandwidth-rate-limit-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about the bandwidth rate limit schedule of a gate-
       way. By default, gateways do not have bandwidth rate  limit  schedules,
       which  means no bandwidth rate limiting is in effect. This operation is
       supported only for volume, tape and S3 file gateways. FSx file gateways
       do not support bandwidth rate limits.

       This  operation  returns  information  about a gateway's bandwidth rate
       limit schedule. A bandwidth rate limit schedule consists of one or more
       bandwidth rate limit intervals. A bandwidth rate limit interval defines
       a period of time on one or more days of the week,  during  which  band-
       width rate limits are specified for uploading, downloading, or both.

       A  bandwidth  rate  limit  interval consists of one or more days of the
       week, a start hour and minute, an ending hour and minute, and bandwidth
       rate limits for uploading and downloading

       If  no bandwidth rate limit schedule intervals are set for the gateway,
       this operation returns an empty response. To specify which  gateway  to
       describe,  use  the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your
       request.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-bandwidth-rate-limit-schedule
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       BandwidthRateLimitIntervals -> (list)
          An array that contains the bandwidth rate limit intervals for a tape
          or volume gateway.

          (structure)
              Describes a bandwidth rate limit interval for a gateway. A band-
              width rate limit schedule consists of one or more bandwidth rate
              limit  intervals.  A  bandwidth  rate  limit  interval defines a
              period of time on one or more days of  the  week,  during  which
              bandwidth  rate limits are specified for uploading, downloading,
              or both.

              StartHourOfDay -> (integer)
                 The hour of the day to start the bandwidth rate limit  inter-
                 val.

              StartMinuteOfHour -> (integer)
                 The  minute  of  the  hour  to start the bandwidth rate limit
                 interval. The interval begins at the start of that minute. To
                 begin  an  interval exactly at the start of the hour, use the
                 value 0 .

              EndHourOfDay -> (integer)
                 The hour of the day to end the bandwidth rate limit interval.

              EndMinuteOfHour -> (integer)
                 The minute of the hour to end the bandwidth rate limit inter-
                 val.

                 WARNING:
                     The bandwidth rate limit interval ends at the end of  the
                     minute. To end an interval at the end of an hour, use the
                     value 59 .

              DaysOfWeek -> (list)
                 The days of the week component of the  bandwidth  rate  limit
                 interval, represented as ordinal numbers from 0 to 6, where 0
                 represents Sunday and 6 represents Saturday.

                 (integer)

              AverageUploadRateLimitInBitsPerSec -> (long)
                 The average upload rate limit component of the bandwidth rate
                 limit  interval,  in  bits  per  second.  This field does not
                 appear in the response if the upload rate limit is not set.

              AverageDownloadRateLimitInBitsPerSec -> (long)
                 The average download rate limit component  of  the  bandwidth
                 rate  limit interval, in bits per second. This field does not
                 appear in the response if the download rate limit is not set.
