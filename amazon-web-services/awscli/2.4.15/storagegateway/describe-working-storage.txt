DESCRIBE-WORKING-STORAGE()                          DESCRIBE-WORKING-STORAGE()



NAME
       describe-working-storage -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the working storage of a gateway. This opera-
       tion is only supported in the stored volumes gateway type. This  opera-
       tion  is  deprecated  in  cached  volumes  API  version (20120630). Use
       DescribeUploadBuffer instead.

       NOTE:
          Working storage is also referred to as upload buffer. You  can  also
          use  the  DescribeUploadBuffer  operation  to add upload buffer to a
          stored volume gateway.

       The response includes disk IDs that are configured as working  storage,
       and it includes the amount of working storage allocated and used.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-working-storage
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       DiskIds -> (list)
          An  array  of  the  gateway's  local disk IDs that are configured as
          working storage. Each local disk ID is specified as a string  (mini-
          mum  length  of  1 and maximum length of 300). If no local disks are
          configured as working storage, then the DiskIds array is empty.

          (string)

       WorkingStorageUsedInBytes -> (long)
          The total working storage in bytes in use  by  the  gateway.  If  no
          working storage is configured for the gateway, this field returns 0.

       WorkingStorageAllocatedInBytes -> (long)
          The total working storage in bytes allocated for the gateway. If  no
          working storage is configured for the gateway, this field returns 0.
