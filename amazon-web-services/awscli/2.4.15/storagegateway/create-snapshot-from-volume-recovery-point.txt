CREATE-SNAPSHOT-FROM-VOLUME-RECOVECREATE-SNAPSHOT-FROM-VOLUME-RECOVERY-POINT()



NAME
       create-snapshot-from-volume-recovery-point -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates  a  snapshot  of a gateway from a volume recovery point. This
       operation is only supported in the cached volume gateway type.

       A volume recovery point is a point in time at which  all  data  of  the
       volume is consistent and from which you can create a snapshot. To get a
       list of volume recovery point for cached volume gateway, use   ListVol-
       umeRecoveryPoints .

       In  the CreateSnapshotFromVolumeRecoveryPoint request, you identify the
       volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also  pro-
       vide  a description for the snapshot. When the gateway takes a snapshot
       of the specified volume, the snapshot and its description appear in the
       Storage  Gateway  console. In response, the gateway returns you a snap-
       shot ID. You can use this snapshot ID to check the snapshot progress or
       later use it when you want to create a volume from a snapshot.

       NOTE:
          To  list  or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For
          more information, see DescribeSnapshots  or  DeleteSnapshot  in  the
          Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference .

SYNOPSIS
            create-snapshot-from-volume-recovery-point
          --volume-arn <value>
          --snapshot-description <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --volume-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the iSCSI volume target. Use the
          DescribeStorediSCSIVolumes operation to return to retrieve the  Tar-
          getARN for specified VolumeARN.

       --snapshot-description (string)
          Textual  description  of the snapshot that appears in the Amazon EC2
          console, Elastic Block Store  snapshots  panel  in  the  Description
          field, and in the Storage Gateway snapshot Details pane, Description
          field.

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to a snapshot. Each tag
          is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers representable in UTF-8 format, and  the  following  special
              characters:  +  - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a tag's key
              is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's  value  is
              256.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for
              your resource. Allowed characters:  letters,  white  space,  and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SnapshotId -> (string)
          The ID of the snapshot.

       VolumeARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the iSCSI volume target.  Use  the
          DescribeStorediSCSIVolumes  operation to return to retrieve the Tar-
          getARN for specified VolumeARN.

       VolumeRecoveryPointTime -> (string)
          The time the volume was created from the recovery point.
