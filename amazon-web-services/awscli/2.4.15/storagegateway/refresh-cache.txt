REFRESH-CACHE()                                                REFRESH-CACHE()



NAME
       refresh-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Refreshes the cached inventory of objects for the specified file share.
       This operation finds objects in the Amazon S3 bucket that  were  added,
       removed,  or  replaced  since the gateway last listed the bucket's con-
       tents and cached the results. This operation does not import files into
       the S3 File Gateway cache storage. It only updates the cached inventory
       to reflect changes in the inventory of the objects in  the  S3  bucket.
       This operation is only supported in the S3 File Gateway types.

       You  can  subscribe  to  be notified through an Amazon CloudWatch event
       when your RefreshCache operation completes. For more  information,  see
       Getting  notified  about  file  operations  in the Storage Gateway User
       Guide . This operation is Only supported for S3 File Gateways.

       When this API is called, it only initiates the refresh operation.  When
       the API call completes and returns a success code, it doesn't necessar-
       ily mean that the file  refresh  has  completed.  You  should  use  the
       refresh-complete  notification to determine that the operation has com-
       pleted before you check for new files on the gateway  file  share.  You
       can  subscribe  to  be  notified  through  a CloudWatch event when your
       RefreshCache operation completes.

       Throttle limit: This API is asynchronous, so the gateway will accept no
       more   than   two  refreshes  at  any  time.  We  recommend  using  the
       refresh-complete CloudWatch event  notification  before  issuing  addi-
       tional  requests. For more information, see Getting notified about file
       operations in the Storage Gateway User Guide .

       If you invoke the RefreshCache API when two requests are already  being
       processed, any new request will cause an InvalidGatewayRequestException
       error because too many requests were sent to the server.

       For more information, see Getting notified about file operations in the
       Storage Gateway User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            refresh-cache
          --file-share-arn <value>
          [--folder-list <value>]
          [--recursive | --no-recursive]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-share-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  file  share you want to
          refresh.

       --folder-list (list)
          A comma-separated list of the paths of folders  to  refresh  in  the
          cache.  The  default  is  ["/"  ]. The default refreshes objects and
          folders at the root of the Amazon S3 bucket. If Recursive is set  to
          true  ,  the  entire  S3 bucket that the file share has access to is
          refreshed.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --recursive | --no-recursive (boolean)
          A value that specifies whether to recursively refresh folders in the
          cache.  The refresh includes folders that were in the cache the last
          time the gateway listed the folder's contents. If this value set  to
          true  ,  each  folder  that  is  listed in FolderList is recursively
          updated.  Otherwise,  subfolders  listed  in  FolderList   are   not
          refreshed.  Only  objects  that are in folders listed directly under
          FolderList are found and used for the update. The default is true  .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To refresh the file share cache

       The  following refresh-cache example refreshes the cache for the speci-
       fied file share.

          aws storagegateway refresh-cache \
              --file-share-arn arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:111122223333:share/share-2FA12345

       Output:

          {
              "FileShareARN": "arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:111122223333:share/share-2FA12345",
              "NotificationId": "4954d4b1-abcd-ef01-1234-97950a7d3483"
          }

       For more information, see ListFileShares in  the  AWS  Storage  Gateway
       Service API Reference.

OUTPUT
       FileShareARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share.

       NotificationId -> (string)
          The randomly generated ID of the notification that was sent. This ID
          is in UUID format.
