SHUTDOWN-GATEWAY()                                          SHUTDOWN-GATEWAY()



NAME
       shutdown-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Shuts  down  a  gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the
       Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your  request.

       The  operation  shuts down the gateway service component running in the
       gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the host VM.

       NOTE:
          If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended  that  you  first
          shut  down  the  gateway  component in the VM to avoid unpredictable
          conditions.

       After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call  any  other  API  except
       StartGateway  ,   DescribeGatewayInformation  , and  ListGateways . For
       more information, see  ActivateGateway . Your applications cannot  read
       from  or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no snap-
       shots taken.

       NOTE:
          When you make a shutdown request, you will  get  a  200  OK  success
          response immediately. However, it might take some time for the gate-
          way to shut down. You can call the   DescribeGatewayInformation  API
          to check the status. For more information, see  ActivateGateway .

       If  do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway
       (using  DeleteGateway ) to no longer pay  software  charges  associated
       with the gateway.

SYNOPSIS
            shutdown-gateway
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.
