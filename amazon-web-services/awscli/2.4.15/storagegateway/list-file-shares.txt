LIST-FILE-SHARES()                                          LIST-FILE-SHARES()



NAME
       list-file-shares -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of the file shares for a specific S3 File Gateway, or the
       list of file shares that belong to the calling user account. This oper-
       ation is only supported for S3 File Gateways.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-file-shares  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: FileShareInfoList

SYNOPSIS
            list-file-shares
          [--gateway-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway whose file shares  you
          want  to  list.  If this field is not present, all file shares under
          your account are listed.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          aws storagegateway list-file-shares \
              --gateway-arn arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:209870788375:gateway/sgw-FB02E292

       Output:

          {
              "FileShareInfoList": [
                  {
                      "FileShareType": "NFS",
                      "FileShareARN": "arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:111122223333:share/share-2FA12345",
                      "FileShareId": "share-2FA12345",
                      "FileShareStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "GatewayARN": "arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:111122223333:gateway/sgw-FB0AAAAA"
                  }
              ],
              "Marker": null
          }

       Service API Reference.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          If  the request includes Marker , the response returns that value in
          this field.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If a value is present, there are more file shares to  return.  In  a
          subsequent  request,  use  NextMarker  as  the  value  for Marker to
          retrieve the next set of file shares.

       FileShareInfoList -> (list)
          An array of information about the S3 File Gateway's file shares.

          (structure)
              Describes a file share. Only supported S3 File Gateway.

              FileShareType -> (string)
                 The type of the file share.

              FileShareARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share.

              FileShareId -> (string)
                 The ID of the file share.

              FileShareStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the file share.

                 Valid Values: CREATING | UPDATING | AVAILABLE | DELETING

              GatewayARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  List-
                 Gateways  operation  to  return  a  list of gateways for your
                 account and Amazon Web Services Region.
