DESCRIBE-CACHE()                                              DESCRIBE-CACHE()



NAME
       describe-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the  cache of a gateway. This operation is
       only supported in the cached volume, tape, and file gateway types.

       The response includes disk IDs that are configured  as  cache,  and  it
       includes the amount of cache allocated and used.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cache
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       DiskIds -> (list)
          An array of strings that identify disks that are to be configured as
          working storage. Each string has a minimum length of 1  and  maximum
          length  of  300.  You  can get the disk IDs from the  ListLocalDisks
          API.

          (string)

       CacheAllocatedInBytes -> (long)
          The amount of cache in bytes allocated to a gateway.

       CacheUsedPercentage -> (double)
          Percent use of the gateway's cache storage. This metric applies only
          to  the  gateway-cached volume setup. The sample is taken at the end
          of the reporting period.

       CacheDirtyPercentage -> (double)
          The file share's contribution to the overall percentage of the gate-
          way's  cache that has not been persisted to Amazon Web Services. The
          sample is taken at the end of the reporting period.

       CacheHitPercentage -> (double)
          Percent of application read operations from the file shares that are
          served  from  cache. The sample is taken at the end of the reporting
          period.

       CacheMissPercentage -> (double)
          Percent of application read operations from the file shares that are
          not served from cache. The sample is taken at the end of the report-
          ing period.
