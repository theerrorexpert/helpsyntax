DESCRIBE-UPLOAD-BUFFER()                              DESCRIBE-UPLOAD-BUFFER()



NAME
       describe-upload-buffer -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the upload buffer of a gateway. This opera-
       tion is supported for the stored volume, cached volume, and tape  gate-
       way types.

       The  response  includes  disk  IDs that are configured as upload buffer
       space, and it includes the amount of upload buffer space allocated  and
       used.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-upload-buffer
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       DiskIds -> (list)
          An  array  of  the  gateway's  local disk IDs that are configured as
          working storage. Each local disk ID is specified as a string  (mini-
          mum  length  of  1 and maximum length of 300). If no local disks are
          configured as working storage, then the DiskIds array is empty.

          (string)

       UploadBufferUsedInBytes -> (long)
          The total number of bytes being used in the gateway's upload buffer.

       UploadBufferAllocatedInBytes -> (long)
          The  total  number  of  bytes  allocated  in the gateway's as upload
          buffer.
