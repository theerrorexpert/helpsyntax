UPDATE-SNAPSHOT-SCHEDULE()                          UPDATE-SNAPSHOT-SCHEDULE()



NAME
       update-snapshot-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a snapshot schedule configured for a gateway volume. This oper-
       ation is only supported in the cached volume and stored volume  gateway
       types.

       The default snapshot schedule for volume is once every 24 hours, start-
       ing at the creation time of the volume. You can use this API to  change
       the snapshot schedule configured for the volume.

       In  the  request  you  must  identify the gateway volume whose snapshot
       schedule you want to update, and the  schedule  information,  including
       when  you  want  the  snapshot  to begin on a day and the frequency (in
       hours) of snapshots.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-snapshot-schedule
          --volume-arn <value>
          --start-at <value>
          --recurrence-in-hours <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --volume-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume. Use  the   ListVolumes
          operation to return a list of gateway volumes.

       --start-at (integer)
          The  hour  of  the  day at which the snapshot schedule begins repre-
          sented as hh , where hh is the hour (0 to 23). The hour of  the  day
          is in the time zone of the gateway.

       --recurrence-in-hours (integer)
          Frequency  of  snapshots.  Specify the number of hours between snap-
          shots.

       --description (string)
          Optional description of the snapshot that  overwrites  the  existing
          description.

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to a snapshot. Each tag
          is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers  representable  in  UTF-8 format, and the following special
              characters: + - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a  tag's  key
              is  128  characters, and the maximum length for a tag's value is
              256.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that helps you manage, filter, and  search  for
              your  resource.  Allowed  characters:  letters, white space, and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VolumeARN -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the volume. Use the  ListVolumes
          operation to return a list of gateway volumes.
