ASSOCIATE-FILE-SYSTEM()                                ASSOCIATE-FILE-SYSTEM()



NAME
       associate-file-system -

DESCRIPTION
       Associate  an  Amazon  FSx file system with the FSx File Gateway. After
       the association process is complete, the file shares on the Amazon  FSx
       file  system  are available for access through the gateway. This opera-
       tion only supports the FSx File Gateway type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The user name of the user credential that has permission  to  access
          the  root  share  D$ of the Amazon FSx file system. The user account
          must belong to the Amazon FSx delegated admin user group.

       --password (string)
          The password of the user credential.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique string value that you supply that is used by the  FSx  File
          Gateway to ensure idempotent file system association creation.

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --location-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon FSx file system to as-
          sociate with the FSx File Gateway.

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that can be  assigned  to  the  file  system
          association. Each tag is a key-value pair.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for
              your resource. Allowed characters:  letters,  white  space,  and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --audit-destination-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage  used  for  the  audit
          logs.

       --cache-attributes (structure)
          The  refresh  cache  information for the file share or FSx file sys-
          tems.

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              Refreshes a file share's cache by using Time To Live (TTL).  TTL
              is  the length of time since the last refresh after which access
              to the directory would cause the file gateway to  first  refresh
              that  directory's  contents  from the Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon
              FSx file system. The TTL duration is in seconds.

              Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30 days)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds": integer
          }

       --endpoint-network-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the network  configuration  information  for  the  gateway
          associated with the Amazon FSx file system.

          NOTE:
              If  multiple file systems are associated with this gateway, this
              parameter's IpAddresses field is required.

          IpAddresses -> (list)
              A list of gateway IP addresses on which  the  associated  Amazon
              FSx file system is available.

              NOTE:
                 If  multiple  file  systems are associated with this gateway,
                 this field is required.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IpAddresses=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IpAddresses": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FileSystemAssociationARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the newly created file system association.
