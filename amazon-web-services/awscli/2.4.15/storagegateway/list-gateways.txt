LIST-GATEWAYS()                                                LIST-GATEWAYS()



NAME
       list-gateways -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists gateways owned by an Amazon Web Services account in an Amazon Web
       Services Region specified in the request. The returned list is  ordered
       by gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       By default, the operation returns a maximum of 100 gateways. This oper-
       ation supports pagination that allows you to optionally reduce the num-
       ber of gateways returned in a response.

       If you have more gateways than are returned in a response (that is, the
       response returns only a truncated list of your gateways), the  response
       contains  a  marker  that you can specify in your next request to fetch
       the next page of gateways.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-gateways is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Gateways

SYNOPSIS
            list-gateways
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list gateways for an account

       The following list-gateways command lists all the gateways defined  for
       an account:

          aws storagegateway list-gateways

       This  command outputs a JSON block that contains a list of gateway Ama-
       zon Resource Names (ARNs).

OUTPUT
       Gateways -> (list)
          An array of  GatewayInfo objects.

          (structure)
              Describes a gateway object.

              GatewayId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier assigned to your gateway during activa-
                 tion.  This  ID  becomes  part of the gateway Amazon Resource
                 Name (ARN), which you use as input for other operations.

              GatewayARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  List-
                 Gateways  operation  to  return  a  list of gateways for your
                 account and Amazon Web Services Region.

              GatewayType -> (string)
                 The type of the gateway.

              GatewayOperationalState -> (string)
                 The state of the gateway.

                 Valid Values: DISABLED | ACTIVE

              GatewayName -> (string)
                 The name of the gateway.

              Ec2InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon EC2 instance that was used to launch the
                 gateway.

              Ec2InstanceRegion -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services Region where the Amazon EC2 instance
                 is located.

              HostEnvironment -> (string)
                 The type of hardware or software platform on which the  gate-
                 way is running.

              HostEnvironmentId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  for  the specific instance of the host
                 platform running the gateway. This value  is  only  available
                 for  certain host environments, and its format depends on the
                 host environment type.

       Marker -> (string)
          Use the marker in your next request to fetch the next set  of  gate-
          ways  in the list. If there are no more gateways to list, this field
          does not appear in the response.
