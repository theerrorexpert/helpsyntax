UPDATE-BANDWIDTH-RATE-LIMIT-SCHEDULE()  UPDATE-BANDWIDTH-RATE-LIMIT-SCHEDULE()



NAME
       update-bandwidth-rate-limit-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  bandwidth rate limit schedule for a specified gateway. By
       default, gateways do not have bandwidth  rate  limit  schedules,  which
       means  no bandwidth rate limiting is in effect. Use this to initiate or
       update a gateway's bandwidth rate limit  schedule.  This  operation  is
       supported only for volume, tape and S3 file gateways. FSx file gateways
       do not support bandwidth rate limits.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-bandwidth-rate-limit-schedule
          --gateway-arn <value>
          --bandwidth-rate-limit-intervals <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --bandwidth-rate-limit-intervals (list)
          An array containing bandwidth rate limit schedule  intervals  for  a
          gateway. When no bandwidth rate limit intervals have been scheduled,
          the array is empty.

          (structure)
              Describes a bandwidth rate limit interval for a gateway. A band-
              width rate limit schedule consists of one or more bandwidth rate
              limit intervals. A  bandwidth  rate  limit  interval  defines  a
              period  of  time  on  one or more days of the week, during which
              bandwidth rate limits are specified for uploading,  downloading,
              or both.

              StartHourOfDay -> (integer)
                 The  hour of the day to start the bandwidth rate limit inter-
                 val.

              StartMinuteOfHour -> (integer)
                 The minute of the hour to  start  the  bandwidth  rate  limit
                 interval. The interval begins at the start of that minute. To
                 begin an interval exactly at the start of the hour,  use  the
                 value 0 .

              EndHourOfDay -> (integer)
                 The hour of the day to end the bandwidth rate limit interval.

              EndMinuteOfHour -> (integer)
                 The minute of the hour to end the bandwidth rate limit inter-
                 val.

                 WARNING:
                     The  bandwidth rate limit interval ends at the end of the
                     minute. To end an interval at the end of an hour, use the
                     value 59 .

              DaysOfWeek -> (list)
                 The  days  of  the week component of the bandwidth rate limit
                 interval, represented as ordinal numbers from 0 to 6, where 0
                 represents Sunday and 6 represents Saturday.

                 (integer)

              AverageUploadRateLimitInBitsPerSec -> (long)
                 The average upload rate limit component of the bandwidth rate
                 limit interval, in bits  per  second.  This  field  does  not
                 appear in the response if the upload rate limit is not set.

              AverageDownloadRateLimitInBitsPerSec -> (long)
                 The  average  download  rate limit component of the bandwidth
                 rate limit interval, in bits per second. This field does  not
                 appear in the response if the download rate limit is not set.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartHourOfDay=integer,StartMinuteOfHour=integer,EndHourOfDay=integer,EndMinuteOfHour=integer,DaysOfWeek=integer,integer,AverageUploadRateLimitInBitsPerSec=long,AverageDownloadRateLimitInBitsPerSec=long ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StartHourOfDay": integer,
              "StartMinuteOfHour": integer,
              "EndHourOfDay": integer,
              "EndMinuteOfHour": integer,
              "DaysOfWeek": [integer, ...],
              "AverageUploadRateLimitInBitsPerSec": long,
              "AverageDownloadRateLimitInBitsPerSec": long
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.
