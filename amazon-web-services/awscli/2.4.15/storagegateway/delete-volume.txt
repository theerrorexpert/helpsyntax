DELETE-VOLUME()                                                DELETE-VOLUME()



NAME
       delete-volume -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the specified storage volume that you previously created using
       the   CreateCachediSCSIVolume  or   CreateStorediSCSIVolume  API.  This
       operation  is  only  supported  in  the cached volume and stored volume
       types. For stored volume gateways, the local disk that  was  configured
       as  the  storage volume is not deleted. You can reuse the local disk to
       create another storage volume.

       Before you delete a volume, make sure there are no iSCSI connections to
       the  volume  you  are  deleting.  You should also make sure there is no
       snapshot in progress. You can use  the  Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud
       (Amazon  EC2) API to query snapshots on the volume you are deleting and
       check   the   snapshot   status.   For   more   information,   go    to
       DescribeSnapshots in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference .

       In  the request, you must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
       storage volume you want to delete.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-volume
          --volume-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --volume-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume. Use  the   ListVolumes
          operation to return a list of gateway volumes.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VolumeARN -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  storage volume that was
          deleted. It is the same ARN you provided in the request.
