LIST-VOLUME-RECOVERY-POINTS()                    LIST-VOLUME-RECOVERY-POINTS()



NAME
       list-volume-recovery-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  recovery  points for a specified gateway. This operation is
       only supported in the cached volume gateway type.

       Each cache volume has one recovery point. A volume recovery point is  a
       point  in  time  at which all data of the volume is consistent and from
       which you can create a snapshot or clone a new  cached  volume  from  a
       source  volume.  To  create a snapshot from a volume recovery point use
       the  CreateSnapshotFromVolumeRecoveryPoint operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-volume-recovery-points
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       VolumeRecoveryPointInfos -> (list)
          An array of  VolumeRecoveryPointInfo objects.

          (structure)
              Describes a storage volume recovery point object.

              VolumeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target.

              VolumeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size of the volume in bytes.

              VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                 The size of the data stored on the volume in bytes.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is not available for volumes created prior  to
                     May 13, 2015, until you store data on the volume.

              VolumeRecoveryPointTime -> (string)
                 The time the recovery point was taken.
