CREATE-TAPE-POOL()                                          CREATE-TAPE-POOL()



NAME
       create-tape-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new custom tape pool. You can use custom tape pool to enable
       tape retention lock on tapes that are archived in the custom pool.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-tape-pool
          --pool-name <value>
          --storage-class <value>
          [--retention-lock-type <value>]
          [--retention-lock-time-in-days <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pool-name (string)
          The name of the new custom tape pool.

       --storage-class (string)
          The storage class that is associated with the new custom pool.  When
          you  use  your  backup  application  to  eject the tape, the tape is
          archived directly into the storage class (S3 Glacier or  S3  Glacier
          Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

          Possible values:

          o DEEP_ARCHIVE

          o GLACIER

       --retention-lock-type (string)
          Tape  retention lock can be configured in two modes. When configured
          in governance mode, Amazon Web Services accounts with  specific  IAM
          permissions  are  authorized  to remove the tape retention lock from
          archived virtual tapes. When configured in compliance mode, the tape
          retention  lock  cannot  be  removed by any user, including the root
          Amazon Web Services account.

          Possible values:

          o COMPLIANCE

          o GOVERNANCE

          o NONE

       --retention-lock-time-in-days (integer)
          Tape retention lock time is set in days. Tape retention lock can  be
          enabled for up to 100 years (36,500 days).

       --tags (list)
          A  list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to tape pool. Each tag
          is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers  representable  in  UTF-8 format, and the following special
              characters: + - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a  tag's  key
              is  128  characters, and the maximum length for a tag's value is
              256.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that helps you manage, filter, and  search  for
              your  resource.  Allowed  characters:  letters, white space, and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PoolARN -> (string)
          The  unique  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that represents the custom
          tape pool. Use the  ListTapePools operation to return a list of tape
          pools for your account and Amazon Web Services Region.
