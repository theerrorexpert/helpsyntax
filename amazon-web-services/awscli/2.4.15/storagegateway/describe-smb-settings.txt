DESCRIBE-SMB-SETTINGS()                                DESCRIBE-SMB-SETTINGS()



NAME
       describe-smb-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a description of a Server Message Block (SMB) file share settings
       from a file gateway. This operation is only supported  for  file  gate-
       ways.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-smb-settings
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       DomainName -> (string)
          The name of the domain that the gateway is joined to.

       ActiveDirectoryStatus -> (string)
          Indicates  the  status  of  a gateway that is a member of the Active
          Directory domain.

          o ACCESS_DENIED : Indicates that the JoinDomain operation failed due
            to an authentication error.

          o DETACHED : Indicates that gateway is not joined to a domain.

          o JOINED  :  Indicates  that  the  gateway has successfully joined a
            domain.

          o JOINING : Indicates that a JoinDomain operation is in progress.

          o NETWORK_ERROR : Indicates that JoinDomain operation failed due  to
            a network or connectivity error.

          o TIMEOUT  :  Indicates that the JoinDomain operation failed because
            the operation didn't complete within the allotted time.

          o UNKNOWN_ERROR : Indicates that the JoinDomain operation failed due
            to another type of error.

       SMBGuestPasswordSet -> (boolean)
          This value is true if a password for the guest user smbguest is set,
          otherwise false . Only supported for S3 File Gateways.

          Valid Values: true | false

       SMBSecurityStrategy -> (string)
          The type of security strategy that was specified for file gateway.

          o ClientSpecified : If you use this option, requests are established
            based  on  what is negotiated by the client. This option is recom-
            mended when you want to maximize  compatibility  across  different
            clients  in your environment. Only supported for S3 File Gateways.

          o MandatorySigning : If you  use  this  option,  file  gateway  only
            allows  connections  from SMBv2 or SMBv3 clients that have signing
            enabled. This option works with SMB clients on  Microsoft  Windows
            Vista, Windows Server 2008 or newer.

          o MandatoryEncryption  :  If  you use this option, file gateway only
            allows  connections  from  SMBv3  clients  that  have   encryption
            enabled.  This  option is highly recommended for environments that
            handle sensitive data. This  option  works  with  SMB  clients  on
            Microsoft Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 or newer.

       FileSharesVisible -> (boolean)
          The  shares  on  this  gateway appear when listing shares. Only sup-
          ported for S3 File Gateways.

       SMBLocalGroups -> (structure)
          A list of Active Directory users and groups that have  special  per-
          missions for SMB file shares on the gateway.

          GatewayAdmins -> (list)
              A  list  of  Active  Directory  users and groups that have local
              Gateway   Admin   permissions.   Acceptable   formats   include:
              DOMAIN\User1 , user1 , DOMAIN\group1 , and group1 .

              Gateway  Admins  can use the Shared Folders Microsoft Management
              Console snap-in to force-close files that are open and locked.
