NAME
       describe-cached-iscsi-volumes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a description of the gateway volumes specified in the request.
       This operation is only supported in the cached volume gateway types.

       The list of gateway volumes in the request must be from one gateway. In
       the response, Storage Gateway returns volume information sorted by vol-
       ume Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cached-iscsi-volumes
          --volume-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --volume-arns (list)
          An array of strings where each string represents the Amazon Resource
          Name  (ARN)  of a cached volume. All of the specified cached volumes
          must be from the same gateway. Use  ListVolumes to get  volume  ARNs
          for a gateway.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CachediSCSIVolumes -> (list)
          An  array  of  objects where each object contains metadata about one
          cached volume.

          (structure)
              Describes an iSCSI cached volume.

              VolumeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage volume.

              VolumeId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the volume, e.g., vol-AE4B946D.

              VolumeType -> (string)
                 One of the VolumeType enumeration values that  describes  the
                 type of the volume.

              VolumeStatus -> (string)
                 One  of  the  VolumeStatus values that indicates the state of
                 the storage volume.

              VolumeAttachmentStatus -> (string)
                 A value that indicates whether a storage volume  is  attached
                 to  or  detached  from  a  gateway. For more information, see
                 Moving your volumes to a different gateway .

              VolumeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the volume capacity.

              VolumeProgress -> (double)
                 Represents the percentage complete if the volume is restoring
                 or  bootstrapping  that represents the percent of data trans-
                 ferred. This field does not appear in  the  response  if  the
                 cached volume is not restoring or bootstrapping.

              SourceSnapshotId -> (string)
                 If  the cached volume was created from a snapshot, this field
                 contains the snapshot ID used,  e.g.,  snap-78e22663.  Other-
                 wise, this field is not included.

              VolumeiSCSIAttributes -> (structure)
                 An  VolumeiSCSIAttributes object that represents a collection
                 of iSCSI attributes for one stored volume.

                 TargetARN -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target.

                 NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                     The network interface identifier.

                 NetworkInterfacePort -> (integer)
                     The port used to communicate with iSCSI targets.

                 LunNumber -> (integer)
                     The logical disk number.

                 ChapEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether mutual CHAP is enabled  for  the  iSCSI
                     target.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  the  volume  was created. Volumes created prior to
                 March 28, 2017 dont have this timestamp.

              VolumeUsedInBytes -> (long)
                 The size of the data stored on  the  volume  in  bytes.  This
                 value  is  calculated  based on the number of blocks that are
                 touched, instead of the actual amount of data  written.  This
                 value  can  be  useful for sequential write patterns but less
                 accurate for random write patterns. VolumeUsedInBytes is dif-
                 ferent  from  the compressed size of the volume, which is the
                 value that is used to calculate your bill.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is not available for volumes created prior  to
                     May 13, 2015, until you store data on the volume.

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master
                 key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption.  Storage
                 Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only
                 be set when KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

              TargetName -> (string)
                 The name of the iSCSI target used by an initiator to  connect
                 to  a  volume  and  used  as a suffix for the target ARN. For
                 example, specifying TargetName as  myvolume  results  in  the
                 target          ARN          of          arn:aws:storagegate-
                 way:us-east-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/tar-
                 get/iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume . The target name must be
                 unique across all volumes on a gateway.

                 If you don't specify a value, Storage Gateway uses the  value
                 that  was  previously  used for this volume as the new target
                 name.
