SYNOPSIS
            update-maintenance-start-time
          --gateway-arn <value>
          --hour-of-day <value>
          --minute-of-hour <value>
          [--day-of-week <value>]
          [--day-of-month <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --hour-of-day (integer)
          The hour component of the maintenance start time represented as hh ,
          where hh is the hour (00 to 23). The hour of the day is in the  time
          zone of the gateway.

       --minute-of-hour (integer)
          The minute component of the maintenance start time represented as mm
          , where mm is the minute (00 to 59). The minute of the  hour  is  in
          the time zone of the gateway.

       --day-of-week (integer)
          The  day  of  the  week component of the maintenance start time week
          represented as an ordinal number from 0 to  6,  where  0  represents
          Sunday and 6 Saturday.

       --day-of-month (integer)
          The  day of the month component of the maintenance start time repre-
          sented as an ordinal number from 1 to 28,  where  1  represents  the
          first  day of the month and 28 represents the last day of the month.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.
