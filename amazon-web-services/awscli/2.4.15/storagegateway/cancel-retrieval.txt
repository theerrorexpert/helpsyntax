CANCEL-RETRIEVAL()                                          CANCEL-RETRIEVAL()



NAME
       cancel-retrieval -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels  retrieval  of a virtual tape from the virtual tape shelf (VTS)
       to a gateway after the retrieval process is initiated. The virtual tape
       is  returned  to  the VTS. This operation is only supported in the tape
       gateway type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-retrieval
          --gateway-arn <value>
          --tape-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --tape-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual tape you want to  can-
          cel retrieval for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TapeARN -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  virtual  tape for which
          retrieval was canceled.
