LIST-FILE-SYSTEM-ASSOCIATIONS()                LIST-FILE-SYSTEM-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-file-system-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of FileSystemAssociationSummary objects. Each object con-
       tains a summary of a file system association. This  operation  is  only
       supported for FSx File Gateways.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-file-system-associations  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: FileSystemAssociationSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-file-system-associations
          [--gateway-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          If  the request includes Marker , the response returns that value in
          this field.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If a value is present, there are more file  system  associations  to
          return.  In  a  subsequent  request, use NextMarker as the value for
          Marker to retrieve the next set of file system associations.

       FileSystemAssociationSummaryList -> (list)
          An array of information about the Amazon FSx gateway's  file  system
          associations.

          (structure)
              Gets  the  summary returned by ListFileSystemAssociation , which
              is a summary of a created file system association.

              FileSystemAssociationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the file system association.

              FileSystemAssociationARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  file  system  associa-
                 tion.

              FileSystemAssociationStatus -> (string)
                 The  status of the file share. Valid Values: AVAILABLE | CRE-
                 ATING | DELETING | FORCE_DELETING | UPDATING | ERROR

              GatewayARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  List-
                 Gateways  operation  to  return  a  list of gateways for your
                 account and Amazon Web Services Region.
