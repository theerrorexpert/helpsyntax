LIST-TAPE-POOLS()                                            LIST-TAPE-POOLS()



NAME
       list-tape-pools -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists custom tape pools. You specify custom tape pools to list by spec-
       ifying one or more custom tape pool Amazon Resource  Names  (ARNs).  If
       you  don't specify a custom tape pool ARN, the operation lists all cus-
       tom tape pools.

       This operation supports pagination.  You  can  optionally  specify  the
       Limit  parameter  in  the body to limit the number of tape pools in the
       response. If the number of tape pools returned in the response is trun-
       cated,  the response includes a Marker element that you can use in your
       subsequent request to retrieve the next set of tape pools.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tape-pools is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: PoolInfos

SYNOPSIS
            list-tape-pools
          [--pool-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pool-arns (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of each of the custom tape pools you
          want to list. If you don't specify  a  custom  tape  pool  ARN,  the
          response lists all custom tape pools.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PoolInfos -> (list)
          An array of PoolInfo objects, where each object describes  a  single
          custom  tape  pool. If there are no custom tape pools, the PoolInfos
          is an empty array.

          (structure)
              Describes a custom tape pool.

              PoolARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom tape  pool.  Use
                 the   ListTapePools operation to return a list of custom tape
                 pools for your account and Amazon Web Services Region.

              PoolName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom tape pool. PoolName can use all  ASCII
                 characters, except '/' and ''.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The  storage  class  that is associated with the custom pool.
                 When you use your backup application to eject the  tape,  the
                 tape  is archived directly into the storage class (S3 Glacier
                 or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

              RetentionLockType -> (string)
                 Tape retention lock type, which  can  be  configured  in  two
                 modes.  When  configured  in governance mode, Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices accounts with specific IAM permissions  are  authorized
                 to  remove  the  tape  retention  lock  from archived virtual
                 tapes. When configured in compliance mode, the tape retention
                 lock cannot be removed by any user, including the root Amazon
                 Web Services account.

              RetentionLockTimeInDays -> (integer)
                 Tape retention lock time is set in days. Tape retention  lock
                 can be enabled for up to 100 years (36,500 days).

              PoolStatus -> (string)
                 Status of the custom tape pool. Pool can be ACTIVE or DELETED
                 .

       Marker -> (string)
          A string that indicates the position at which to begin the  returned
          list  of tape pools. Use the marker in your next request to continue
          pagination of tape pools. If there are no more tape pools  to  list,
          this element does not appear in the response body.
