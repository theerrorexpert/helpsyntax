START-GATEWAY()                                                START-GATEWAY()



NAME
       start-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a gateway that you previously shut down (see  ShutdownGateway ).
       After the gateway starts, you can  then  make  other  API  calls,  your
       applications  can  read  from or write to the gateway's storage volumes
       and you will be able to take snapshot backups.

       NOTE:
          When you make a request, you will get  a  200  OK  success  response
          immediately.  However, it might take some time for the gateway to be
          ready. You should call   DescribeGatewayInformation  and  check  the
          status before making any additional API calls. For more information,
          see  ActivateGateway .

       To specify which gateway to start, use the Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)
       of the gateway in your request.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-gateway
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.
