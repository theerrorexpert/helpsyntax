NAME
       update-nfs-file-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a Network File System (NFS) file share. This operation is only
       supported in S3 File Gateways.

       NOTE:
          To leave a file share field unchanged, set the  corresponding  input
          field to null.

       Updates the following file share settings:

       o Default storage class for your S3 bucket

       o Metadata defaults for your S3 bucket

       o Allowed NFS clients for your file share

       o Squash settings

       o Write status of your file share

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --file-share-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share to be updated.

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own
          KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric  customer  master  key
          (CMK)  used  for  Amazon  S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway
          does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only  be  set  when
          KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

       --nfs-file-share-defaults (structure)
          The default values for the file share. Optional.

          FileMode -> (string)
              The  Unix file mode in the form "nnnn". For example, 0666 repre-
              sents the default file mode inside the file share.  The  default
              value is 0666 .

          DirectoryMode -> (string)
              The  Unix  directory  mode in the form "nnnn". For example, 0666
              represents the default access mode for  all  directories  inside
              the file share. The default value is 0777 .

          GroupId -> (long)
              The  default  group ID for the file share (unless the files have
              another group ID specified). The default value is nfsnobody .

          OwnerId -> (long)
              The default owner ID for files in the  file  share  (unless  the
              files  have  another  owner  ID specified). The default value is
              nfsnobody .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FileMode=string,DirectoryMode=string,GroupId=long,OwnerId=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FileMode": "string",
            "DirectoryMode": "string",
            "GroupId": long,
            "OwnerId": long
          }

       --default-storage-class (string)
          The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon  S3  bucket
          by  the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING
          . Optional.

          Valid Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING |  S3_STANDARD_IA
          | S3_ONEZONE_IA

       --object-acl (string)
          A  value  that  sets  the  access  control list (ACL) permission for
          objects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts  objects  into.
          The default value is private .

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

          o aws-exec-read

       --client-list (list)
          The  list of clients that are allowed to access the S3 File Gateway.
          The list must contain  either  valid  IP  addresses  or  valid  CIDR
          blocks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --squash (string)
          The user mapped to anonymous user.

          Valid values are the following:

          o RootSquash : Only root is mapped to anonymous user.

          o NoSquash : No one is mapped to anonymous user.

          o AllSquash : Everyone is mapped to anonymous user.

       --read-only | --no-read-only (boolean)
          A  value  that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value
          to true to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to false
          .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --guess-mime-type-enabled | --no-guess-mime-type-enabled (boolean)
          A  value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects
          based on file extensions. Set this value to true to enable MIME type
          guessing, otherwise set to false . The default value is true .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --requester-pays | --no-requester-pays (boolean)
          A  value  that  sets  who  pays the cost of the request and the cost
          associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this  value  is
          set to true , the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket
          owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always  pays  the  cost  of
          storing data.

          NOTE:
              RequesterPays  is  a  configuration for the S3 bucket that backs
              the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the  file
              share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --file-share-name (string)
          The name of the file share. Optional.

          NOTE:
              FileShareName  must  be set if an S3 prefix name is set in Loca-
              tionARN , or if an access point or access point alias is used.

       --cache-attributes (structure)
          Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              Refreshes a file share's cache by using Time To Live (TTL).  TTL
              is  the length of time since the last refresh after which access
              to the directory would cause the file gateway to  first  refresh
              that  directory's  contents  from the Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon
              FSx file system. The TTL duration is in seconds.

              Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30 days)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds": integer
          }

       --notification-policy (string)
          The notification policy of  the  file  share.  SettlingTimeInSeconds
          controls  the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time
          a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notifi-
          cation.  Because  clients  can make many small writes to files, it's
          best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generat-
          ing multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

          NOTE:
              SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the  object
              uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

          The  following  example  sets  NotificationPolicy  on with Settling-
          TimeInSeconds set to 60.
              {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}

          The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.
              {}

       --audit-destination-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FileShareARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the updated file share.
