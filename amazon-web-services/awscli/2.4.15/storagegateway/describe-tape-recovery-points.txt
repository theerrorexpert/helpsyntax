DESCRIBE-TAPE-RECOVERY-POINTS()                DESCRIBE-TAPE-RECOVERY-POINTS()



NAME
       describe-tape-recovery-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of virtual tape recovery points that are available for
       the specified tape gateway.

       A recovery point is a point-in-time view of a virtual tape at which all
       the  data  on  the virtual tape is consistent. If your gateway crashes,
       virtual tapes that have recovery points can be recovered to a new gate-
       way. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-tape-recovery-points  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: TapeRecoveryPointInfos

SYNOPSIS
            describe-tape-recovery-points
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       TapeRecoveryPointInfos -> (list)
          An array of TapeRecoveryPointInfos that are available for the speci-
          fied gateway.

          (structure)
              Describes a recovery point.

              TapeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual tape.

              TapeRecoveryPointTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the point-in-time view of the virtual tape  was
                 replicated for later recovery.

                 The  default timestamp format of the tape recovery point time
                 is in the ISO8601 extended YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS'Z' format.

              TapeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the virtual tapes to recover.

              TapeStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the virtual tapes.

       Marker -> (string)
          An opaque string that indicates the position at  which  the  virtual
          tape recovery points that were listed for description ended.

          Use this marker in your next request to list the next set of virtual
          tape recovery points in the list. If  there  are  no  more  recovery
          points to describe, this field does not appear in the response.
