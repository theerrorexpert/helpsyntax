UPDATE-SMB-FILE-SHARE()                                UPDATE-SMB-FILE-SHARE()



NAME
       update-smb-file-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a Server Message Block (SMB) file share. This operation is only
       supported for S3 File Gateways.

       NOTE:
          To leave a file share field unchanged, set the  corresponding  input
          field to null.

       WARNING:
          File  gateways  require  Security Token Service (Amazon Web Services
          STS) to be activated to enable you to create a file share. Make sure
          that Amazon Web Services STS is activated in the Amazon Web Services
          Region you are creating your file gateway in. If Amazon Web Services
          STS  is  not  activated in this Amazon Web Services Region, activate
          it. For information about how to activate Amazon Web  Services  STS,
          see Activating and deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon
          Web Services Region in the Identity and Access Management User Guide
          .

          File  gateways  don't  support  creating hard or symbolic links on a
          file share.

OPTIONS
       --file-share-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SMB file share that  you  want
          to update.

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own
          KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric  customer  master  key
          (CMK)  used  for  Amazon  S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway
          does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only  be  set  when
          KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

       --default-storage-class (string)
          The  default  storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket
          by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is  S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING
          . Optional.

          Valid  Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STANDARD_IA
          | S3_ONEZONE_IA

       --object-acl (string)
          A value that sets the  access  control  list  (ACL)  permission  for
          objects  in  the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into.
          The default value is private .

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

          o aws-exec-read

       --read-only | --no-read-only (boolean)
          A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set  this  value
          to true to set write status to read-only, otherwise set to false .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --guess-mime-type-enabled | --no-guess-mime-type-enabled (boolean)
          A  value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects
          based on file extensions. Set this value to true to enable MIME type
          guessing, otherwise set to false . The default value is true .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --requester-pays | --no-requester-pays (boolean)
          A  value  that  sets  who  pays the cost of the request and the cost
          associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this  value  is
          set to true , the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket
          owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always  pays  the  cost  of
          storing data.

          NOTE:
              RequesterPays  is  a  configuration for the S3 bucket that backs
              the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the  file
              share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --smbacl-enabled | --no-smbacl-enabled (boolean)
          Set  this  value  to true to enable access control list (ACL) on the
          SMB file share. Set it to false to map file  and  directory  permis-
          sions to the POSIX permissions.

          For  more  information,  see Using Microsoft Windows ACLs to control
          access to an SMB file share in the Storage Gateway User Guide .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --access-based-enumeration | --no-access-based-enumeration (boolean)
          The files and folders on this share will only be  visible  to  users
          with read access.

       --admin-user-list (list)
          A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that have adminis-
          trator rights to the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @
          character.  Acceptable  formats  include:  DOMAIN\User1  ,  user1  ,
          @group1 , and @DOMAIN\group1 . Can only be set if Authentication  is
          set to ActiveDirectory .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --valid-user-list (list)
          A  list  of users or groups in the Active Directory that are allowed
          to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @  char-
          acter.  Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1 , user1 , @group1 ,
          and @DOMAIN\group1 . Can only be set if  Authentication  is  set  to
          ActiveDirectory .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --invalid-user-list (list)
          A  list  of  users  or  groups  in the Active Directory that are not
          allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with  the
          @  character.  Acceptable  formats  include:  DOMAIN\User1 , user1 ,
          @group1 , and @DOMAIN\group1 . Can only be set if Authentication  is
          set to ActiveDirectory .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --audit-destination-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.

       --case-sensitivity (string)
          The  case of an object name in an Amazon S3 bucket. For ClientSpeci-
          fied , the client determines the case sensitivity. For CaseSensitive
          ,  the gateway determines the case sensitivity. The default value is
          ClientSpecified .

          Possible values:

          o ClientSpecified

          o CaseSensitive

       --file-share-name (string)
          The name of the file share. Optional.

          NOTE:
              FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set  in  Loca-
              tionARN , or if an access point or access point alias is used.

       --cache-attributes (structure)
          Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              Refreshes  a file share's cache by using Time To Live (TTL). TTL
              is the length of time since the last refresh after which  access
              to  the  directory would cause the file gateway to first refresh
              that directory's contents from the Amazon S3  bucket  or  Amazon
              FSx file system. The TTL duration is in seconds.

              Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30 days)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds": integer
          }

       --notification-policy (string)
          The  notification  policy  of  the file share. SettlingTimeInSeconds
          controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in  time
          a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notifi-
          cation. Because clients can make many small writes  to  files,  it's
          best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generat-
          ing multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

          NOTE:
              SettlingTimeInSeconds  has no effect on the timing of the object
              uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

          The following example  sets  NotificationPolicy  on  with  Settling-
          TimeInSeconds set to 60.
              {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}

          The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.
              {}

       --oplocks-enabled | --no-oplocks-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies  whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file
          share.

          NOTE:
              Enabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares  is  not
              recommended  for workloads that involve access to files with the
              same name in different case.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FileShareARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the updated SMB file share.
