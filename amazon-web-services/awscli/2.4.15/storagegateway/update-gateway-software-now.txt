UPDATE-GATEWAY-SOFTWARE-NOW()                    UPDATE-GATEWAY-SOFTWARE-NOW()



NAME
       update-gateway-software-now -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the gateway virtual machine (VM) software. The request immedi-
       ately triggers the software update.

       NOTE:
          When you make this request, you get a 200 OK success response  imme-
          diately.  However,  it  might  take some time for the update to com-
          plete. You can call  DescribeGatewayInformation to verify the  gate-
          way is in the STATE_RUNNING state.

       WARNING:
          A  software  update forces a system restart of your gateway. You can
          minimize the chance  of  any  disruption  to  your  applications  by
          increasing  your  iSCSI  Initiators'  timeouts. For more information
          about increasing iSCSI Initiator timeouts for Windows and Linux, see
          Customizing  your  Windows iSCSI settings and Customizing your Linux
          iSCSI settings , respectively.

SYNOPSIS
            update-gateway-software-now
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.
