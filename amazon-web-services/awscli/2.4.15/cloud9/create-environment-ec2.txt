OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the environment to create.

          This  name is visible to other IAM users in the same Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account.

       --description (string)
          The description of the environment to create.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive string that helps  Cloud9  to  ensure  this
          operation completes no more than one time.

          For more information, see Client Tokens in the Amazon EC2 API Refer-
          ence .

       --instance-type (string)
          The type of instance to connect to  the  environment  (for  example,
          t2.micro ).

       --subnet-id (string)
          The  ID of the subnet in Amazon VPC that Cloud9 will use to communi-
          cate with the Amazon EC2 instance.

       --image-id (string)
          The identifier for the Amazon Machine Image  (AMI)  that's  used  to
          create the EC2 instance. To choose an AMI for the instance, you must
          specify a valid AMI alias or a  valid  Amazon  EC2  Systems  Manager
          (SSM) path.

          The default AMI is used if the parameter isn't explicitly assigned a
          value in the request. Because Amazon Linux AMI  has  ended  standard
          support  as  of  December  31,  2020, we recommend you choose Amazon
          Linux 2, which includes long term support through 2023.

       --automatic-stop-time-minutes (integer)
          The  number of minutes until the running instance is shut down after
          the environment has last been used.

       --owner-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment  owner.  This  ARN
          can be the ARN of any IAM principal. If this value is not specified,
          the ARN defaults to this environment's creator.

       --tags (list)
          An array of key-value pairs that will be  associated  with  the  new
          Cloud9 development environment.

          (structure)
              Metadata  that is associated with Amazon Web Services resources.
              In particular, a name-value pair that can be associated with  an
              Cloud9  development  environment.  There  are two types of tags:
              user tags and system tags . A user tag is created by the user. A
              system  tag is automatically created by Amazon Web Services ser-
              vices. A system tag is prefixed with "aws:" and cannot be  modi-
              fied by the user.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name part of a tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value part of a tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --connection-type (string)
          The  connection  type  used for connecting to an Amazon EC2 environ-
          ment. Valid values are CONNECT_SSH (default) and  CONNECT_SSM  (con-
          nected through Amazon EC2 Systems Manager).

          For  more  information,  see Accessing no-ingress EC2 instances with
          Amazon EC2 Systems Manager in the Cloud9 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o CONNECT_SSH

          o CONNECT_SSM

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an AWS Cloud9 EC2 development environment

       This  example  creates  an  AWS Cloud9 development environment with the
       specified settings, launches an Amazon Elastic  Compute  Cloud  (Amazon
       EC2)  instance, and then connects from the instance to the environment.

       Command:

          aws cloud9 create-environment-ec2 --name my-demo-env --description "My demonstration development environment." --instance-type t2.micro --subnet-id subnet-1fab8aEX --automatic-stop-time-minutes 60 --owner-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MyDemoUser

       Output:

          {
            "environmentId": "8a34f51ce1e04a08882f1e811bd706EX"
          }

OUTPUT
       environmentId -> (string)
          The ID of the environment that was created.
