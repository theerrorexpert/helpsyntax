DESCRIPTION
       Changes the settings of an existing Cloud9 development environment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-environment
          --environment-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--managed-credentials-action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          The ID of the environment to change settings.

       --name (string)
          A replacement name for the environment.

       --description (string)
          Any new or replacement description for the environment.

       --managed-credentials-action (string)
          Allows  the  environment owner to turn on or turn off the Amazon Web
          Services managed temporary credentials for an Cloud9 environment  by
          using one of the following values:

          o ENABLE

          o DISABLE

          NOTE:
              Only the environment owner can change the status of managed tem-
              porary credentials. An AccessDeniedException  is  thrown  if  an
              attempt  to turn on or turn off managed temporary credentials is
              made by an account that's not the environment owner.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLE

          o DISABLE

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
