NAME
       describe-solution-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  specific  version  of a solution. For more information on
       solutions, see  CreateSolution .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-solution-version
          --solution-version-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --solution-version-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The time used to train the model. You are billed for the time it
              takes to train a model. This field is visible only after  Amazon

          trainingMode -> (string)
              The scope of training to be performed when creating the solution

              parison  to  the  input solution. Choose UPDATE when you want to
              incrementally update your solution version instead  of  creating
              an entirely new one.

              WARNING:
                 The  UPDATE  option can only be used when you already have an
                 active solution version created from the input solution using
                 the  FULL  option and the input solution was trained with the
                 User-Personalization recipe or the HRNN-Coldstart recipe.

              The status of the solution version.

              A solution version can be in one of the following states:

              ure.

              The  date and time (in Unix time) that this version of the solu-
              tion was created.

          lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
