DELETE-SOLUTION()                                            DELETE-SOLUTION()



NAME
       delete-solution -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  all  versions  of  a  solution and the Solution object itself.
       Before deleting a solution, you must delete all campaigns based on  the
       solution.  To  determine  what  campaigns  are using the solution, call
       ListCampaigns and supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  solu-
       tion.  You  can't delete a solution if an associated SolutionVersion is
       in the CREATE PENDING or IN PROGRESS state.  For  more  information  on
       solutions, see  CreateSolution .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-solution
          --solution-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --solution-arn (string)
          The ARN of the solution to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
