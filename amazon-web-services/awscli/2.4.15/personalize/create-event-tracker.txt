CREATE-EVENT-TRACKER()                                  CREATE-EVENT-TRACKER()



NAME
       create-event-tracker -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an event tracker that you use when adding event data to a spec-
       ified dataset group using the PutEvents API.

       NOTE:
          Only one event tracker can be associated with a dataset  group.  You
          will  get  an  error  if  you call CreateEventTracker using the same
          dataset group as an existing event tracker.

       When you create an event tracker, the response includes a tracking  ID,
       which  you  pass  as  a parameter when you use the PutEvents operation.
       Amazon Personalize then appends the  event  data  to  the  Interactions
       dataset of the dataset group you specify in your event tracker.

       The event tracker can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

       To get the status of the event tracker, call  DescribeEventTracker .

       NOTE:
              The  event  tracker must be in the ACTIVE state before using the
              tracking ID.

SYNOPSIS
            create-event-tracker
          --name <value>
          --dataset-group-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name for the event tracker.

       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset  group  that  receives
          the event data.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       eventTrackerArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the event tracker.

       trackingId -> (string)
          The  ID  of  the  event  tracker. Include this ID in requests to the
          PutEvents API.
