STOP-SOLUTION-VERSION-CREATION()              STOP-SOLUTION-VERSION-CREATION()



NAME
       stop-solution-version-creation -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  creating a solution version that is in a state of CREATE_PENDING
       or CREATE IN_PROGRESS.

       Depending on the current state of the solution  version,  the  solution
       version state changes as follows:

       o CREATE_PENDING > CREATE_STOPPED or

       o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS > CREATE_STOPPING > CREATE_STOPPED

       You  are billed for all of the training completed up until you stop the
       solution version creation. You cannot resume creating a  solution  ver-
       sion once it has been stopped.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-solution-version-creation
          --solution-version-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --solution-version-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version you want to
          stop creating.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
