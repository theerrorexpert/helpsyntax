DESCRIBE-RECIPE()                                            DESCRIBE-RECIPE()



NAME
       describe-recipe -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a recipe.

       A recipe contains three items:

       o An algorithm that trains a model.

       o Hyperparameters that govern the training.

       o Feature  transformation  information  for  modifying  the  input data
         before training.

       Amazon Personalize provides a set of predefined recipes. You specify  a
       recipe  when  you  create a solution with the  CreateSolution API. Cre-
       ateSolution trains a model by using  the  algorithm  in  the  specified
       recipe  and  a  training dataset. The solution, when deployed as a cam-
       paign, can provide recommendations using the GetRecommendations API.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-recipe
          --recipe-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recipe-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recipe to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       recipe -> (structure)
          An object that describes the recipe.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the recipe.

          recipeArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recipe.

          algorithmArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the algorithm that Amazon Per-
              sonalize uses to train the model.

          featureTransformationArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the FeatureTransformation object.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the recipe.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the recipe.

          creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time (in Unix format) that the recipe was created.

          recipeType -> (string)
              One of the following values:

              o PERSONALIZED_RANKING

              o RELATED_ITEMS

              o USER_PERSONALIZATION

          lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time (in Unix format)  that  the  recipe  was  last
              updated.
