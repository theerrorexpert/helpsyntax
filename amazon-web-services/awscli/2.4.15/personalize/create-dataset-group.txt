CREATE-DATASET-GROUP()                                  CREATE-DATASET-GROUP()



NAME
       create-dataset-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an empty dataset group. A dataset group is a container for Ama-
       zon Personalize resources. A dataset group can contain  at  most  three
       datasets, one for each type of dataset:

       o Interactions

       o Items

       o Users

       A  dataset  group  can  be  a Domain dataset group, where you specify a
       domain and use pre-configured resources like recommenders, or a  Custom
       dataset  group, where you use custom resources, such as a solution with
       a solution version, that you deploy with a campaign. If you start  with
       a  Domain  dataset  group,  you  can still add custom resources such as
       solutions and solution versions trained with  recipes  for  custom  use
       cases and deployed with campaigns.

       A dataset group can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o DELETE PENDING

       To get the status of the dataset group, call  DescribeDatasetGroup . If
       the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a  failureRea-
       son key, which describes why the creation failed.

       NOTE:
          You must wait until the status of the dataset group is ACTIVE before
          adding a dataset to the group.

       You can specify an Key Management Service  (KMS)  key  to  encrypt  the
       datasets  in the group. If you specify a KMS key, you must also include
       an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role  that  has  permission  to
       access the key.

SYNOPSIS
            create-dataset-group
          --name <value>
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--kms-key-arn <value>]
          [--domain <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name for the new dataset group.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has
          permissions to access the Key Management Service (KMS) key.  Supply-
          ing an IAM role is only valid when also specifying a KMS key.

       --kms-key-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Key Management Service (KMS) key
          used to encrypt the datasets.

       --domain (string)
          The domain of the dataset group. Specify a domain to create a Domain
          dataset group. The domain you specify determines the default schemas
          for datasets and the use cases available for  recommenders.  If  you
          don't specify a domain, you create a Custom dataset group with solu-
          tion versions that you deploy with a campaign.

          Possible values:

          o ECOMMERCE

          o VIDEO_ON_DEMAND

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       datasetGroupArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the new dataset group.

       domain -> (string)
          The domain for the new Domain dataset group.
