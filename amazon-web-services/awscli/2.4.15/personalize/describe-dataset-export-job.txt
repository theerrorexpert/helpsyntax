NAME
       describe-dataset-export-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  dataset export job created by  CreateDatasetExportJob ,
       including the export job status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-dataset-export-job
          --dataset-export-job-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-export-job-arn (string)
          The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  dataset  export  job  to
          describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The status is one of the following values:

          o CREATE PENDING

              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role that has
              permissions to add data to your output Amazon S3 bucket.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the dataset export job.

              A dataset export job can be in one of the following states:

              o CREATE PENDING >  CREATE  IN_PROGRESS  >  ACTIVE  -or-  CREATE
                FAILED

          jobOutput -> (structure)
              The  path  to  the  Amazon  S3  bucket where the job's output is
              stored. For example:
                 s3://bucket-name/folder-name/

              s3DataDestination -> (structure)
                 The configuration details of an Amazon  S3  input  or  output
                 bucket.

                 path -> (string)
                     The file path of the Amazon S3 bucket.

                 kmsKeyArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Ser-
                     vice (KMS) key that Amazon Personalize uses to encrypt or

          creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The creation date and time (in Unix time) of the dataset  export
              job.

          lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time  (in  Unix  time) the status of the dataset
              export job was last updated.

          failureReason -> (string)
              If a dataset export job fails, provides the reason why.
