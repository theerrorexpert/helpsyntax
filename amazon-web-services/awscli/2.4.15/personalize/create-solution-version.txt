CREATE-SOLUTION-VERSION()                            CREATE-SOLUTION-VERSION()



NAME
       create-solution-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Trains  or  retrains  an  active  solution in a Custom dataset group. A
       solution is created using the  CreateSolution operation and must be  in
       the  ACTIVE  state before calling CreateSolutionVersion . A new version
       of the solution is created every time you call this operation.
          Status

       A solution version can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING

       o CREATE IN_PROGRESS

       o ACTIVE

       o CREATE FAILED

       o CREATE STOPPING

       o CREATE STOPPED

       To get the status of the version, call  DescribeSolutionVersion .  Wait
       until the status shows as ACTIVE before calling CreateCampaign .

       If  the  status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a failur-
       eReason key, which describes why the job failed.

SYNOPSIS
            create-solution-version
          --solution-arn <value>
          [--training-mode <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --solution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution containing the train-
          ing configuration information.

       --training-mode (string)
          The  scope  of  training  to be performed when creating the solution
          version. The FULL option trains the solution version  based  on  the
          entirety  of  the  input  solution's training data, while the UPDATE
          option processes only the data that has changed in comparison to the
          input  solution. Choose UPDATE when you want to incrementally update
          your solution version instead of creating an entirely new one.

          WARNING:
              The UPDATE option can only be used  when  you  already  have  an
              active  solution  version  created from the input solution using
              the FULL option and the input  solution  was  trained  with  the
              User-Personalization recipe or the HRNN-Coldstart recipe.

          Possible values:

          o FULL

          o UPDATE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       solutionVersionArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the new solution version.
