LIST-BATCH-SEGMENT-JOBS()                            LIST-BATCH-SEGMENT-JOBS()



NAME
       list-batch-segment-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the batch segment jobs that have been performed off of a
       solution version that you specify.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-batch-segment-jobs is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: batchSegmentJobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-batch-segment-jobs
          [--solution-version-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --solution-version-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the solution version that the
          batch segment jobs used to generate batch segments.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       batchSegmentJobs -> (list)
          A list containing information on each job that is returned.

          (structure)
              A truncated version of the  BatchSegmentJob datatype. The  List-
              BatchSegmentJobs operation returns a list of batch  segment  job
              summaries.

              batchSegmentJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the batch segment job.

              jobName -> (string)
                 The name of the batch segment job.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the batch segment job. The status is one of the
                 following values:

                 o PENDING

                 o IN PROGRESS

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE FAILED

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the batch segment job was created.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the batch segment job was last updated.

              failureReason -> (string)
                 If the batch segment job failed, the reason for the  failure.

              solutionVersionArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version used
                 by the batch segment job to generate batch segments.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. The value  is
          null when there are no more results to return.
