LIST-TABLES()                                                    LIST-TABLES()



NAME
       list-tables -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  tables in a database. If neither SchemaPattern nor TablePat-
       tern are specified, then all tables in the  database  are  returned.  A
       token  is  returned  to  page  through the table list. Depending on the
       authorization method, use one of the following combinations of  request
       parameters:

       o Secrets  Manager  -  when connecting to a cluster, specify the Amazon
         Resource Name (ARN) of the secret, the database name, and the cluster
         identifier that matches the cluster in the secret. When connecting to
         a serverless endpoint, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the
         secret and the database name.

       o Temporary  credentials  -  when  connecting to a cluster, specify the
         cluster identifier, the database name, and the  database  user  name.
         Also, permission to call the redshift:GetClusterCredentials operation
         is required. When connecting to a serverless  endpoint,  specify  the
         database name.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tables  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Tables

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier. This parameter is required  when  connecting
          to a cluster and authenticating using either Secrets Manager or tem-
          porary credentials.

       --connected-database (string)
          A database name. The connected database is specified when  you  con-
          nect with your authentication credentials.

       --database (string)
          The  name  of the database that contains the tables to list. If Con-
          nectedDatabase is not specified, this is also the database  to  con-
          nect to with your authentication credentials.

       --db-user (string)
          The  database  user name. This parameter is required when connecting
          to a cluster and authenticating using temporary credentials.

       --schema-pattern (string)
          A pattern to filter results by schema name. Within a schema pattern,
          "%"  means match any substring of 0 or more characters and "_" means
          match any one character.  Only  schema  name  entries  matching  the
          search pattern are returned. If SchemaPattern is not specified, then
          all tables that match TablePattern are returned. If neither SchemaP-
          attern  or TablePattern are specified, then all tables are returned.

       --secret-arn (string)
          The name or ARN of the secret that enables access to  the  database.
          This  parameter  is  required when authenticating using Secrets Man-
          ager.

       --table-pattern (string)
          A pattern to filter results by table name. Within a  table  pattern,
          "%"  means match any substring of 0 or more characters and "_" means
          match any one character. Only table name entries matching the search
          pattern  are  returned.  If  TablePattern is not specified, then all
          tables that match SchemaPattern are returned. If neither  SchemaPat-
          tern or TablePattern are specified, then all tables are returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A value that indicates the  starting  point  for  the  next  set  of
          response  records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in
          a response, you can retrieve the next set of  records  by  providing
          this  returned  NextToken  value in the next NextToken parameter and
          retrying the command. If the NextToken field is empty, all  response
          records have been retrieved for the request.

       Tables -> (list)
          The tables that match the request pattern.

          (structure)
              The properties of a table.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the table.

              schema -> (string)
                 The schema containing the table.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of the table. Possible values include TABLE, VIEW,
                 SYSTEM TABLE, GLOBAL TEMPORARY, LOCAL TEMPORARY,  ALIAS,  and
                 SYNONYM.
