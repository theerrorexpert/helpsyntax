GET-STATEMENT-RESULT()                                  GET-STATEMENT-RESULT()



NAME
       get-statement-result -

DESCRIPTION
       Fetches  the  temporarily cached result of an SQL statement. A token is
       returned to page through the statement results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-statement-result is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Records

SYNOPSIS
            get-statement-result
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the SQL statement whose results are to be fetched.
          This value is a universally unique identifier  (UUID)  generated  by
          Amazon  Redshift Data API. A suffix indicates then number of the SQL
          statement. For example, d9b6c0c9-0747-4bf4-b142-e8883122f766:2 has a
          suffix  of  :2  that  indicates  the second SQL statement of a batch
          query. This identifier is returned by  BatchExecuteStatment  ,  Exe-
          cuteStatment , and ListStatements .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ColumnMetadata -> (list)
          The properties (metadata) of a column.

          (structure)
              The properties (metadata) of a column.

              columnDefault -> (string)
                 The default value of the column.

              isCaseSensitive -> (boolean)
                 A  value that indicates whether the column is case-sensitive.

              isCurrency -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether the column  contains  currency
                 values.

              isSigned -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether an integer column is signed.

              label -> (string)
                 The label for the column.

              length -> (integer)
                 The length of the column.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the column.

              nullable -> (integer)
                 A value that indicates whether the column is nullable.

              precision -> (integer)
                 The precision value of a decimal number column.

              scale -> (integer)
                 The scale value of a decimal number column.

              schemaName -> (string)
                 The  name of the schema that contains the table that includes
                 the column.

              tableName -> (string)
                 The name of the table that includes the column.

              typeName -> (string)
                 The database-specific data type of the column.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A value that indicates the  starting  point  for  the  next  set  of
          response  records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in
          a response, you can retrieve the next set of  records  by  providing
          this  returned  NextToken  value in the next NextToken parameter and
          retrying the command. If the NextToken field is empty, all  response
          records have been retrieved for the request.

       Records -> (list)
          The results of the SQL statement.

          (list)
              (structure)
                 A data value in a column.

                     A value of the Boolean data type.

                 doubleValue -> (double)
                     A value of the double data type.

                 isNull -> (boolean)
                     A value that indicates whether the data is NULL.

                 longValue -> (long)
                     A value of the long data type.

                 stringValue -> (string)
                     A value of the string data type.

       TotalNumRows -> (long)
          The  total  number  of rows in the result set returned from a query.
          You can use this number to estimate the number of calls to the  Get-
          StatementResult operation needed to page through the results.
