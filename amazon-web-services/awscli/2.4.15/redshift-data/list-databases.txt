LIST-DATABASES()                                              LIST-DATABASES()



NAME
       list-databases -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  databases  in a cluster. A token is returned to page through
       the database list. Depending on the authorization method,  use  one  of
       the following combinations of request parameters:

       o Secrets  Manager  -  when connecting to a cluster, specify the Amazon
         Resource Name (ARN) of the secret, the database name, and the cluster
         identifier that matches the cluster in the secret. When connecting to
         a serverless endpoint, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the
         secret and the database name.

       o Temporary  credentials  -  when  connecting to a cluster, specify the
         cluster identifier, the database name, and the  database  user  name.
         Also, permission to call the redshift:GetClusterCredentials operation
         is required. When connecting to a serverless  endpoint,  specify  the
         database name.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-databases  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Databases

SYNOPSIS
            list-databases
          [--cluster-identifier <value>]
          --database <value>
          [--db-user <value>]
          [--secret-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier. This parameter is required  when  connecting
          to a cluster and authenticating using either Secrets Manager or tem-
          porary credentials.

       --database (string)
          The name of the database. This parameter is required when  authenti-
          cating using either Secrets Manager or temporary credentials.

       --db-user (string)
          The  database  user name. This parameter is required when connecting
          to a cluster and authenticating using temporary credentials.

       --secret-arn (string)
          The name or ARN of the secret that enables access to  the  database.
          This  parameter  is  required when authenticating using Secrets Man-
          ager.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Databases -> (list)
          The names of databases.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  value  that  indicates  the  starting  point  for the next set of
          response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned  in
          a  response,  you  can retrieve the next set of records by providing
          this returned NextToken value in the next  NextToken  parameter  and
          retrying  the command. If the NextToken field is empty, all response
          records have been retrieved for the request.
