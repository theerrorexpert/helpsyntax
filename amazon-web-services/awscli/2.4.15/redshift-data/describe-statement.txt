NAME
       describe-statement -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the details about a specific instance when a query was run by
       the Amazon Redshift Data API. The information includes when  the  query
       started,  when  it  finished,  the  query  status,  the  number of rows
       returned, and the SQL statement.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-statement
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the SQL statement to describe.  This  value  is  a
          universally  unique  identifier  (UUID) generated by Amazon Redshift
          Data API. A suffix indicates the number of the  SQL  statement.  For
          example,  d9b6c0c9-0747-4bf4-b142-e8883122f766:2  has a suffix of :2
          that indicates the second SQL statement of a batch query. This iden-
          tifier  is returned by BatchExecuteStatment , ExecuteStatement , and
          ListStatements .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The value is true if any substatement returns a result set.

       Id -> (string)
          The identifier of the SQL statement described. This value is a  uni-
          versally  unique identifier (UUID) generated by Amazon Redshift Data
          API.

       QueryParameters -> (list)
          The parameters for the SQL statement.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the parameter. Amazon Redshift  implicitly  con-
                 verts  to the proper data type. For more inforation, see Data
                 types in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide .

          system view.

       ResultRows -> (long)
          Either the number of rows returned from the  SQL  statement  or  the
          number  of  rows  affected. If result size is greater than zero, the
          result rows can be the number of rows  affected  by  SQL  statements
          such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, COPY, and others. A -1 indicates the
          value is null.

       ResultSize -> (long)
          The size in bytes of the returned results. A -1 indicates the  value
          is null.
