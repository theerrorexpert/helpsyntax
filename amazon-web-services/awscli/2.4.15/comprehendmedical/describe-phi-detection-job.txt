DESCRIBE-PHI-DETECTION-JOB()                      DESCRIBE-PHI-DETECTION-JOB()



NAME
       describe-phi-detection-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  properties  associated  with  a protected health information
       (PHI) detection job. Use this operation to get the status of  a  detec-
       tion job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-phi-detection-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  identifier  that Comprehend Medical; generated for the job. The
          StartPHIDetectionJob  operation  returns  this  identifier  in   its
          response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a PHI detection job

       The  following  describe-phi-detection-job example displays the proper-
       ties associated with an asynchronous protected health information (PHI)
       detection job.

          aws comprehendmedical describe-phi-detection-job \
              --job-id "4750034166536cdb52ffa3295a1b00a3"

       Output:

OUTPUT
       ComprehendMedicalAsyncJobProperties -> (structure)
          An object that contains the properties associated with  a  detection
          job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the detection job.

          JobName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned to the detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the detection job. If the status is FAILED
              , the Message field shows the reason for the failure.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of a job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the detection job was submitted for processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the detection job completed.

          ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that job metadata is deleted from the  server.
              Output  files  in  your S3 bucket will not be deleted. After the
              metadata is deleted, the  job  will  no  longer  appear  in  the
              results  of  the ListEntitiesDetectionV2Job or the ListPHIDetec-
              tionJobs operation.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input data configuration that you supplied when you  created
              the detection job.

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 The  URI  of  the S3 bucket that contains the input data. The
                 bucket must be in the same region as the  API  endpoint  that
                 you are calling.

                 Each file in the document collection must be less than 40 KB.
                 You can store a maximum of 30 GB in the bucket.

              S3Key -> (string)
                 The path to the input data files in the S3 bucket.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the detection job.

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 When  you  use  the OutputDataConfig object with asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to  write the output data. The URI must be in the same region
                 as the API endpoint that you are  calling.  The  location  is
                 used as the prefix for the actual location of the output.

              S3Key -> (string)
                 The  path  to the output data files in the S3 bucket. Compre-
                 hend Medical; creates an output directory using the job ID so
                 that the output from one job does not overwrite the output of
                 another.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code of the input documents.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  gives  Comprehend  Medical;
              read access to your input data.

          ManifestFilePath -> (string)
              The  path to the file that describes the results of a batch job.

          KMSKey -> (string)
              The AWS Key Management Service key, if any, used to encrypt  the
              output files.

          ModelVersion -> (string)
              The version of the model used to analyze the documents. The ver-
              sion number looks like X.X.X. You can use  this  information  to
              track the model used for a particular batch of documents.
