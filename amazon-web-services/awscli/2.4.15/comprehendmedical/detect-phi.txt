DETECT-PHI()                                                      DETECT-PHI()



NAME
       detect-phi -

DESCRIPTION
       Inspects the clinical text for protected health information (PHI) enti-
       ties and returns the entity category, location,  and  confidence  score
       for  each  entity.  Amazon  Comprehend Medical only detects entities in
       English language texts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-phi
          --text <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A UTF-8 text string containing the clinical content  being  examined
          for  PHI  entities. Each string must contain fewer than 20,000 bytes
          of characters.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To detect protected health information (PHI)  directly  from
       text

       The following detect-phi example displays the detected protected health
       information (PHI) entities directly from input text.

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          The collection of PHI entities extracted from  the  input  text  and
          their associated information. For each entity, the response provides
          the entity text, the entity category, where the entity  text  begins
          and  ends,  and the level of confidence that Comprehend Medical; has
          in its detection.

          (structure)
              Provides information about an extracted medical entity.

              Id -> (integer)
                 The numeric identifier for the entity. This  is  a  monotoni-
                 cally increasing id unique within this response rather than a
                 global unique identifier.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that  shows
                 where  the  entity  begins. The offset returns the UTF-8 code
                 point in the string.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that  shows
                 where  the  entity  ends.  The  offset returns the UTF-8 code
                 point in the string.

              Score -> (float)
                 The level of confidence that Comprehend Medical; has  in  the
                 accuracy of the detection.

                 The segment of input text extracted as this entity.

              Category -> (string)

                        The level of confidence that Comprehend  Medical;  has
                        in the accuracy of this trait.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 The extracted attributes that relate to this entity.

                 (structure)
                     An  extracted segment of the text that is an attribute of
                     an entity, or otherwise related to an entity, such as the
                     dosage  of  a  medication  taken. It contains information
                     about the attribute such as  id,  begin  and  end  offset
                     within the input text, and the segment of the input text.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of attribute.

                     Score -> (float)
                        The level of confidence that Comprehend  Medical;  has

                        attribute.

                     RelationshipScore -> (float)
                        The level of confidence that Comprehend  Medical;  has
                        that  this  attribute  is  correctly  related  to this
                        entity.

                        The  type  of  relationship  between  the  entity  and
                        attribute.  Type  for  the  relationship  is OVERLAP ,
                        indicating that the entity occurred at the  same  time
                        as the Date_Expression .

                     Id -> (integer)
                        The  numeric  identifier for this attribute. This is a

                        response rather than a global unique identifier.

                     BeginOffset -> (integer)
                        The  0-based  character  offset in the input text that
                        shows where the attribute begins. The  offset  returns
                        the UTF-8 code point in the string.

                     EndOffset -> (integer)
                        The  0-based  character  offset in the input text that
                        shows where the attribute ends. The offset returns the
                        UTF-8 code point in the string.

                     Text -> (string)
                        The segment of input text extracted as this attribute.

                     Category -> (string)

                               The level of confidence that  Comprehend  Medi-
                               cal; has in the accuracy of this trait.

          include the PaginationToken to fetch the next page of PHI  entities.
