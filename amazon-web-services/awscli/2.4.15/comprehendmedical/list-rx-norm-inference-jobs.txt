DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of InferRxNorm jobs that you have submitted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-rx-norm-inference-jobs
          [--filter <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters  the  jobs  that  are returned. You can filter jobs based on
          their names, status, or the date and time that they were  submitted.
          You can only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters on the name of the job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters  the list of jobs based on job status. Returns only jobs
              with the specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Returns only jobs submitted before the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest  to
              newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Returns only  jobs  submitted  after  the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"PARTIAL_SUCCESS"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.

       --max-results (integer)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ComprehendMedicalAsyncJobPropertiesList -> (list)
          The maximum number of results to return in each page. The default is
          100.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a detection job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The identifier assigned to the detection job.

              JobName -> (string)
                 The name that you assigned to the detection job.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The  current  status  of  the detection job. If the status is
                 FAILED , the Message field shows the reason for the  failure.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the status of a job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the detection job was submitted for processing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the detection job completed.

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that  job  metadata  is  deleted  from  the
                 server.  Output  files in your S3 bucket will not be deleted.
                 After the metadata is deleted, the job will no longer  appear
                 in the results of the ListEntitiesDetectionV2Job or the List-
                 PHIDetectionJobs operation.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input data configuration that you supplied when you  cre-
                 ated the detection job.

                 S3Bucket -> (string)
                     The  URI  of  the S3 bucket that contains the input data.
                     The bucket must be in the same region as the API endpoint
                     that you are calling.

                     Each file in the document collection must be less than 40
                     KB. You can store a maximum of 30 GB in the bucket.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The path to the input data files in the S3 bucket.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the detection job.

                 S3Bucket -> (string)
                     When  you  use the OutputDataConfig object with asynchro-
                     nous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where
                     you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     location is used as the prefix for the actual location of
                     the output.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The path to the output data files in the S3 bucket.  Com-
                     prehend  Medical;  creates  an output directory using the
                     job ID so that the output from one job does not overwrite
                     the output of another.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code of the input documents.

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that gives Comprehend Medical;

                 the output files.

              ModelVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the model used to analyze the  documents.  The
                 version number looks like X.X.X. You can use this information
                 to track the model used for a particular batch of  documents.
