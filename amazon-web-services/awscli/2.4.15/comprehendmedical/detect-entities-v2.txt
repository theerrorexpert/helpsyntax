DETECT-ENTITIES-V2()                                      DETECT-ENTITIES-V2()



NAME
       detect-entities-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Inspects  the  clinical  text  for  a  variety  of medical entities and
       returns specific information about them such as entity category,  loca-
       tion, and confidence score on that information. Amazon Comprehend Medi-
       cal only detects medical entities in English language texts.

       The DetectEntitiesV2 operation replaces the  DetectEntities  operation.
       This  new action uses a different model for determining the entities in
       your medical text and changes the way that some entities  are  returned
       in the output. You should use the DetectEntitiesV2 operation in all new
       applications.

       The DetectEntitiesV2 operation returns the Acuity and  Direction  enti-
       ties as attributes instead of types.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-entities-v2
          --text <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A  UTF-8  string  containing the clinical content being examined for
          entities. Each string must contain fewer than 20,000 bytes of  char-
          acters.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To detect entities directly from text

       The  following  detect-entities-v2  example shows the detected entities
       and labels them according to type, directly from input text.

          aws comprehendmedical detect-entities-v2 \
              --text "Sleeping trouble on present dosage of Clonidine. Severe rash on face and leg, slightly itchy."

       Output:

          {
              "Id": 0,
              "BeginOffset": 38,
              "EndOffset": 47,
              "Score": 0.9942955374717712,
              "Text": "Clonidine",
              "Category": "MEDICATION",
              "Type": "GENERIC_NAME",
              "Traits": []
          },

       Example 2: To detect entities from a file path

       The  following  detect-entities-v2  example shows the detected entities
       and labels them according to type from a file path.

          aws comprehendmedical detect-entities-v2 \
              --text file://medical_entities.txt

              "Sleeping trouble on present dosage of Clonidine. Severe rash on face and leg, slightly itchy."
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Id": 0,
              "BeginOffset": 38,
              "EndOffset": 47,

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          The collection of medical entities extracted from the input text and
          their associated information. For each entity, the response provides
          the  entity  text, the entity category, where the entity text begins
          and ends, and the level of confidence in the detection and analysis.
          Attributes and traits of the entity are also returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about an extracted medical entity.

              Id -> (integer)
                 The  numeric  identifier  for the entity. This is a monotoni-
                 cally increasing id unique within this response rather than a
                 global unique identifier.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 The  0-based  character  offset  in the input text that shows
                 where the entity begins. The offset returns  the  UTF-8  code
                 point in the string.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The  0-based  character  offset  in the input text that shows
                 where the entity ends. The  offset  returns  the  UTF-8  code
                 point in the string.

              Score -> (float)
                 The  level  of confidence that Comprehend Medical; has in the
                 accuracy of the detection.

              Text -> (string)
                 The segment of input text extracted as this entity.

              Category -> (string)

                     an entity, or otherwise related to an entity, such as the
                     dosage of a medication  taken.  It  contains  information
                     about  the  attribute  such  as  id, begin and end offset
