OPTIONS
       --input-data-config (structure)
          The  input  properties  for an entities detection job. This includes
          the name of the S3 bucket and the path to the files to be  analyzed.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The  URI  of  the  S3  bucket  that contains the input data. The
              bucket must be in the same region as the API endpoint  that  you
              are calling.

              Each  file  in  the document collection must be less than 40 KB.
              You can store a maximum of 30 GB in the bucket.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The path to the input data files in the S3 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string"
          }

       --output-data-config (structure)
          The output properties for a detection job.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              When you use the OutputDataConfig object with asynchronous oper-
              ations,  you  specify  the  Amazon S3 location where you want to
              write the output data. The URI must be in the same region as the
              API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is used as the
              prefix for the actual location of the output.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The path to the output data files in the S3  bucket.  Comprehend
              Medical;  creates  an  output directory using the job ID so that
              the output from  one  job  does  not  overwrite  the  output  of
              another.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string"
          }

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Man-
          agement (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend Medical read access
          to your input data.

       --job-name (string)
          The user generated name the asynchronous InferSNOMEDCT job.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the request. If you don't set the client
          request token, Amazon Comprehend Medical generates one.

       --kms-key (string)
          An AWS Key Management Service key used to encrypt your output files.
          If you do not specify a key, the files are written in plain text.

       --language-code (string)
          The  language  of  the input documents. All documents must be in the
          same language.

          Possible values:

          o en

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The identifier generated for the job. To get the status  of  a  job,
          use this identifier with the StartSNOMEDCTInferenceJob operation.
