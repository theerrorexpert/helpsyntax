NAME
       infer-snomedct -

DESCRIPTION
       InferSNOMEDCT  detects  possible medical concepts as entities and links
       them to codes from the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine,  Clinical
       Terms (SNOMED-CT) ontology

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            infer-snomedct
          --text <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          The  input  text to be analyzed using InferSNOMEDCT. The text should
          be a string with 1 to 10000 characters.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          The collection of medical concept entities extracted from the  input
          text and their associated information. For each entity, the response
          provides the entity text, the entity category, where the entity text
          begins and ends, and the level of confidence that Comprehend Medical
          has in the detection and analysis.  Attributes  and  traits  of  the
          entity are also returned.

          (structure)
              The collection of medical entities extracted from the input text
              and their associated information. For each entity, the  response
              provides  the entity text, the entity category, where the entity
              text begins and ends, and the level of confidence  that  Compre-
              hend  Medical  has in the detection and analysis. Attributes and
              traits of the entity are also returned.

              Id -> (integer)
                 The numeric identifier for the entity. This  is  a  monotoni-
                 cally increasing id unique within this response rather than a
                 global unique identifier.

              Text -> (string)
                 The segment of input text extracted as this entity.

              Category -> (string)
                 The category of the detected entity. Possible categories  are
                 MEDICAL_CONDITION, ANATOMY, or TEST_TREATMENT_PROCEDURE.

              Type -> (string)
                 Describes  the specific type of entity with category of enti-
                 ties. Possible types include DX_NAME, ACUITY, DIRECTION, SYS-
                 TEM_ORGAN_SITE,   TEST_NAME,  TEST_VALUE,  TEST_UNIT,  PROCE-
                 DURE_NAME, or TREATMENT_NAME.

              Score -> (float)
                 The level of confidence that Comprehend Medical  has  in  the
                 accuracy of the detected entity.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 The  0-based  character  offset  in the input text that shows
                 where the entity begins. The offset returns  the  UTF-8  code
                 point in the string.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The  0-based  character  offset  in the input text that shows
                 where the entity ends. The  offset  returns  the  UTF-8  code
                 point in the string.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 An  extracted  segment of the text that is an attribute of an
                 entity, or otherwise related to an entity, such as the dosage
                 of a medication taken.

                 (structure)
                     The  extracted  attributes  that  relate to an entity. An
                     extracted segment of the text that is an attribute of  an
                     entity,  or  otherwise  related to an entity, such as the
                     dosage of a medication taken.

                     Category -> (string)

                        TEST_TREATMENT_PROCEDURE.

                     Type -> (string)
