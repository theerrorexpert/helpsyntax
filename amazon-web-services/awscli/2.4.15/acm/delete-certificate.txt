DELETE-CERTIFICATE()                                      DELETE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       delete-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  certificate  and its associated private key. If this action
       succeeds, the certificate no longer appears in the  list  that  can  be
       displayed  by  calling  the  ListCertificates action or be retrieved by
       calling the  GetCertificate action. The certificate will not be  avail-
       able for use by Amazon Web Services services integrated with ACM.

       NOTE:
          You  cannot  delete an ACM certificate that is being used by another
          Amazon Web Services service. To delete a certificate that is in use,
          the certificate association must first be removed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-certificate
          --certificate-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          String  that  contains the ARN of the ACM certificate to be deleted.
          This must be of the form:
              arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certifi-
              cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          For  more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
