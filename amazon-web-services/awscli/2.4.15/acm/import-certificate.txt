IMPORT-CERTIFICATE()                                      IMPORT-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       import-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  a  certificate  into  Amazon  Web Services Certificate Manager
       (ACM) to use with services that are  integrated  with  ACM.  Note  that
       integrated  services allow only certificate types and keys they support
       to be associated with their resources. Further, their  support  differs
       depending  on whether the certificate is imported into IAM or into ACM.
       For more information, see the documentation for each service. For  more
       information  about  importing certificates into ACM, see Importing Cer-
       tificates in the Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager User Guide .

       NOTE:
          ACM does not provide  managed  renewal  for  certificates  that  you
          import.

       Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:

       o You  must  enter the private key that matches the certificate you are
         importing.

       o The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private  key
         that is protected by a password or a passphrase.

       o The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5,120 bytes).

       o If  the  certificate  you  are importing is not self-signed, you must
         enter its certificate chain.

       o If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of
         one of the certificates in the chain.

       o The   certificate,   private  key,  and  certificate  chain  must  be
         PEM-encoded.

       o The current time must be between the Not Before and  Not  After  cer-
         tificate fields.

       o The Issuer field must not be empty.

       o The  OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.

       o To import  a  new  certificate,  omit  the  CertificateArn  argument.
         Include  this  argument  only  when  you want to replace a previously
         imported certificate.

       o When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify  the
         certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file
         names preceded by fileb:// . For example, you can specify a  certifi-
         cate   saved   in  the  C:\temp  folder  as  fileb://C:\temp\certifi-
         cate_to_import.pem . If  you  are  making  an  HTTP  or  HTTPS  Query
         request, include these arguments as BLOBs.

       o When  you  import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the
         certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in  the
         manner required by the programming language you're using.

       o The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the
         algorithm of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key  type
         is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA.

       This  operation  returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the imported
       certificate.

SYNOPSIS
            import-certificate
          [--certificate-arn <value>]
          --certificate <value>
          --private-key <value>
          [--certificate-chain <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  an  imported  certificate  to
          replace. To import a new certificate, omit this field.

       --certificate (blob)
          The certificate to import.

       --private-key (blob)
          The private key that matches the public key in the certificate.

       --certificate-chain (blob)
          The PEM encoded certificate chain.

       --tags (list)
          One  or  more  resource tags to associate with the imported certifi-
          cate.

          Note: You cannot apply tags when reimporting a certificate.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that identifies or specifies metadata about  an
              ACM resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CertificateArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the imported certificate.
