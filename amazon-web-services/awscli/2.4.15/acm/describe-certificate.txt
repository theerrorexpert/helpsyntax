DESCRIBE-CERTIFICATE()                                  DESCRIBE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       describe-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed metadata about the specified ACM certificate.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-certificate
          --certificate-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. The ARN must
          have the following form:
              arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certifi-
              cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          For  more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the fields contained in an ACM certificate

       The following describe-certificate command retrieves all of the  fields
       for the certificate with the specified ARN:

          aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       Output similar to the following is displayed:

              This  field  exists  only  when  the  certificate  type  is AMA-
              ZON_ISSUED .

              value exists only when the certificate type is IMPORTED .

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the certificate.

          RevokedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the certificate was revoked. This value exists
              only when the certificate status is REVOKED .

          RevocationReason -> (string)
              The reason the certificate was revoked. This value  exists  only
              when the certificate status is REVOKED .

              (string)

          FailureReason -> (string)
              The reason the certificate request  failed.  This  value  exists
              only  when  the certificate status is FAILED . For more informa-
              tion, see Certificate Request Failed in the Amazon Web  Services
              Certificate Manager User Guide .

          Type -> (string)
              The source of the certificate. For certificates provided by ACM,
              this value is AMAZON_ISSUED . For certificates that you imported
              with   ImportCertificate , this value is IMPORTED . ACM does not
              provide managed renewal  for  imported  certificates.  For  more
              information  about the differences between certificates that you
              import and those that ACM provides, see  Importing  Certificates

                 in the certificate, as it pertains to ACM's managed renewal .
                 This  is different from the initial validation that occurs as
                 a result  of  the   RequestCertificate  request.  This  field
                 exists only when the certificate type is AMAZON_ISSUED .

                 (structure)
                     Contains  information about the validation of each domain
                     name in the certificate.

                     DomainName -> (string)
                        A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in  the  certifi-

                        tion emails.

                     ValidationStatus -> (string)
                        The  validation status of the domain name. This can be
                        one of the following values:

                        o PENDING_VALIDATION

                        include  the  name of your domain. If you include your
                        domain name in the DNS database CNAME record,  valida-
                        tion    fails.   For   example,   if   the   name   is
                        "_a79865eb4cd1a6ab990a45779b4e0b96.yourdomain.com",
                        only "_a79865eb4cd1a6ab990a45779b4e0b96" must be used.

          KeyUsages -> (list)
              A list of Key Usage X.509 v3 extension objects. Each object is a
              string value that identifies the purpose of the public key  con-
              tained  in  the  certificate.  Possible extension values include
              DIGITAL_SIGNATURE, KEY_ENCHIPHERMENT, NON_REPUDIATION, and more.

              (structure)
                 The  Key  Usage X.509 v3 extension defines the purpose of the
                 public key contained in the certificate.

                 Name -> (string)

              identifier (OID).

              (structure)
                 The Extended Key Usage X.509 v3 extension defines one or more
                 purposes  for  which  the  public key can be used. This is in
                 addition to or in place of the basic  purposes  specified  by
                 the Key Usage extension.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of an Extended Key Usage value.

                 OID -> (string)
                     An  object identifier (OID) for the extension value. OIDs
                     are strings of numbers separated by periods. The  follow-
                     ing OIDs are defined in RFC 3280 and RFC 5280.

              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM PCA private certifi-
              cate authority (CA) that issued the certificate.  This  has  the
              following format:
                 arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-author-
                 ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          RenewalEligibility -> (string)

              issued. A browser might respond to certificate that has not been
              logged by showing an error message. The logs  are  cryptographi-
              cally secure.

                 You can opt out of certificate transparency logging by speci-
                 fying the DISABLED option. Opt in by specifying ENABLED .
