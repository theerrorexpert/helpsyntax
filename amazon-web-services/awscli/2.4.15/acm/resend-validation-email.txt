RESEND-VALIDATION-EMAIL()                            RESEND-VALIDATION-EMAIL()



NAME
       resend-validation-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Resends the email that requests domain ownership validation. The domain
       owner or an authorized representative must approve the ACM  certificate
       before  it can be issued. The certificate can be approved by clicking a
       link in the mail to navigate to the Amazon certificate approval website
       and  then  clicking  I  Approve  . However, the validation email can be
       blocked by spam filters. Therefore, if you do not receive the  original
       mail,  you  can  request  that  the  mail  be resent within 72 hours of
       requesting the ACM certificate. If more  than  72  hours  have  elapsed
       since  your original request or since your last attempt to resend vali-
       dation mail, you must request a new certificate. For  more  information
       about  setting up your contact email addresses, see Configure Email for
       your Domain .

SYNOPSIS
            resend-validation-email
          --certificate-arn <value>
          --domain <value>
          --validation-domain <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          String that contains the ARN of the requested certificate. The  cer-
          tificate  ARN  is  generated and returned by the  RequestCertificate
          action as soon as the request is made. By default, using this param-
          eter  causes email to be sent to all top-level domains you specified
          in the certificate request. The ARN must be of the form:
              arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certifi-
              cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       --domain (string)
          The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the certificate that needs
          to be validated.

       --validation-domain (string)
          The base validation domain that will act as the suffix of the  email
          addresses that are used to send the emails. This must be the same as
          the Domain value or a superdomain of the Domain value. For  example,
          if  you  requested  a certificate for site.subdomain.example.com and
          specify a ValidationDomain  of  subdomain.example.com  ,  ACM  sends
          email  to  the domain registrant, technical contact, and administra-
          tive contact in WHOIS and the following five addresses:

          o admin@subdomain.example.com

          o administrator@subdomain.example.com

          o hostmaster@subdomain.example.com

          o postmaster@subdomain.example.com

          o webmaster@subdomain.example.com

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To resend validation email for your ACM certificate request

       The following resend-validation-email command tells the Amazon certifi-
       cate authority to send validation email to the appropriate addresses:

          aws acm resend-validation-email --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 --domain www.example.com --validation-domain example.com

OUTPUT
       None
