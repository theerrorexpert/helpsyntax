READ-PRESET()                                                    READ-PRESET()



NAME
       read-preset -

DESCRIPTION
       The ReadPreset operation gets detailed information about a preset.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            read-preset
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  preset  for which you want to get detailed
          information.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Preset -> (structure)
          A section of the response body that provides information  about  the
          preset.

          Id -> (string)
              Identifier  for  the  new preset. You use this value to get set-
              tings for the preset or to delete it.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the preset.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the preset.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the preset.

          Container -> (string)
              The container type for the output  file.  Valid  values  include
              flac , flv , fmp4 , gif , mp3 , mp4 , mpg , mxf , oga , ogg , ts
              , and webm .

          Audio -> (structure)
              A section of the response body that provides  information  about
              the audio preset values.

              Codec -> (string)
                 The audio codec for the output file. Valid values include aac
                 , flac , mp2 , mp3 , pcm , and vorbis .

              SampleRate -> (string)
                 The sample rate of the audio stream in the  output  file,  in
                 Hertz. Valid values include:
                     auto , 22050 , 32000 , 44100 , 48000 , 96000

                 If  you  specify  auto  ,  Elastic  Transcoder  automatically
                 detects the sample rate.

              BitRate -> (string)
                 The bit rate of the audio stream in the output file, in kilo-
                 bits/second.  Enter an integer between 64 and 320, inclusive.

              Channels -> (string)
                 The number of audio channels in the output file. The  follow-
                 ing values are valid:
                     auto , 0 , 1 , 2

                 One  channel  carries  the  information  played  by  a single
                 speaker. For example, a stereo track with two channels  sends
                 one channel to the left speaker, and the other channel to the
                 right speaker. The output channels are organized into tracks.
                 If  you  want  Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect the
                 number of audio channels in the input file and use that value
                 for the output file, select auto .

                 The output of a specific channel value and inputs are as fol-
                 lows:

                 o auto  channel specified, with any input: Pass through up to
                   eight input channels.

                 o 0   channels  specified, with any input: Audio omitted from
                   the output.

                 o 1  channel specified, with at least one input channel: Mono
                   sound.

                 o 2   channels  specified, with any input: Two identical mono
                   channels or stereo. For more information about tracks,  see
                   Audio:AudioPackingMode.

                 For  more  information about how Elastic Transcoder organizes
                 channels and tracks, see Audio:AudioPackingMode .

              AudioPackingMode -> (string)
                 The method of  organizing  audio  channels  and  tracks.  Use
                 Audio:Channels to specify the number of channels in your out-
                 put, and Audio:AudioPackingMode  to  specify  the  number  of
                 tracks  and  their  relation  to  the channels. If you do not
                 specify an Audio:AudioPackingMode , Elastic  Transcoder  uses
                 SingleTrack .

                 The following values are valid:
                     SingleTrack  ,  OneChannelPerTrack  ,  and OneChannelPer-
                     TrackWithMosTo8Tracks

                 When you specify SingleTrack , Elastic Transcoder  creates  a
                 single  track for your output. The track can have up to eight
                 channels. Use SingleTrack for all non-mxf containers.

                 The outputs of SingleTrack for a specific channel  value  and
                 inputs are as follows:

                 o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output

                 o 1,  2, or auto  channels with no audio input: Audio omitted
                   from the output

                 o 1  channel with any input with audio: One  track  with  one
                   channel, downmixed if necessary

                 o 2  channels with one track with one channel: One track with
                   two identical channels

                 o 2 or auto  channels with two tracks with one channel  each:
                   One track with two channels

                 o 2  or  auto  channels with one track with two channels: One
                   track with two channels

                 o 2  channels with one  track  with  multiple  channels:  One
                   track with two channels

                 o auto   channels  with one track with one channel: One track
                   with one channel

                 o auto  channels with one track with multiple  channels:  One
                   track with multiple channels

                 When you specify OneChannelPerTrack , Elastic Transcoder cre-
                 ates a new track for every channel in your output. Your  out-
                 put can have up to eight single-channel tracks.

                 The  outputs  of  OneChannelPerTrack  for  a specific channel
                 value and inputs are as follows:

                 o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output

                 o 1, 2, or auto  channels with no audio input: Audio  omitted
                   from the output

                 o 1   channel  with  any input with audio: One track with one
                   channel, downmixed if necessary

                 o 2  channels with one track with  one  channel:  Two  tracks
                   with one identical channel each

                 o 2  or auto  channels with two tracks with one channel each:
                   Two tracks with one channel each

                 o 2 or auto  channels with one track with two  channels:  Two
                   tracks with one channel each

                 o 2   channels  with  one  track  with multiple channels: Two
                   tracks with one channel each

                 o auto  channels with one track with one channel:  One  track
                   with one channel

                 o auto  channels with one track with multiple channels: Up to
                   eight tracks with one channel each

                 When you specify OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks , Elastic
                 Transcoder  creates eight single-channel tracks for your out-
                 put. All tracks that do not contain audio data from an  input
                 channel are MOS, or Mit Out Sound, tracks.

                 The  outputs of OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks for a spe-
                 cific channel value and inputs are as follows:

                 o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output

                 o 1, 2, or auto  channels with no audio input: Audio  omitted
                   from the output

                 o 1   channel  with  any input with audio: One track with one
                   channel, downmixed if necessary, plus six MOS tracks

                 o 2  channels with one track with  one  channel:  Two  tracks
                   with one identical channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                 o 2  or auto  channels with two tracks with one channel each:
                   Two tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                 o 2 or auto  channels with one track with two  channels:  Two
                   tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                 o 2   channels  with  one  track  with multiple channels: Two
                   tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                 o auto  channels with one track with one channel:  One  track
                   with one channel, plus seven MOS tracks

                 o auto  channels with one track with multiple channels: Up to
                   eight tracks with one channel each, plus MOS  tracks  until
                   there are eight tracks in all

              CodecOptions -> (structure)
                 If  you  specified AAC for Audio:Codec , this is the AAC com-
                 pression profile to use. Valid values include:
                     auto , AAC-LC , HE-AAC , HE-AACv2

                 If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder  chooses  a  profile
                 based on the bit rate of the output file.

                 Profile -> (string)
                     You can only choose an audio profile when you specify AAC
                     for the value of Audio:Codec.

                     Specify the AAC profile  for  the  output  file.  Elastic
                     Transcoder supports the following profiles:

                     o auto : If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder selects
                       the profile based on the bit rate selected for the out-
                       put file.

                     o AAC-LC : The most common AAC profile. Use for bit rates
                       larger than 64 kbps.

                     o HE-AAC :  Not  supported  on  some  older  players  and
                       devices. Use for bit rates between 40 and 80 kbps.

                     o HE-AACv2  :  Not supported on some players and devices.
                       Use for bit rates less than 48 kbps.

                     All outputs in a Smooth playlist must have the same value
                     for Profile .

                     NOTE:
                        If  you  created  any presets before AAC profiles were
                        added, Elastic Transcoder automatically  updated  your
                        presets  to  use  AAC-LC.  You can change the value as
                        required.

                 BitDepth -> (string)
                     You can only choose an audio bit depth when  you  specify
                     flac or pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                     The bit depth of a sample is how many bits of information
                     are included in the audio samples.  The  higher  the  bit
                     depth, the better the audio, but the larger the file.

                     Valid values are 16 and 24 .

                     The most common bit depth is 24 .

                 BitOrder -> (string)
                     You  can  only choose an audio bit order when you specify
                     pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                     The order the bits of a PCM sample are stored in.

                     The supported value is LittleEndian .

                 Signed -> (string)
                     You can only choose whether an  audio  sample  is  signed
                     when you specify pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                     Whether  audio  samples are represented with negative and
                     positive  numbers  (signed)  or  only  positive   numbers
                     (unsigned).

                     The supported value is Signed .

          Video -> (structure)
              A  section  of the response body that provides information about
              the video preset values.

              Codec -> (string)
                 The video codec for the output file. Valid values include gif
                 ,  H.264  ,  mpeg2 , vp8 , and vp9 . You can only specify vp8
                 and vp9 when the container type is webm , gif when  the  con-
                 tainer type is gif , and mpeg2 when the container type is mpg
                 .

              CodecOptions -> (map)
                     Profile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)

                 The H.264 profile that you want to use for the  output  file.
                 Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:

                 o baseline  : The profile most commonly used for videoconfer-
                   encing and for mobile applications.

                 o main : The profile used for standard-definition digital  TV
                   broadcasts.

                 o high  :  The  profile  used  for high-definition digital TV
                   broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.
                     Level (H.264 Only)

                 The H.264 level that you want to use  for  the  output  file.
                 Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:
                     1  , 1b , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 2 , 2.1 , 2.2 , 3 , 3.1 , 3.2
                     , 4 , 4.1

                     MaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)

                 Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is  H.264.  The
                 maximum  number of previously decoded frames to use as a ref-
                 erence for decoding future frames. Valid values are  integers
                 0  through  16,  but  we  recommend  that you not use a value
                 greater than the following:
                     Min(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks *
                     256 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)

                 where  Width  in pixels and Height in pixels represent either
                 MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum  decoded  pic-
                 ture  buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the Level
                 object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of  pix-
                 els measuring 16x16.)

                 o 1 - 396

                 o 1b - 396

                 o 1.1 - 900

                 o 1.2 - 2376

                 o 1.3 - 2376

                 o 2 - 2376

                 o 2.1 - 4752

                 o 2.2 - 8100

                 o 3 - 8100

                 o 3.1 - 18000

                 o 3.2 - 20480

                 o 4 - 32768

                 o 4.1 - 32768
                     MaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)

                 The  maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the
                 size of the buffer is specified by  BufferSize  .  Specify  a
                 value  between  16  and  62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth
                 required to stream a video by reducing the maximum bit  rate,
                 but this also reduces the quality of the video.
                     BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)

                 The  maximum  number  of  bits in any x seconds of the output
                 video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard  seg-
                 ment  duration when you're using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the con-
                 tainer type of the output video. Specify an  integer  greater
                 than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize , Elas-
                 tic Transcoder sets BufferSize  to  10  times  the  value  of
                 MaxBitRate .
                     InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)

                 The interlace mode for the output video.

                 Interlaced  video  is used to double the perceived frame rate
                 for a video by interlacing two fields  (one  field  on  every
                 other  line,  the other field on the other lines) so that the
                 human eye registers multiple pictures per frame.  Interlacing
                 reduces  the bandwidth required for transmitting a video, but
                 can result in blurred images and flickering.

                 Valid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bot-
                 tom),  TopFirst  (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom field
                 first), and Auto .

                 If InterlaceMode is not specified,  Elastic  Transcoder  uses
                 Progressive  for  the  output.  If Auto is specified, Elastic
                 Transcoder interlaces the output.
                     ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)

                 The color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to  the
                 output  video.  Color  spaces  are the algorithms used by the
                 computer to store information  about  how  to  render  color.
                 Bt.601  is  the standard for standard definition video, while
                 Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video.

                 Valid values include None , Bt709toBt601 , Bt601toBt709 , and
                 Auto .

                 If  you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your out-
                 put is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97 , 24 ,  25
                 ,  29.97 , 50 , or 60 , your SegmentDuration is null, and you
                 are using one of the resolution changes from the list  below,
                 Elastic  Transcoder applies the following color space conver-
                 sions:

                 o Standard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 -  Elastic  Transcoder
                   applies Bt601ToBt709

                 o Standard  to  HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder
                   applies Bt601ToBt709

                 o HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 -  Elastic  Transcoder
                   applies Bt709ToBt601

                 o HD  to  Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 - Elastic Transcoder
                   applies Bt709ToBt601

                 NOTE:
                     Elastic Transcoder may change the behavior  of  the  Col-
                     orspaceConversionMode   Auto mode in the future. All out-
                     puts in a playlist must use  the  same  ColorSpaceConver-
                     sionMode .

                 If  you  do  not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode , Elastic
                 Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If  you
                 are  unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to your
                 output file, you can  check  the  AppliedColorSpaceConversion
                 parameter included in your job response. If your job does not
                 have an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no  Col-
                 orSpaceConversionMode was applied.
                     ChromaSubsampling

                 The  sampling  pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the
                 output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p .
                     yuv420p samples the chroma  information  of  every  other
                     horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples
                     the color information of every horizontal line and  every
                     other vertical line.

                     LoopCount (Gif Only)

                 The  number  of  times you want the output gif to loop. Valid
                 values include Infinite and integers  between  0  and  100  ,
                 inclusive.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              KeyframesMaxDist -> (string)
                 Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264
                 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .

                 The maximum number of frames between key frames.  Key  frames
                 are  fully  encoded frames; the frames between key frames are
                 encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The
                 value  is  an integer formatted as a string; valid values are
                 between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive.
                 A  higher  value  results  in higher compression but may also
                 discernibly decrease video quality.

                 For Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant  ratio
                 to  the  KeyframesMaxDist  .  This allows Smooth playlists to
                 switch between different quality levels  while  the  file  is
                 being played.

                 For  example, an input file can have a FrameRate of 30 with a
                 KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs to have  a
                 ratio  of  1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameRate of 30, 25,
                 and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively.

                 Alternately,  this  can  be  achieved by setting FrameRate to
                 auto  and  having  the  same  values  for  MaxFrameRate   and
                 KeyframesMaxDist .

              FixedGOP -> (string)
                 Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264
                 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .

                 Whether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP . Valid values  are
                 true and false :

                 o true  :  Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the value of Keyframes-
                   MaxDist for the distance between key frames (the number  of
                   frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).

                 o false : The distance between key frames can vary.

                 WARNING:
                     FixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.

              BitRate -> (string)
                 The bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in kilo-
                 bits/second. Valid values depend on the values of  Level  and
                 Profile  .  If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the
                 detected bit rate of the input source. If you specify a value
                 other  than auto , we recommend that you specify a value less
                 than or equal to the maximum H.264-compliant value listed for
                 your level and profile:
                     Level  - Maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (base-
                     line and main Profile) : maximum video bit rate in  kilo-
                     bits/second (high Profile)

                 o 1.1 - 192 : 240

                 o 1.2 - 384 : 480

                 o 1.3 - 768 : 960

                 o 2 - 2000 : 2500

                 o 4 - 20000 : 25000

                 o 4.1 - 50000 : 62500

              FrameRate -> (string)
                 The  frames  per  second  for  the video stream in the output
                 file. Valid values include:
                     auto , 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

                 If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder  uses  the  detected
                 frame  rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate,
                 we recommend that you perform the following calculation:
                     Frame rate = maximum recommended decoding speed  in  luma
                     samples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)

                 where:

                 o width  in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolu-
                   tion of the output video.

                 o maximum recommended decoding speed in  Luma  samples/second
                   is  less  than  or equal to the maximum value listed in the
                   following table, based on the value that you specified  for
                   Level.

                 The maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second
                 for each level is described in the following  list  (Level  -
                 Decoding speed ):

                 o 1 - 380160

                 o 1b - 380160

                 o 1.1 - 76800

                 o 1.2 - 1536000

                 o 1.3 - 3041280

                 o 2 - 3041280

                 o 2.1 - 5068800

                 o 2.2 - 5184000

                 o 4 - 62914560

                 o 4.1 - 62914560

              MaxFrameRate -> (string)
                 If  you  specify auto for FrameRate , Elastic Transcoder uses
                 the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate  of  the
                 output  video.  Specify  the maximum frame rate that you want
                 Elastic Transcoder to use when the frame rate  of  the  input
                 video  is  greater than the desired maximum frame rate of the
                 output video. Valid values include: 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25
                 , 29.97 , 30 , 60 .

              Resolution -> (string)

                 WARNING:
                     To  better  control resolution and aspect ratio of output
                     videos, we recommend that you use the values  MaxWidth  ,
                     MaxHeight  ,  SizingPolicy  ,  PaddingPolicy  ,  and Dis-
                     playAspectRatio instead of Resolution and  AspectRatio  .
                     The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not
                     use them together.

                 The width and height of the video in the output file, in pix-
                 els. Valid values are auto and width x height :

                 o auto  :  Elastic  Transcoder attempts to preserve the width
                   and height of the input  file,  subject  to  the  following
                   rules.

                 o
                   ``
                   width  x  height  ``  :  The width and height of the output
                   video in pixels.

                 Note the following about specifying the width and height:

                 o The width must be an even integer  between  128  and  4096,
                   inclusive.

                 o The  height  must  be  an even integer between 96 and 3072,
                   inclusive.

                 o If you specify a resolution that is less than  the  resolu-
                   tion  of  the  input  file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the
                   output file to the lower resolution.

                 o If you specify a resolution that is greater than the  reso-
                   lution  of  the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the
                   output to the higher resolution.

                 o We recommend that you specify a resolution  for  which  the
                   product  of  width  and height is less than or equal to the
                   applicable value in the following list (List - Max width  x
                   height value ):

                   o 1 - 25344

                   o 1b - 25344

                   o 1.1 - 101376

              AspectRatio -> (string)

                 WARNING:
                     To  better  control resolution and aspect ratio of output
                     videos, we recommend that you use the values  MaxWidth  ,
                     MaxHeight  ,  SizingPolicy  ,  PaddingPolicy  ,  and Dis-
                     playAspectRatio instead of Resolution and  AspectRatio  .
                     The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not
                     use them together.

                 The display aspect ratio of the video  in  the  output  file.
                 Valid values include:
                     auto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                 If  you  specify  auto , Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve
                 the aspect ratio of the input file.

                 If you specify an aspect ratio for the output file that  dif-
                 fers  from aspect ratio of the input file, Elastic Transcoder
                 adds pillarboxing (black bars on the sides)  or  letterboxing
                 (black  bars  on  the  top and bottom) to maintain the aspect
                 ratio of the active region of the video.

              MaxWidth -> (string)
                 The maximum width of the output video in pixels. If you spec-
                 ify  auto  ,  Elastic  Transcoder  uses 1920 (Full HD) as the
                 default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an  even
                 integer between 128 and 4096.

              MaxHeight -> (string)
                 The  maximum  height  of  the  output video in pixels. If you
                 specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as  the
                 default  value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even
                 integer between 96 and 3072.

              DisplayAspectRatio -> (string)
                 The value that Elastic Transcoder adds to the metadata in the
                 output file.

              SizingPolicy -> (string)
                 Specify one of the following values to control scaling of the
                 output video:

                 o Fit : Elastic Transcoder scales  the  output  video  so  it
                   matches  the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or
                   MaxHeight without exceeding the other value.

                 o Fill : Elastic Transcoder scales the  output  video  so  it
                   matches  the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or
                   MaxHeight and matches or exceeds the other  value.  Elastic
                   Transcoder  centers  the  output video and then crops it in
                   the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.

                 o Stretch : Elastic Transcoder stretches the output video  to
                   match  the  values that you specified for MaxWidth and Max-
                   Height . If the relative proportions of the input video and
                   the  output  video  are different, the output video will be
                   distorted.

                 o Keep : Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output  video.
                   If  either  dimension of the input video exceeds the values
                   that you specified for MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight  ,  Elastic
                   Transcoder crops the output video.

                 o ShrinkToFit  :  Elastic  Transcoder scales the output video
                   down so that its dimensions match the values that you spec-
                   ified  for  at  least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without
                   exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic
                   Transcoder does not scale the video up.

                 o ShrinkToFill  :  Elastic Transcoder scales the output video
                   down so that its dimensions match the values that you spec-
                   ified  for  at  least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without
                   dropping below either value. If you  specify  this  option,
                   Elastic Transcoder does not scale the video up.

              PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                 When  you  set  PaddingPolicy to Pad , Elastic Transcoder may
                 add black bars to the top and bottom and/or  left  and  right
                 sides  of the output video to make the total size of the out-
                 put video match the values that you  specified  for  MaxWidth
                 and MaxHeight .

              Watermarks -> (list)
                 Settings for the size, location, and opacity of graphics that
                 you want Elastic Transcoder to overlay over videos  that  are
                 transcoded using this preset. You can specify settings for up
                 to four watermarks. Watermarks appear in the  specified  size
                 and location, and with the specified opacity for the duration
                 of the transcoded video.

                 Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to dis-
                 play  a  watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png for-
                 mat, which supports transparency.

                 When you create a job that uses this preset, you specify  the
                 .png  or  .jpg  graphics  that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 include in the  transcoded  videos.  You  can  specify  fewer
                 graphics  in  the  job than you specify watermark settings in
                 the preset, which allows you to use the same preset for up to
                 four watermarks that have different dimensions.

                 (structure)
                     Settings  for the size, location, and opacity of graphics
                     that you want Elastic Transcoder to overlay  over  videos
                     that  are  transcoded  using this preset. You can specify
                     settings for up to four watermarks. Watermarks appear  in
                     the  specified  size and location, and with the specified
                     opacity for the duration of the transcoded video.

                     Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want  to
                     display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png
                     format, which supports transparency.

                     When you create a job that uses this preset, you  specify
                     the   .png   or  .jpg  graphics  that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder to include in the transcoded videos.  You  can
                     specify fewer graphics in the job than you specify water-
                     mark settings in the preset, which allows you to use  the
                     same preset for up to four watermarks that have different
                     dimensions.

                     Id -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the settings  for  one  water-
                        mark. The value of Id can be up to 40 characters long.

                     MaxWidth -> (string)
                        The maximum width of the watermark in one of the  fol-
                        lowing formats:

                        o number  of pixels (px): The minimum value is 16 pix-
                          els, and the maximum value is the value of  MaxWidth
                          .

                        o integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is
                          0 to 100. Use the value of Target to specify whether
                          you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to include the black
                          bars that are added by Elastic Transcoder,  if  any,
                          in the calculation. If you specify the value in pix-
                          els, it must be less than or equal to the  value  of
                          MaxWidth .

                     MaxHeight -> (string)
                        The maximum height of the watermark in one of the fol-
                        lowing formats:

                        o number of pixels (px): The minimum value is 16  pix-
                          els, and the maximum value is the value of MaxHeight
                          .

                        o integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is
                          0 to 100. Use the value of Target to specify whether
                          you want Elastic Transcoder  to  include  the  black
                          bars  that  are added by Elastic Transcoder, if any,
                          in the calculation.

                        If you specify the value in pixels, it  must  be  less
                        than or equal to the value of MaxHeight .

                     SizingPolicy -> (string)
                        A value that controls scaling of the watermark:

                        o Fit  : Elastic Transcoder scales the watermark so it
                          matches the  value  that  you  specified  in  either
                          MaxWidth  or  MaxHeight  without exceeding the other
                          value.

                        o Stretch : Elastic Transcoder stretches the watermark
                          to  match the values that you specified for MaxWidth
                          and MaxHeight . If the relative proportions  of  the
                          watermark  and  the values of MaxWidth and MaxHeight
                          are different, the watermark will be distorted.

                        o ShrinkToFit : Elastic Transcoder scales  the  water-
                          mark  down  so  that its dimensions match the values
                          that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth  and
                          MaxHeight  without  exceeding  either  value. If you
                          specify this option,  Elastic  Transcoder  does  not
                          scale the watermark up.

                     HorizontalAlign -> (string)
                        The  horizontal  position  of the watermark unless you
                        specify a non-zero value for HorizontalOffset :

                        o Left : The left edge of  the  watermark  is  aligned
                          with the left border of the video.

                        o Right  :  The right edge of the watermark is aligned
                          with the right border of the video.

                        o Center : The watermark is centered between the  left
                          and right borders.

                     HorizontalOffset -> (string)
                        The  amount  by which you want the horizontal position
                        of the watermark to be offset from the position speci-
                        fied by HorizontalAlign:

                        o number  of  pixels (px): The minimum value is 0 pix-
                          els, and the maximum value is the value of MaxWidth.

                        o integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is
                          0 to 100.

                        For example, if you specify Left  for  HorizontalAlign
                        and  5px  for  HorizontalOffset , the left side of the
                        watermark appears 5 pixels from the left border of the
                        output video.
                            HorizontalOffset  is  only valid when the value of
                            HorizontalAlign is Left or Right . If you  specify
                            an  offset  that  causes  the  watermark to extend
                            beyond  the  left  or  right  border  and  Elastic
                            Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark
                            is cropped. If Elastic Transcoder has added  black
                            bars,  the  watermark extends into the black bars.
                            If the watermark extends beyond the black bars, it
                            is cropped.

                        Use the value of Target to specify whether you want to
                        include the black  bars  that  are  added  by  Elastic
                        Transcoder, if any, in the offset calculation.

                     VerticalAlign -> (string)
                        The  vertical  position  of  the  watermark unless you
                        specify a non-zero value for VerticalOffset :

                        o Top : The top edge of the watermark is aligned  with
                          the top border of the video.

                        o Bottom : The bottom edge of the watermark is aligned
                          with the bottom border of the video.

                        o Center : The watermark is centered between  the  top
                          and bottom borders.

                     VerticalOffset -> (string)
                            VerticalOffset

                        The  amount by which you want the vertical position of
                        the watermark to be offset from the position specified
                        by VerticalAlign:

                        o number  of  pixels (px): The minimum value is 0 pix-
                          els, and the maximum value is the value of MaxHeight
                          .

                        o integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is
                          0 to 100.

                        For example, if you specify Top for VerticalAlign  and
                        5px  for  VerticalOffset  ,  the  top of the watermark
                        appears 5 pixels from the top  border  of  the  output
                        video.
                            VerticalOffset  is  only  valid  when the value of
                            VerticalAlign is Top or Bottom.

                        If you specify an offset that causes the watermark  to
                        extend  beyond  the  top  or bottom border and Elastic
                        Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark  is
                        cropped.  If  Elastic Transcoder has added black bars,
                        the watermark extends into  the  black  bars.  If  the
                        watermark   extends  beyond  the  black  bars,  it  is
                        cropped.

                        Use the value of Target to specify  whether  you  want
                        Elastic  Transcoder to include the black bars that are
                        added by Elastic Transcoder, if  any,  in  the  offset
                        calculation.

                     Opacity -> (string)
                        A percentage that indicates how much you want a water-
                        mark to obscure the video in  the  location  where  it
                        appears.  Valid values are 0 (the watermark is invisi-
                        ble) to 100 (the  watermark  completely  obscures  the
                        video  in  the  specified  location).  The datatype of
                        Opacity is float.

                        Elastic Transcoder supports transparent .png graphics.
                        If you use a transparent .png, the transparent portion
                        of the video appears as if you had specified  a  value
                        of  0  for Opacity . The .jpg file format doesn't sup-
                        port transparency.

                     Target -> (string)
                        A value that determines how Elastic Transcoder  inter-
                        prets values that you specified for HorizontalOffset ,
                        VerticalOffset , MaxWidth , and MaxHeight :

                        o Content : HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset values
                          are  calculated  based  on  the borders of the video
                          excluding black bars added by Elastic Transcoder, if
                          any. In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight , if speci-
                          fied as a percentage, are calculated  based  on  the
                          borders  of  the video excluding black bars added by
                          Elastic Transcoder, if any.

                        o Frame : HorizontalOffset and  VerticalOffset  values
                          are  calculated  based  on  the borders of the video
                          including black bars added by Elastic Transcoder, if
                          any. In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight , if speci-
                          fied as a percentage, are calculated  based  on  the
                          borders  of  the video including black bars added by
                          Elastic Transcoder, if any.

          Thumbnails -> (structure)
              A section of the response body that provides  information  about
              the thumbnail preset values, if any.

              Format -> (string)
                 The  format  of  thumbnails, if any. Valid values are jpg and
                 png .

                 You specify whether you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  create
                 thumbnails when you create a job.

              Interval -> (string)
                 The approximate number of seconds between thumbnails. Specify
                 an integer value.

              Resolution -> (string)

                 WARNING:
                     To better control resolution and aspect ratio  of  thumb-
                     nails,  we  recommend  that you use the values MaxWidth ,
                     MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , and PaddingPolicy  instead  of
                     Resolution  and  AspectRatio . The two groups of settings
                     are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.

                 The width and height of thumbnail files in pixels. Specify  a
                 value  in  the  format  `` width `` x `` height `` where both
                 values are even integers. The values cannot exceed the  width
                 and height that you specified in the Video:Resolution object.

              AspectRatio -> (string)

                 WARNING:
                     To better control resolution and aspect ratio  of  thumb-
                     nails,  we  recommend  that you use the values MaxWidth ,
                     MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , and PaddingPolicy  instead  of
                     Resolution  and  AspectRatio . The two groups of settings
                     are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.

                 The aspect ratio of thumbnails. Valid values include:
                     auto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                 If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder  tries  to  preserve
                 the aspect ratio of the video in the output file.

              MaxWidth -> (string)
                 The  maximum  width  of  thumbnails in pixels. If you specify
                 auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD) as  the  default
                 value.  If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer
                 between 32 and 4096.

              MaxHeight -> (string)
                 The maximum height of thumbnails in pixels.  If  you  specify
                 auto,  Elastic  Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default
                 value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even  integer
                 between 32 and 3072.

              SizingPolicy -> (string)
                 Specify  one  of  the  following values to control scaling of
                 thumbnails:

                 o Fit : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails  so  they  match
                   the  value that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or Max-
                   Height settings without exceeding the other value.

                 o Fill : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so  they  match
                   the  value that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or Max-
                   Height settings and matches or  exceeds  the  other  value.
                   Elastic Transcoder centers the image in thumbnails and then
                   crops in the dimension (if any) that  exceeds  the  maximum
                   value.

                 o Stretch  : Elastic Transcoder stretches thumbnails to match
                   the values that you specified for  thumbnail  MaxWidth  and
                   MaxHeight  settings.  If  the  relative  proportions of the
                   input video and thumbnails are  different,  the  thumbnails
                   will be distorted.

                 o Keep  :  Elastic  Transcoder  does not scale thumbnails. If
                   either dimension of the input video exceeds the values that
                   you  specified  for  thumbnail  MaxWidth and MaxHeight set-
                   tings, Elastic Transcoder crops the thumbnails.

                 o ShrinkToFit : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down  so
                   that  their  dimensions match the values that you specified
                   for at least one of thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight  with-
                   out  exceeding  either  value.  If you specify this option,
                   Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.

                 o ShrinkToFill : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down so
                   that  their  dimensions match the values that you specified
                   for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping
                   below  either  value.  If  you specify this option, Elastic
                   Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.

              PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                 When you set PaddingPolicy to Pad ,  Elastic  Transcoder  may
                 add  black  bars  to the top and bottom and/or left and right
                 sides of thumbnails to make the total size of the  thumbnails
                 match  the  values  that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth
                 and MaxHeight settings.

          Type -> (string)
              Whether the preset is  a  default  preset  provided  by  Elastic
              Transcoder  (System  ) or a preset that you have defined (Custom
              ).
