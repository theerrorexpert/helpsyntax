LIST-JOBS-BY-PIPELINE()                                LIST-JOBS-BY-PIPELINE()



NAME
       list-jobs-by-pipeline -

DESCRIPTION
       The ListJobsByPipeline operation gets a list of the jobs currently in a
       pipeline.

       Elastic Transcoder returns all of the jobs currently in  the  specified
       pipeline. The response body contains one element for each job that sat-
       isfies the search criteria.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs-by-pipeline is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Jobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs-by-pipeline
          --pipeline-id <value>
          [--ascending <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-id (string)
          The ID of the pipeline for which you want to get job information.

       --ascending (string)
          To  list  jobs in chronological order by the date and time that they
          were submitted, enter true . To list jobs in  reverse  chronological
          order, enter false .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of ElasticTranscoder jobs in the specified pipeline

       This  example  retrieves a list of ElasticTranscoder jobs in the speci-
       fied pipeline.

       Command:

          aws elastictranscoder list-jobs-by-pipeline --pipeline-id 1111111111111-abcde1

       Output:

          {
             "Jobs": []
          }

OUTPUT
       Jobs -> (list)
          An array of Job objects that are in the specified pipeline.

          (structure)
              A section of the response body that provides  information  about
              the job that is created.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  identifier  that Elastic Transcoder assigned to the job.
                 You use this value to get settings for the job or  to  delete
                 the job.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the job.

              PipelineId -> (string)
                 The  Id  of  the pipeline that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 use for transcoding. The  pipeline  determines  several  set-
                 tings,  including  the  Amazon  S3  bucket from which Elastic
                 Transcoder gets the files to transcode and  the  bucket  into
                 which Elastic Transcoder puts the transcoded files.

              Input -> (structure)
                 A  section  of  the  request  or  response body that provides
                 information about the file that is being transcoded.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the file to transcode. Elsewhere in the  body
                     of  the  JSON  block is the the ID of the pipeline to use
                     for processing the job. The InputBucket  object  in  that
                     pipeline  tells Elastic Transcoder which Amazon S3 bucket
                     to get the file from.

                     If the  file  name  includes  a  prefix,  such  as  cook-
                     ing/lasagna.mpg  ,  include the prefix in the key. If the
                     file isn't in the specified  bucket,  Elastic  Transcoder
                     returns an error.

                 FrameRate -> (string)
                     The  frame  rate  of  the input file. If you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to automatically detect the frame rate of  the
                     input  file,  specify  auto  . If you want to specify the
                     frame rate for the input file, enter one of the following
                     values:
                        10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

                     If  you  specify  a  value  other  than  auto  ,  Elastic
                     Transcoder disables  automatic  detection  of  the  frame
                     rate.

                 Resolution -> (string)
                     This value must be auto , which causes Elastic Transcoder
                     to automatically detect the resolution of the input file.

                 AspectRatio -> (string)
                     The  aspect  ratio of the input file. If you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to automatically detect the  aspect  ratio  of
                     the input file, specify auto . If you want to specify the
                     aspect ratio for the output file, enter one of  the  fol-
                     lowing values:
                        1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                     If  you  specify  a  value  other  than  auto  ,  Elastic
                     Transcoder disables automatic  detection  of  the  aspect
                     ratio.

                 Interlaced -> (string)
                     Whether the input file is interlaced. If you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to automatically detect whether the input file
                     is  interlaced,  specify  auto  .  If you want to specify
                     whether the input file is interlaced, enter  one  of  the
                     following values:
                        true , false

                     If  you  specify  a  value  other  than  auto  ,  Elastic
                     Transcoder disables automatic detection of interlacing.

                 Container -> (string)
                     The container type for the input file. If you want  Elas-
                     tic Transcoder to automatically detect the container type
                     of the input file, specify auto . If you want to  specify
                     the  container  type for the input file, enter one of the
                     following values:
                        3gp , aac , asf , avi , divx , flv , m4a , mkv , mov ,
                        mp3 , mp4 , mpeg , mpeg-ps , mpeg-ts , mxf , ogg , vob
                        , wav , webm

                 Encryption -> (structure)
                     The encryption  settings,  if  any,  that  are  used  for
                     decrypting  your  input  files.  If  your  input  file is
                     encrypted,  you  must  specify  the  mode  that   Elastic
                     Transcoder uses to decrypt your file.

                     Mode -> (string)
                        The specific server-side encryption mode that you want
                        Elastic Transcoder to use when decrypting  your  input
                        files   or   encrypting  your  output  files.  Elastic
                        Transcoder supports the following options:

                        o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used  for
                          encrypting your files.

                        o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3 calls the Amazon Key Manage-
                          ment Service, which creates  and  manages  the  keys
                          that  are  used  for  encrypting  your files. If you
                          specify s3-aws-kms and you don't  want  to  use  the
                          default  key,  you must add the AWS-KMS key that you
                          want to use to your pipeline.

                        o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of  opera-
                          tion originally used for HLS files.

                        o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                        o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of opera-
                          tion that is  an  authenticated  encryption  format,
                          meaning  that  a file, key, or initialization vector
                          that has been tampered  with  fails  the  decryption
                          process.

                        For  all  three AES options, you must provide the fol-
                        lowing settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                        o Key

                        o Key MD5

                        o Initialization Vector

                        WARNING:
                            For the AES modes, your  private  encryption  keys
                            and your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;
                            therefore, it is important that you safely  manage
                            your  encryption keys. If you lose them, you won't
                            be able to unencrypt your data.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  data  encryption  key  that  you   want   Elastic
                        Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file, or that
                        was used to encrypt your input file. The key  must  be
                        base64-encoded and it must be one of the following bit
                        lengths before being base64-encoded:
                            128 , 192 , or 256 .

                        The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                        Management Service.

                     KeyMd5 -> (string)
                        The  MD5  digest  of  the key that you used to encrypt
                        your input file, or that you want  Elastic  Transcoder
                        to use to encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder
                        uses the key digest as a checksum to  make  sure  your
                        key  was not corrupted in transit. The key MD5 must be
                        base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16  bytes  long
                        before being base64-encoded.

                     InitializationVector -> (string)
                        The series of random bits created by a random bit gen-
                        erator, unique for every  encryption  operation,  that
                        you  used to encrypt your input files or that you want
                        Elastic Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt  your  output
                        files.    The    initialization    vector    must   be
                        base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16  bytes  long
                        before being base64-encoded.

                 TimeSpan -> (structure)
                     Settings  for clipping an input. Each input can have dif-
                     ferent clip settings.

                     StartTime -> (string)
                        The place in the input file where you want a  clip  to
                        start.  The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum
                        value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of  a  second)
                        or  sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don't
                        specify a value,  Elastic  Transcoder  starts  at  the
                        beginning of the input file.

                     Duration -> (string)
                        The  duration  of  the  clip. The format can be either
                        HH:mm:ss.SSS  (maximum  value:  23:59:59.999;  SSS  is
                        thousandths  of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value:
                        86399.999). If you  don't  specify  a  value,  Elastic
                        Transcoder  creates  an  output file from StartTime to
                        the end of the file.

                        If you specify a value longer than the duration of the
                        input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the file and
                        returns a warning message.

                 InputCaptions -> (structure)
                     You can configure Elastic Transcoder  to  transcode  cap-
                     tions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All cap-
                     tions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder  supports  two
                     types of captions:

                     o Embedded:  Embedded  captions  are included in the same
                       file as the audio and video.  Elastic  Transcoder  sup-
                       ports only one embedded caption per language, to a max-
                       imum of 300 embedded captions  per  file.  Valid  input
                       values  include:  CEA-608  (EIA-608  ,  first non-empty
                       channel only), CEA-708 (EIA-708 , first non-empty chan-
                       nel   only),  and  mov-text    Valid  outputs  include:
                       mov-text   Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one
                       embedded format per output.

                     o Sidecar:  Sidecar captions are kept in a separate meta-
                       data file from the audio and video data.  Sidecar  cap-
                       tions require a player that is capable of understanding
                       the relationship between the video file and the sidecar
                       file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar cap-
                       tion per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar  captions
                       per  file.  Valid input values include: dfxp (first div
                       element only), ebu-tt , scc , smpt , srt , ttml  (first
                       div  element only), and webvtt   Valid outputs include:
                       dfxp (first div element only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                     If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify
                     dfxp as your output format.

                     Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical  Charac-
                     ter  Recognition),  does  not  accept pictures as a valid
                     input for captions, and is not available  for  audio-only
                     transcoding.  Elastic  Transcoder  does not preserve text
                     formatting (for example, italics) during the  transcoding
                     process.

                     To  remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Cap-
                     tions  to  null.  To  pass  through   existing   captions
                     unchanged,  set the MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and pass
                     in a null CaptionSources array.

                     For more information on embedded files, see the Subtitles
                     Wikipedia page.

                     For more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible
                     Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

                     MergePolicy -> (string)
                        A policy that determines how Elastic  Transcoder  han-
                        dles the existence of multiple captions.

                        o MergeOverride:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes both
                          embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If  cap-
                          tions  for a language are embedded in the input file
                          and  also  appear  in  a   sidecar   file,   Elastic
                          Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the
                          embedded captions for that language.

                        o MergeRetain:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes   both
                          embedded  and sidecar captions into outputs. If cap-
                          tions for a language are embedded in the input  file
                          and   also   appear   in  a  sidecar  file,  Elastic
                          Transcoder uses the embedded  captions  and  ignores
                          the  sidecar captions for that language. If Caption-
                          Sources is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all side-
                          car captions from the output files.

                        o Override:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes  only the
                          sidecar captions that you specify in  CaptionSources
                          .
                            MergePolicy cannot be null.

                     CaptionSources -> (list)
                        Source  files for the input sidecar captions used dur-
                        ing the transcoding process. To omit all sidecar  cap-
                        tions, leave CaptionSources blank.

                        (structure)
                            A  source file for the input sidecar captions used
                            during the transcoding process.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The name of the sidecar caption file  that  you
                               want  Elastic Transcoder to include in the out-
                               put file.

                            Language -> (string)
                               A string that specifies  the  language  of  the
                               caption.  If you specified multiple inputs with
                               captions, the caption language  must  match  in
                               order  to  be  included  in the output. Specify
                               this as one of:

                               o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                               o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                               For more information on ISO language codes  and
                               language  names,  see  the  List  of  ISO 639-1
                               codes.

                            TimeOffset -> (string)
                               For clip generation or  captions  that  do  not
                               start  at the same time as the associated video
                               file, the TimeOffset tells  Elastic  Transcoder
                               how  much of the video to encode before includ-
                               ing captions.

                               Specify the TimeOffset in the  form  [+-]SS.sss
                               or [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                            Label -> (string)
                               The  label  of  the caption shown in the player
                               when choosing a language. We recommend that you
                               put the caption language name here, in the lan-
                               guage of the captions.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               The encryption settings, if any,  that  Elastic
                               Transcoder   needs   to  decyrpt  your  caption
                               sources, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                               apply to your caption sources.

                               Mode -> (string)
                                   The  specific  server-side  encryption mode
                                   that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use
                                   when   decrypting   your   input  files  or
                                   encrypting  your  output   files.   Elastic
                                   Transcoder supports the following options:

                                   o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates  and manages the
                                     keys used for encrypting your files.

                                   o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3  calls  the  Amazon
                                     Key Management Service, which creates and
                                     manages  the  keys  that  are  used   for
                                     encrypting  your  files.  If  you specify
                                     s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use  the
                                     default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key
                                     that you want to use to your pipeline.

                                   o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode
                                     of  operation  originally  used  for  HLS
                                     files.

                                   o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                                   o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode
                                     of  operation  that  is  an authenticated
                                     encryption format, meaning that  a  file,
                                     key,  or  initialization  vector that has
                                     been tampered with fails  the  decryption
                                     process.

                                   For all three AES options, you must provide
                                   the  following  settings,  which  must   be
                                   base64-encoded:

                                   o Key

                                   o Key MD5

                                   o Initialization Vector

                                   WARNING:
                                      For  the AES modes, your private encryp-
                                      tion keys and your unencrypted data  are
                                      never  stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is
                                      important that you  safely  manage  your
                                      encryption  keys.  If you lose them, you
                                      won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The data encryption key that you want Elas-
                                   tic  Transcoder to use to encrypt your out-
                                   put file, or that was used to encrypt  your
                                   input  file. The key must be base64-encoded
                                   and it must be one  of  the  following  bit
                                   lengths before being base64-encoded:
                                      128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                   The key must also be encrypted by using the
                                   Amazon Key Management Service.

                               KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                   The MD5 digest of the key that you used  to
                                   encrypt  your  input file, or that you want
                                   Elastic Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your
                                   output  file.  Elastic  Transcoder uses the
                                   key digest as a checksum to make sure  your
                                   key  was  not corrupted in transit. The key
                                   MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must  be
                                   exactly   16   bytes   long   before  being
                                   base64-encoded.

                               InitializationVector -> (string)
                                   The series of random bits created by a ran-
                                   dom bit generator, unique for every encryp-
                                   tion operation, that you  used  to  encrypt
                                   your  input  files or that you want Elastic
                                   Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output
                                   files.  The  initialization  vector must be
                                   base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16
                                   bytes long before being base64-encoded.

                 DetectedProperties -> (structure)
                     The detected properties of the input file.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        The detected width of the input file, in pixels.

                     Height -> (integer)
                        The detected height of the input file, in pixels.

                     FrameRate -> (string)
                        The  detected  frame rate of the input file, in frames
                        per second.

                     FileSize -> (long)
                        The detected file size of the input file, in bytes.

                     DurationMillis -> (long)
                        The detected duration of the input file, in  millisec-
                        onds.

              Inputs -> (list)
                 Information  about  the files that you're transcoding. If you
                 specified multiple files for  this  job,  Elastic  Transcoder
                 stitches the files together to make one output.

                 (structure)
                     Information about the file that you're transcoding.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the file to transcode. Elsewhere in the
                        body of the JSON block is the the ID of  the  pipeline
                        to  use for processing the job. The InputBucket object
                        in that pipeline tells Elastic Transcoder which Amazon
                        S3 bucket to get the file from.

                        If  the  file  name  includes  a prefix, such as cook-
                        ing/lasagna.mpg , include the prefix in  the  key.  If
                        the  file  isn't  in  the  specified  bucket,  Elastic
                        Transcoder returns an error.

                     FrameRate -> (string)
                        The frame rate of the input file. If you want  Elastic
                        Transcoder  to  automatically detect the frame rate of
                        the input file, specify auto . If you want to  specify
                        the  frame  rate  for the input file, enter one of the
                        following values:
                            10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

                        If you specify a  value  other  than  auto  ,  Elastic
                        Transcoder  disables  automatic detection of the frame
                        rate.

                     Resolution -> (string)
                        This  value  must  be  auto  ,  which  causes  Elastic
                        Transcoder  to  automatically detect the resolution of
                        the input file.

                     AspectRatio -> (string)
                        The aspect ratio of the input file. If you want  Elas-
                        tic  Transcoder  to  automatically  detect  the aspect
                        ratio of the input file, specify auto . If you want to
                        specify  the  aspect  ratio for the output file, enter
                        one of the following values:
                            1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                        If you specify a  value  other  than  auto  ,  Elastic
                        Transcoder  disables automatic detection of the aspect
                        ratio.

                     Interlaced -> (string)
                        Whether the input file  is  interlaced.  If  you  want
                        Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect whether the
                        input file is interlaced, specify auto . If  you  want
                        to specify whether the input file is interlaced, enter
                        one of the following values:
                            true , false

                        If you specify a  value  other  than  auto  ,  Elastic
                        Transcoder  disables  automatic detection of interlac-
                        ing.

                     Container -> (string)
                        The container type for the input  file.  If  you  want
                        Elastic  Transcoder  to  automatically detect the con-
                        tainer type of the input file, specify auto .  If  you
                        want to specify the container type for the input file,
                        enter one of the following values:
                            3gp , aac , asf , avi , divx , flv , m4a ,  mkv  ,
                            mov , mp3 , mp4 , mpeg , mpeg-ps , mpeg-ts , mxf ,
                            ogg , vob , wav , webm

                     Encryption -> (structure)
                        The encryption settings, if any,  that  are  used  for
                        decrypting  your  input  files.  If your input file is
                        encrypted, you must  specify  the  mode  that  Elastic
                        Transcoder uses to decrypt your file.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            The  specific server-side encryption mode that you
                            want Elastic Transcoder  to  use  when  decrypting
                            your  input files or encrypting your output files.
                            Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:

                            o s3:  Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used
                              for encrypting your files.

                            o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key  Man-
                              agement  Service,  which creates and manages the
                              keys that are used for encrypting your files. If
                              you specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use
                              the default key, you must add  the  AWS-KMS  key
                              that you want to use to your pipeline.

                            o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A  padded  cipher-block  mode of
                              operation originally used for HLS files.

                            o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                            o aes-gcm: AES Galois  Counter  Mode,  a  mode  of
                              operation  that  is  an authenticated encryption
                              format, meaning that a file, key, or initializa-
                              tion  vector  that  has been tampered with fails
                              the decryption process.

                            For all three AES options, you  must  provide  the
                            following settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                            o Key

                            o Key MD5

                            o Initialization Vector

                            WARNING:
                               For the AES modes, your private encryption keys
                               and your unencrypted data are never  stored  by
                               AWS; therefore, it is important that you safely
                               manage your encryption keys. If you lose  them,
                               you won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  data  encryption  key  that  you want Elastic
                            Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file,  or
                            that  was used to encrypt your input file. The key
                            must be base64-encoded and it must be one  of  the
                            following bit lengths before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                            The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon
                            Key Management Service.

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt
                            your  input  file,  or  that  you   want   Elastic
                            Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt your output file.
                            Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a check-
                            sum  to  make  sure  your key was not corrupted in
                            transit. The key MD5 must be  base64-encoded,  and
                            it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes long before being
                            base64-encoded.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            The series of random bits created by a random  bit
                            generator,  unique for every encryption operation,
                            that you used to encrypt your input files or  that
                            you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your
                            output files. The initialization  vector  must  be
                            base64-encoded,  and  it  must be exactly 16 bytes
                            long before being base64-encoded.

                     TimeSpan -> (structure)
                        Settings for clipping an input. Each  input  can  have
                        different clip settings.

                        StartTime -> (string)
                            The  place in the input file where you want a clip
                            to start. The format can  be  either  HH:mm:ss.SSS
                            (maximum  value:  23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths
                            of  a  second)  or   sssss.SSS   (maximum   value:
                            86399.999).  If you don't specify a value, Elastic
                            Transcoder starts at the beginning  of  the  input
                            file.

                        Duration -> (string)
                            The duration of the clip. The format can be either
                            HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS  is
                            thousandths  of  a  second)  or sssss.SSS (maximum
                            value: 86399.999). If you don't specify  a  value,
                            Elastic  Transcoder  creates  an  output file from
                            StartTime to the end of the file.

                            If you specify a value longer than the duration of
                            the  input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the
                            file and returns a warning message.

                     InputCaptions -> (structure)
                        You can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode cap-
                        tions,  or  subtitles, from one format to another. All
                        captions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports
                        two types of captions:

                        o Embedded: Embedded captions are included in the same
                          file as the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder sup-
                          ports  only  one embedded caption per language, to a
                          maximum of 300 embedded  captions  per  file.  Valid
                          input  values  include:  CEA-608  (EIA-608  ,  first
                          non-empty channel only), CEA-708  (EIA-708  ,  first
                          non-empty  channel  only), and mov-text   Valid out-
                          puts include: mov-text   Elastic Transcoder supports
                          a maximum of one embedded format per output.

                        o Sidecar:  Sidecar  captions  are  kept in a separate
                          metadata file from the audio and video data. Sidecar
                          captions  require a player that is capable of under-
                          standing the relationship between the video file and
                          the  sidecar  file. Elastic Transcoder supports only
                          one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20
                          sidecar   captions  per  file.  Valid  input  values
                          include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt , scc
                          ,  smpt  ,  srt , ttml (first div element only), and
                          webvtt   Valid outputs include: dfxp (first div ele-
                          ment only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                        If  you  want  ttml  or  smpte-tt compatible captions,
                        specify dfxp as your output format.

                        Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Char-
                        acter  Recognition),  does  not  accept  pictures as a
                        valid input for captions, and  is  not  available  for
                        audio-only  transcoding.  Elastic  Transcoder does not
                        preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during
                        the transcoding process.

                        To  remove  captions  or leave the captions empty, set
                        Captions to null. To pass  through  existing  captions
                        unchanged,  set  the  MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and
                        pass in a null CaptionSources array.

                        For more information on embedded files, see the Subti-
                        tles Wikipedia page.

                        For  more information on sidecar files, see the Exten-
                        sible Metadata Platform  and  Sidecar  file  Wikipedia
                        pages.

                        MergePolicy -> (string)
                            A  policy  that  determines how Elastic Transcoder
                            handles the existence of multiple captions.

                            o MergeOverride:  Elastic  Transcoder   transcodes
                              both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs.
                              If captions for a language are embedded  in  the
                              input  file  and  also appear in a sidecar file,
                              Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and
                              ignores the embedded captions for that language.

                            o MergeRetain: Elastic Transcoder transcodes  both
                              embedded  and  sidecar captions into outputs. If
                              captions for a  language  are  embedded  in  the
                              input  file  and  also appear in a sidecar file,
                              Elastic Transcoder uses  the  embedded  captions
                              and  ignores  the sidecar captions for that lan-
                              guage.  If  CaptionSources  is  empty,   Elastic
                              Transcoder  omits  all sidecar captions from the
                              output files.

                            o Override: Elastic Transcoder transcodes only the
                              sidecar  captions  that  you specify in Caption-
                              Sources .
                               MergePolicy cannot be null.

                        CaptionSources -> (list)
                            Source files for the input sidecar  captions  used
                            during  the transcoding process. To omit all side-
                            car captions, leave CaptionSources blank.

                            (structure)
                               A source file for the  input  sidecar  captions
                               used during the transcoding process.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  name  of the sidecar caption file that
                                   you want Elastic Transcoder to  include  in
                                   the output file.

                               Language -> (string)
                                   A string that specifies the language of the
                                   caption. If you specified  multiple  inputs
                                   with  captions,  the  caption language must
                                   match in order to be included in  the  out-
                                   put. Specify this as one of:

                                   o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                                   o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                                   For  more information on ISO language codes
                                   and language names, see  the  List  of  ISO
                                   639-1 codes.

                               TimeOffset -> (string)
                                   For clip generation or captions that do not
                                   start at the same time  as  the  associated
                                   video  file,  the  TimeOffset tells Elastic
                                   Transcoder how much of the video to  encode
                                   before including captions.

                                   Specify   the   TimeOffset   in   the  form
                                   [+-]SS.sss or [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                               Label -> (string)
                                   The label  of  the  caption  shown  in  the
                                   player  when choosing a language. We recom-
                                   mend that you put the caption language name
                                   here, in the language of the captions.

                               Encryption -> (structure)
                                   The encryption settings, if any, that Elas-
                                   tic Transcoder needs to decyrpt  your  cap-
                                   tion  sources,  or  that  you  want Elastic
                                   Transcoder  to  apply   to   your   caption
                                   sources.

                                   Mode -> (string)
                                      The specific server-side encryption mode
                                      that you want Elastic Transcoder to  use
                                      when  decrypting  your  input  files  or
                                      encrypting your  output  files.  Elastic
                                      Transcoder    supports   the   following
                                      options:

                                      o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages  the
                                        keys used for encrypting your files.

                                      o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon

                                          encryption keys and your unencrypted
                                          data are never stored by AWS; there-
                                          fore,  it  is  important  that   you
                                          safely  manage your encryption keys.
                                          If you lose them, you won't be  able
                                          to unencrypt your data.

                                   Key -> (string)
                                      The  data  encryption  key that you want
                                      Elastic Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt
                                      your  output  file,  or that was used to
                                      encrypt your input file. The key must be
                                      base64-encoded and it must be one of the
                                      following  bit  lengths   before   being
                                      base64-encoded:
                                          128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                      The  key must also be encrypted by using
                                      the Amazon Key Management Service.

                                   KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                      The MD5 digest of the key that you  used
                                      to  encrypt your input file, or that you
                                      want  Elastic  Transcoder  to   use   to
                                      encrypt   your   output   file.  Elastic
                                      Transcoder uses  the  key  digest  as  a
                                      checksum  to  make sure your key was not
                                      corrupted in transit. The key  MD5  must
                                      be   base64-encoded,   and  it  must  be
                                      exactly  16  bytes  long  before   being
                                      base64-encoded.

                                   InitializationVector -> (string)
                                      The  series  of random bits created by a
                                      random bit generator, unique  for  every
                                      encryption  operation,  that you used to
                                      encrypt your input  files  or  that  you
                                      want   Elastic   Transcoder  to  use  to
                                      encrypt your output files. The  initial-
                                      ization  vector  must be base64-encoded,
                                      and it must be  exactly  16  bytes  long
                                      before being base64-encoded.

                     DetectedProperties -> (structure)
                        The detected properties of the input file.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            The detected width of the input file, in pixels.

                        Height -> (integer)
                            The  detected height of the input file, in pixels.

                        FrameRate -> (string)
                            The detected frame rate  of  the  input  file,  in
                            frames per second.

                        FileSize -> (long)
                            The  detected  file  size  of  the  input file, in
                            bytes.

                        DurationMillis -> (long)
                            The detected duration of the input file,  in  mil-
                            liseconds.

              Output -> (structure)
                 If you specified one output for a job, information about that
                 output. If you specified multiple outputs for a job, the Out-
                 put  object  lists  information  about the first output. This
                 duplicates the information that is listed for the first  out-
                 put in the Outputs object.

                 WARNING:
                     Outputs recommended instead.

                 A  section  of  the  request  or  response body that provides
                 information about the transcoded (target) file.

                 Id -> (string)
                     A sequential counter, starting with 1, that identifies an
                     output  among  the  outputs  from the current job. In the
                     Output syntax, this value is always 1.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name  to  assign  to  the  transcoded  file.  Elastic
                     Transcoder  saves the file in the Amazon S3 bucket speci-
                     fied by the OutputBucket object in the pipeline  that  is
                     specified by the pipeline ID.

                 ThumbnailPattern -> (string)
                     Whether  you want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails
                     for  your  videos  and,  if  so,  how  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder to name the files.

                     If  you  don't  want  Elastic Transcoder to create thumb-
                     nails, specify "".

                     If you do want Elastic Transcoder to  create  thumbnails,
                     specify  the  information that you want to include in the
                     file name for each thumbnail. You can specify the follow-
                     ing values in any sequence:

                     o ``{count}``  (Required)  : If you want to create thumb-
                       nails, you must include {count} in the ThumbnailPattern
                       object.   Wherever   you   specify  {count}  ,  Elastic
                       Transcoder adds a five-digit sequence number (beginning
                       with  00001 ) to thumbnail file names. The number indi-
                       cates where a given thumbnail appears in  the  sequence
                       of thumbnails for a transcoded file.

                     WARNING:
                        If you specify a literal value and/or {resolution} but
                        you omit {count} , Elastic Transcoder returns a  vali-
                        dation error and does not create the job.

                     o Literal  values  (Optional)  :  You can specify literal
                       values anywhere in  the  ThumbnailPattern  object.  For
                       example,  you can include them as a file name prefix or
                       as a delimiter between {resolution} and {count} .

                     o ``{resolution}``  (Optional)  :  If  you  want  Elastic
                       Transcoder  to include the resolution in the file name,
                       include {resolution} in the ThumbnailPattern object.

                     When creating thumbnails,  Elastic  Transcoder  automati-
                     cally  saves  the files in the format (.jpg or .png) that
                     appears in the preset that you specified in the  PresetID
                     value   of  CreateJobOutput  .  Elastic  Transcoder  also
                     appends the applicable file name extension.

                 ThumbnailEncryption -> (structure)
                     The encryption settings, if any, that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder to apply to your thumbnail.

                     Mode -> (string)
                        The specific server-side encryption mode that you want
                        Elastic Transcoder to use when decrypting  your  input
                        files   or   encrypting  your  output  files.  Elastic
                        Transcoder supports the following options:

                        o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used  for
                          encrypting your files.

                        o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3 calls the Amazon Key Manage-
                          ment Service, which creates  and  manages  the  keys
                          that  are  used  for  encrypting  your files. If you
                          specify s3-aws-kms and you don't  want  to  use  the
                          default  key,  you must add the AWS-KMS key that you
                          want to use to your pipeline.

                        o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of  opera-
                          tion originally used for HLS files.

                        o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                        o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of opera-
                          tion that is  an  authenticated  encryption  format,
                          meaning  that  a file, key, or initialization vector
                          that has been tampered  with  fails  the  decryption
                          process.

                        For  all  three AES options, you must provide the fol-
                        lowing settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                        o Key

                        o Key MD5

                        o Initialization Vector

                        WARNING:
                            For the AES modes, your  private  encryption  keys
                            and your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;
                            therefore, it is important that you safely  manage
                            your  encryption keys. If you lose them, you won't
                            be able to unencrypt your data.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  data  encryption  key  that  you   want   Elastic
                        Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file, or that
                        was used to encrypt your input file. The key  must  be
                        base64-encoded and it must be one of the following bit
                        lengths before being base64-encoded:
                            128 , 192 , or 256 .

                        The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                        Management Service.

                     KeyMd5 -> (string)
                        The  MD5  digest  of  the key that you used to encrypt
                        your input file, or that you want  Elastic  Transcoder
                        to use to encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder
                        uses the key digest as a checksum to  make  sure  your
                        key  was not corrupted in transit. The key MD5 must be
                        base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16  bytes  long
                        before being base64-encoded.

                     InitializationVector -> (string)
                        The series of random bits created by a random bit gen-
                        erator, unique for every  encryption  operation,  that
                        you  used to encrypt your input files or that you want
                        Elastic Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt  your  output
                        files.    The    initialization    vector    must   be
                        base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16  bytes  long
                        before being base64-encoded.

                 Rotate -> (string)
                     The number of degrees clockwise by which you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to rotate the output relative  to  the  input.
                     Enter one of the following values:
                        auto , 0 , 90 , 180 , 270

                     The  value  auto  generally  works  only if the file that
                     you're transcoding contains rotation metadata.

                 PresetId -> (string)
                     The value of the Id object for the preset that  you  want
                     to  use  for  this  job. The preset determines the audio,
                     video, and thumbnail  settings  that  Elastic  Transcoder
                     uses  for  transcoding. To use a preset that you created,
                     specify the preset ID that Elastic Transcoder returned in
                     the  response  when  you created the preset. You can also
                     use the Elastic Transcoder system presets, which you  can
                     get with ListPresets .

                     If  you  specify a preset in PresetId for which the value
                     of Container is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4)  or  ts  (MPEG-TS),
                     SegmentDuration  is  the  target maximum duration of each
                     segment in seconds.  For  HLSv3  format  playlists,  each
                     media segment is stored in a separate .ts file. For HLSv4
                     , MPEG-DASH , and Smooth playlists,  all  media  segments
                     for  an  output are stored in a single file. Each segment
                     is approximately the  length  of  the  SegmentDuration  ,
                     though individual segments might be shorter or longer.

                     The  range  of  valid  values  is 1 to 60 seconds. If the
                     duration of the video is not evenly divisible by Segment-
                     Duration  ,  the  duration  of  the  last  segment is the
                     remainder of total length/SegmentDuration.

                     Elastic Transcoder creates  an  output-specific  playlist
                     for  each  output  HLS  output  that  you specify in Out-
                     putKeys. To add an output to the master playlist for this
                     job,  include  it  in  the  OutputKeys  of the associated
                     playlist.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of one output in a job. If you specified  only
                     one output for the job, Outputs:Status is always the same
                     as Job:Status . If you specified more than one output:

                     o Job:Status and Outputs:Status for all of the outputs is
                       Submitted  until  Elastic  Transcoder starts to process
                       the first output.

                     o When Elastic Transcoder starts  to  process  the  first
                       output,  Outputs:Status  for that output and Job:Status
                       both change to Progressing. For each output, the  value
                       of   Outputs:Status  remains  Submitted  until  Elastic
                       Transcoder starts to process the output.

                     o Job:Status remains Progressing until all of the outputs
                       reach a terminal status, either Complete or Error.

                     o When  all  of  the  outputs  reach  a  terminal status,
                       Job:Status changes to Complete only  if  Outputs:Status
                       for  all of the outputs is Complete . If Outputs:Status
                       for one or more outputs is Error , the terminal  status
                       for Job:Status is also Error .

                     The  value of Status is one of the following: Submitted ,
                     Progressing , Complete , Canceled , or Error .

                 StatusDetail -> (string)
                     Information that further explains Status .

                 Duration -> (long)
                     Duration of the output file, in seconds.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     Specifies the width of the output file in pixels.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     Height of the output file, in pixels.

                 FrameRate -> (string)
                     Frame rate of the output file, in frames per second.

                 FileSize -> (long)
                     File size of the output file, in bytes.

                 DurationMillis -> (long)
                     Duration of the output file, in milliseconds.

                 Watermarks -> (list)
                     Information about the watermarks that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder  to  add  to the video during transcoding. You
                     can specify up to four watermarks for each  output.  Set-
                     tings  for  each  watermark must be defined in the preset
                     that you specify in Preset for the current output.

                     Watermarks are added to the output video in the  sequence
                     in  which you list them in the job outputthe first water-
                     mark in the list is added to the output video first,  the
                     second watermark in the list is added next, and so on. As
                     a result, if the  settings  in  a  preset  cause  Elastic
                     Transcoder  to place all watermarks in the same location,
                     the second watermark that you add covers the  first  one,
                     the  third one covers the second, and the fourth one cov-
                     ers the third.

                     (structure)
                        Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you  want
                        to  display  a  watermark that is not rectangular, use
                        the .png format, which supports transparency.

                        PresetWatermarkId -> (string)
                            The ID of  the  watermark  settings  that  Elastic
                            Transcoder  uses  to  add  watermarks to the video
                            during transcoding. The settings are in the preset
                            specified  by  Preset  for  the current output. In
                            that preset, the  value  of  Watermarks  Id  tells
                            Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.

                        InputKey -> (string)
                            The name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to
                            use for the watermark. To determine  which  Amazon
                            S3  bucket  contains  the  specified file, Elastic
                            Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by  Pipe-
                            line  ;  the  Input Bucket object in that pipeline
                            identifies the bucket.

                            If the file name includes a prefix,  for  example,
                            logos/128x64.png  , include the prefix in the key.
                            If the file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic
                            Transcoder returns an error.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The  encryption  settings,  if  any, that you want
                            Elastic Transcoder to apply to your watermarks.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The specific server-side encryption  mode  that
                               you   want   Elastic  Transcoder  to  use  when
                               decrypting your input files or encrypting  your
                               output  files.  Elastic Transcoder supports the
                               following options:

                               o s3: Amazon S3 creates and  manages  the  keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3  calls the Amazon Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the  keys  that  are used for encrypting your
                                 files. If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and  you
                                 don't  want  to use the default key, you must
                                 add the AWS-KMS key that you want to  use  to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode  of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-
                                 ization  vector  that  has been tampered with
                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following     settings,     which    must    be
                               base64-encoded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                               WARNING:
                                   For the AES modes, your private  encryption
                                   keys  and  your  unencrypted data are never
                                   stored by AWS; therefore, it  is  important
                                   that  you  safely  manage  your  encryption
                                   keys. If you lose them, you won't  be  able
                                   to unencrypt your data.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The  data  encryption key that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder to use to encrypt your output  file,
                               or  that  was  used to encrypt your input file.
                               The key must be base64-encoded and it  must  be
                               one  of  the following bit lengths before being
                               base64-encoded:
                                   128 , 192 , or 256 .

                               The key must also be  encrypted  by  using  the
                               Amazon Key Management Service.

                            KeyMd5 -> (string)
                               The  MD5  digest  of  the  key that you used to
                               encrypt your input file, or that you want Elas-
                               tic  Transcoder  to  use to encrypt your output
                               file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as
                               a  checksum  to make sure your key was not cor-
                               rupted  in  transit.  The  key  MD5   must   be
                               base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes
                               long before being base64-encoded.

                            InitializationVector -> (string)
                               The series of random bits created by  a  random
                               bit  generator,  unique  for  every  encryption
                               operation, that you used to encrypt your  input
                               files  or  that  you want Elastic Transcoder to
                               use to encrypt your output files. The  initial-
                               ization  vector  must be base64-encoded, and it
                               must be exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                               base64-encoded.

                 AlbumArt -> (structure)
                     The  album  art to be associated with the output file, if
                     any.

                     MergePolicy -> (string)
                        A policy that determines how Elastic  Transcoder  han-
                        dles the existence of multiple album artwork files.

                        o Replace: The specified album art replaces any exist-
                          ing album art.

                        o Prepend: The specified album art is placed in  front
                          of any existing album art.

                        o Append:  The specified album art is placed after any
                          existing album art.

                        o Fallback: If the original input file  contains  art-
                          work,  Elastic  Transcoder uses that artwork for the
                          output. If the original input does not contain  art-
                          work,  Elastic  Transcoder  uses the specified album
                          art file.

                     Artwork -> (list)
                        The file to be used as album art. There can be  multi-
                        ple artworks associated with an audio file, to a maxi-
                        mum of 20. Valid formats are .jpg and .png

                        (structure)
                            The file to be used as album  art.  There  can  be
                            multiple  artworks  associated with an audio file,
                            to a maximum of 20.

                            To remove artwork or leave the artwork empty,  you
                            can  either  set Artwork to null, or set the Merge
                            Policy to  "Replace"  and  use  an  empty  Artwork
                            array.

                            To  pass  through  existing artwork unchanged, set
                            the Merge Policy to "Prepend", "Append", or "Fall-
                            back", and use an empty Artwork array.

                            InputKey -> (string)
                               The  name  of the file to be used as album art.
                               To determine which Amazon  S3  bucket  contains
                               the  specified  file, Elastic Transcoder checks
                               the pipeline  specified  by  PipelineId  ;  the
                               InputBucket  object in that pipeline identifies
                               the bucket.

                               If the file name includes a prefix,  for  exam-
                               ple,  cooking/pie.jpg  ,  include the prefix in
                               the key. If the file  isn't  in  the  specified
                               bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.

                            MaxWidth -> (string)
                               The  maximum  width  of the output album art in
                               pixels.  If  you   specify   auto   ,   Elastic
                               Transcoder  uses  600  as the default value. If
                               you specify a  numeric  value,  enter  an  even
                               integer between 32 and 4096, inclusive.

                            MaxHeight -> (string)
                               The  maximum  height of the output album art in
                               pixels.  If  you   specify   auto   ,   Elastic
                               Transcoder  uses  600  as the default value. If
                               you specify a  numeric  value,  enter  an  even
                               integer between 32 and 3072, inclusive.

                            SizingPolicy -> (string)
                               Specify  one of the following values to control
                               scaling of the output album art:

                               o Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output art
                                 so it matches the value that you specified in
                                 either MaxWidth or MaxHeight without  exceed-
                                 ing the other value.

                               o Fill:  Elastic  Transcoder  scales the output
                                 art so it matches the value that  you  speci-
                                 fied  in  either  MaxWidth  or  MaxHeight and
                                 matches or exceeds the other  value.  Elastic
                                 Transcoder  centers  the  output art and then
                                 crops it  in  the  dimension  (if  any)  that
                                 exceeds the maximum value.

                               o Stretch:  Elastic  Transcoder  stretches  the
                                 output art to match the values that you spec-
                                 ified  for  MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight . If the
                                 relative proportions of the input art and the
                                 output art are different, the output art will
                                 be distorted.

                               o Keep: Elastic Transcoder does not  scale  the
                                 output  art. If either dimension of the input
                                 art exceeds the values that you specified for
                                 MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight , Elastic Transcoder
                                 crops the output art.

                               o ShrinkToFit: Elastic  Transcoder  scales  the
                                 output  art down so that its dimensions match
                                 the values that you specified  for  at  least
                                 one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceed-
                                 ing either value. If you specify this option,
                                 Elastic Transcoder does not scale the art up.

                               o ShrinkToFill Elastic  Transcoder  scales  the
                                 output  art down so that its dimensions match
                                 the values that you specified  for  at  least
                                 one  of  MaxWidth and MaxHeight without drop-
                                 ping below either value. If you specify  this
                                 option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the
                                 art up.

                            PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                               When you set PaddingPolicy  to  Pad  ,  Elastic
                               Transcoder  may  add  white bars to the top and
                               bottom and/or left and right sides of the  out-
                               put  album  art  to  make the total size of the
                               output art match the values that you  specified
                               for MaxWidth and MaxHeight .

                            AlbumArtFormat -> (string)
                               The  format of album art, if any. Valid formats
                               are .jpg and .png .

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               The encryption settings, if any, that you  want
                               Elastic Transcoder to apply to your artwork.

                               Mode -> (string)
                                   The  specific  server-side  encryption mode
                                   that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use
                                   when   decrypting   your   input  files  or
                                   encrypting  your  output   files.   Elastic
                                   Transcoder supports the following options:

                                   o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates  and manages the
                                     keys used for encrypting your files.

                                   o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3  calls  the  Amazon
                                     Key Management Service, which creates and
                                     manages  the  keys  that  are  used   for
                                     encrypting  your  files.  If  you specify
                                     s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use  the
                                     default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key
                                     that you want to use to your pipeline.

                                   o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode
                                     of  operation  originally  used  for  HLS
                                     files.

                                   o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                                   o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode
                                     of  operation  that  is  an authenticated
                                     encryption format, meaning that  a  file,
                                     key,  or  initialization  vector that has
                                     been tampered with fails  the  decryption
                                     process.

                                   For all three AES options, you must provide
                                   the  following  settings,  which  must   be
                                   base64-encoded:

                                   o Key

                                   o Key MD5

                                   o Initialization Vector

                                   WARNING:
                                      For  the AES modes, your private encryp-
                                      tion keys and your unencrypted data  are
                                      never  stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is
                                      important that you  safely  manage  your
                                      encryption  keys.  If you lose them, you
                                      won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The data encryption key that you want Elas-
                                   tic  Transcoder to use to encrypt your out-
                                   put file, or that was used to encrypt  your
                                   input  file. The key must be base64-encoded
                                   and it must be one  of  the  following  bit
                                   lengths before being base64-encoded:
                                      128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                   The key must also be encrypted by using the
                                   Amazon Key Management Service.

                               KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                   The MD5 digest of the key that you used  to
                                   encrypt  your  input file, or that you want
                                   Elastic Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your
                                   output  file.  Elastic  Transcoder uses the
                                   key digest as a checksum to make sure  your
                                   key  was  not corrupted in transit. The key
                                   MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must  be
                                   exactly   16   bytes   long   before  being
                                   base64-encoded.

                               InitializationVector -> (string)
                                   The series of random bits created by a ran-
                                   dom bit generator, unique for every encryp-
                                   tion operation, that you  used  to  encrypt
                                   your  input  files or that you want Elastic
                                   Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output
                                   files.  The  initialization  vector must be
                                   base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16
                                   bytes long before being base64-encoded.

                 Composition -> (list)
                     You  can  create  an output file that contains an excerpt
                     from the input file. This excerpt,  called  a  clip,  can
                     come  from the beginning, middle, or end of the file. The
                     Composition object contains settings for the  clips  that
                     make  up an output file. For the current release, you can
                     only specify settings for a single clip per output  file.
                     The Composition object cannot be null.

                     (structure)
                        Settings  for one clip in a composition. All jobs in a
                        playlist must have the same clip settings.

                        TimeSpan -> (structure)
                            Settings that determine when a clip begins and how
                            long it lasts.

                            StartTime -> (string)
                               The  place  in  the input file where you want a
                               clip  to  start.  The  format  can  be   either
                               HH:mm:ss.SSS  (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS
                               is thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maxi-
                               mum  value:  86399.999). If you don't specify a
                               value, Elastic Transcoder starts at the  begin-
                               ning of the input file.

                            Duration -> (string)
                               The  duration  of  the  clip. The format can be
                               either     HH:mm:ss.SSS     (maximum     value:
                               23:59:59.999;  SSS  is thousandths of a second)
                               or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you
                               don't  specify a value, Elastic Transcoder cre-
                               ates an output file from StartTime to  the  end
                               of the file.

                               If you specify a value longer than the duration
                               of   the   input   file,   Elastic   Transcoder
                               transcodes  the file and returns a warning mes-
                               sage.

                 Captions -> (structure)
                     You can configure Elastic Transcoder  to  transcode  cap-
                     tions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All cap-
                     tions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder  supports  two
                     types of captions:

                     o Embedded:  Embedded  captions  are included in the same
                       file as the audio and video.  Elastic  Transcoder  sup-
                       ports only one embedded caption per language, to a max-
                       imum of 300 embedded captions  per  file.  Valid  input
                       values  include:  CEA-608  (EIA-608  ,  first non-empty
                       channel only), CEA-708 (EIA-708 , first non-empty chan-
                       nel   only),  and  mov-text    Valid  outputs  include:
                       mov-text   Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one
                       embedded format per output.

                     o Sidecar:  Sidecar captions are kept in a separate meta-
                       data file from the audio and video data.  Sidecar  cap-
                       tions require a player that is capable of understanding
                       the relationship between the video file and the sidecar
                       file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar cap-
                       tion per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar  captions
                       per  file.  Valid input values include: dfxp (first div
                       element only), ebu-tt , scc , smpt , srt , ttml  (first
                       div  element only), and webvtt   Valid outputs include:
                       dfxp (first div element only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                     If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify
                     dfxp as your output format.

                     Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical  Charac-
                     ter  Recognition),  does  not  accept pictures as a valid
                     input for captions, and is not available  for  audio-only
                     transcoding.  Elastic  Transcoder  does not preserve text
                     formatting (for example, italics) during the  transcoding
                     process.

                     To  remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Cap-
                     tions  to  null.  To  pass  through   existing   captions
                     unchanged,  set the MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and pass
                     in a null CaptionSources array.

                     MergePolicy -> (string)
                        A policy that determines how Elastic  Transcoder  han-
                        dles the existence of multiple captions.

                        o MergeOverride:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes both
                          embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If  cap-
                          tions  for a language are embedded in the input file
                          and  also  appear  in  a   sidecar   file,   Elastic
                          Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the
                          embedded captions for that language.

                        o MergeRetain:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes   both
                          embedded  and sidecar captions into outputs. If cap-
                          tions for a language are embedded in the input  file
                          and   also   appear   in  a  sidecar  file,  Elastic
                          Transcoder uses the embedded  captions  and  ignores
                          the  sidecar captions for that language. If Caption-
                          Sources is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all side-
                          car captions from the output files.

                        o Override:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes  only the
                          sidecar captions that you specify in  CaptionSources
                          .
                            MergePolicy cannot be null.

                     CaptionSources -> (list)
                        Source  files for the input sidecar captions used dur-
                        ing the transcoding process. To omit all sidecar  cap-
                        tions, leave CaptionSources blank.

                        (structure)
                            A  source file for the input sidecar captions used
                            during the transcoding process.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The name of the sidecar caption file  that  you
                               want  Elastic Transcoder to include in the out-
                               put file.

                            Language -> (string)
                               A string that specifies  the  language  of  the
                               caption.  If you specified multiple inputs with
                               captions, the caption language  must  match  in
                               order  to  be  included  in the output. Specify
                               this as one of:

                               o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                               o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                               For more information on ISO language codes  and
                               language  names,  see  the  List  of  ISO 639-1
                               codes.

                            TimeOffset -> (string)
                               For clip generation or  captions  that  do  not
                               start  at the same time as the associated video
                               file, the TimeOffset tells  Elastic  Transcoder
                               how  much of the video to encode before includ-
                               ing captions.

                               Specify the TimeOffset in the  form  [+-]SS.sss
                               or [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                            Label -> (string)
                               The  label  of  the caption shown in the player
                               when choosing a language. We recommend that you
                               put the caption language name here, in the lan-
                               guage of the captions.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               The encryption settings, if any,  that  Elastic
                               Transcoder   needs   to  decyrpt  your  caption
                               sources, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                               apply to your caption sources.

                               Mode -> (string)
                                   The  specific  server-side  encryption mode
                                   that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use
                                   when   decrypting   your   input  files  or
                                   encrypting  your  output   files.   Elastic
                                   Transcoder supports the following options:

                                   o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates  and manages the
                                     keys used for encrypting your files.

                                   o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3  calls  the  Amazon
                                     Key Management Service, which creates and
                                     manages  the  keys  that  are  used   for
                                     encrypting  your  files.  If  you specify
                                     s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use  the
                                     default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key
                                     that you want to use to your pipeline.

                                   o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode
                                     of  operation  originally  used  for  HLS
                                     files.

                                   o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                                   o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode
                                     of  operation  that  is  an authenticated
                                     encryption format, meaning that  a  file,
                                     key,  or  initialization  vector that has
                                     been tampered with fails  the  decryption
                                     process.

                                   For all three AES options, you must provide
                                   the  following  settings,  which  must   be
                                   base64-encoded:

                                   o Key

                                   o Key MD5

                                   o Initialization Vector

                                   WARNING:
                                      For  the AES modes, your private encryp-
                                      tion keys and your unencrypted data  are
                                      never  stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is
                                      important that you  safely  manage  your
                                      encryption  keys.  If you lose them, you
                                      won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The data encryption key that you want Elas-
                                   tic  Transcoder to use to encrypt your out-
                                   put file, or that was used to encrypt  your
                                   input  file. The key must be base64-encoded
                                   and it must be one  of  the  following  bit
                                   lengths before being base64-encoded:
                                      128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                   The key must also be encrypted by using the
                                   Amazon Key Management Service.

                               KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                   The MD5 digest of the key that you used  to
                                   encrypt  your  input file, or that you want
                                   Elastic Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your
                                   output  file.  Elastic  Transcoder uses the
                                   key digest as a checksum to make sure  your
                                   key  was  not corrupted in transit. The key
                                   MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must  be
                                   exactly   16   bytes   long   before  being
                                   base64-encoded.

                               InitializationVector -> (string)
                                   The series of random bits created by a ran-
                                   dom bit generator, unique for every encryp-
                                   tion operation, that you  used  to  encrypt
                                   your  input  files or that you want Elastic
                                   Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output
                                   files.  The  initialization  vector must be
                                   base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16
                                   bytes long before being base64-encoded.

                     CaptionFormats -> (list)
                        The  array of file formats for the output captions. If
                        you leave this value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns
                        an error.

                        (structure)
                            The  file  format  of  the output captions. If you
                            leave this value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns
                            an error.

                            Format -> (string)
                               The format you specify determines whether Elas-
                               tic Transcoder generates an embedded or sidecar
                               caption for this output.

                               o Valid Embedded Caption Formats:

                                 o for FLAC : None

                                 o For MP3 : None

                                 o For MP4 : mov-text

                               o Valid   Sidecar   Caption   Formats:  Elastic
                                 Transcoder supports dfxp (first  div  element
                                 only), scc, srt, and webvtt. If you want ttml
                                 or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp
                                 as your output format.

                                 o For FMP4 : dfxp

                                 o Non-FMP4 outputs : All sidecar types
                                   fmp4 captions have an extension of .ismt

                            Pattern -> (string)
                               The  prefix  for caption filenames, in the form
                               description -{language} , where:

                               o description is a description of the video.

                               o {language} is a literal  value  that  Elastic
                                 Transcoder   replaces   with   the   two-  or
                                 three-letter code for  the  language  of  the
                                 caption in the output file names.

                               If  you  don't  include  {language} in the file
                               name pattern, Elastic Transcoder  automatically
                               appends  "{language}  "  to  the value that you
                               specify for the description. In addition, Elas-
                               tic  Transcoder automatically appends the count
                               to the end of the segment files.

                               For example, suppose  you're  transcoding  into
                               srt   format.   When  you  enter  "Sydney-{lan-
                               guage}-sunrise", and the language of  the  cap-
                               tions  is  English  (en), the name of the first
                               caption file is be  Sydney-en-sunrise00000.srt.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               The  encryption settings, if any, that you want
                               Elastic Transcoder to  apply  to  your  caption
                               formats.

                               Mode -> (string)
                                   The  specific  server-side  encryption mode
                                   that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use
                                   when   decrypting   your   input  files  or
                                   encrypting  your  output   files.   Elastic
                                   Transcoder supports the following options:

                                   o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates  and manages the
                                     keys used for encrypting your files.

                                     encrypting  your  files.  If  you specify
                                     s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use  the
                                     default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key
                                     that you want to use to your pipeline.

                                   o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode

                                     of  operation  that  is  an authenticated
                                     encryption format, meaning that  a  file,
                                     key,  or  initialization  vector that has
                                     been tampered with fails  the  decryption

                                   For all three AES options, you must provide
                                   the  following  settings,  which  must   be
                                   base64-encoded:

                                   o Key

                                   o Key MD5

                                   WARNING:
                                      For  the AES modes, your private encryp-
                                      tion keys and your unencrypted data  are
                                      never  stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is
                                      important that you  safely  manage  your
                                      encryption  keys.  If you lose them, you
                                      won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The data encryption key that you want Elas-
                                   tic  Transcoder to use to encrypt your out-
                                   put file, or that was used to encrypt  your
                                   input  file. The key must be base64-encoded
                                   and it must be one  of  the  following  bit
                                   lengths before being base64-encoded:
                                      128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                   The key must also be encrypted by using the
                                   Amazon Key Management Service.

                               KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                   The MD5 digest of the key that you used  to
                                   encrypt  your  input file, or that you want
                                   Elastic Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your
                                   output  file.  Elastic  Transcoder uses the
                                   key digest as a checksum to make sure  your
                                   key  was  not corrupted in transit. The key
                                   MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must  be
                                   exactly   16   bytes   long   before  being
                                   base64-encoded.

                               InitializationVector -> (string)
                                   The series of random bits created by a ran-
                                   dom bit generator, unique for every encryp-
                                   tion operation, that you  used  to  encrypt
                                   your  input  files or that you want Elastic
                                   Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output
                                   files.  The  initialization  vector must be
                                   base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16
                                   bytes long before being base64-encoded.

                 Encryption -> (structure)
                     The  encryption  settings,  if any, that you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to apply to your output files. If  you  choose
                     to use encryption, you must specify a mode to use. If you
                     choose not to use encryption, Elastic  Transcoder  writes
                     an unencrypted file to your Amazon S3 bucket.

                     Mode -> (string)
                        The specific server-side encryption mode that you want
                        Elastic Transcoder to use when decrypting  your  input
                        files   or   encrypting  your  output  files.  Elastic
                        Transcoder supports the following options:

                        o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used  for
                          encrypting your files.

                          that  are  used  for  encrypting  your files. If you
                          specify s3-aws-kms and you don't  want  to  use  the
                          default  key,  you must add the AWS-KMS key that you
                          want to use to your pipeline.

                        o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of  opera-

                        The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                        Management Service.

                     KeyMd5 -> (string)
                        The  MD5  digest  of  the key that you used to encrypt
                        your input file, or that you want  Elastic  Transcoder
                        to use to encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder

                     InitializationVector -> (string)
                        The series of random bits created by a random bit gen-
                        erator, unique for every  encryption  operation,  that

                        before being base64-encoded.

                 AppliedColorSpaceConversion -> (string)
                     If Elastic Transcoder used a preset with a ColorSpaceCon-
                     versionMode to transcode the output file, the AppliedCol-
                     orSpaceConversion parameter shows the conversion used. If
                     no ColorSpaceConversionMode was defined  in  the  preset,
                     this parameter is not be included in the job response.

              Outputs -> (list)
                 Information about the output files. We recommend that you use
                 the Outputs syntax for all jobs, even when you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder  to  transcode a file into only one format. Do not
                 use both the Outputs and Output syntaxes in the same request.
                 You can create a maximum of 30 outputs per job.

                 If  you  specify  more  than  one  output  for a job, Elastic
                 Transcoder creates the files for each output in the order  in
                 which you specify them in the job.

                 (structure)

                     WARNING:
                        Outputs recommended instead.

                     If  you specified one output for a job, information about
                     that output. If you specified multiple outputs for a job,
                     the  Output object lists information about the first out-
                     put. This duplicates the information that is  listed  for
                     the first output in the Outputs object.

                     Id -> (string)
                        A sequential counter, starting with 1, that identifies
                        an output among the outputs from the current  job.  In
                        the Output syntax, this value is always 1.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  name  to  assign  to the transcoded file. Elastic
                        Transcoder saves the file  in  the  Amazon  S3  bucket
                        specified  by  the OutputBucket object in the pipeline
                        that is specified by the pipeline ID.

                     ThumbnailPattern -> (string)
                        Whether you want Elastic Transcoder to  create  thumb-
                        nails for your videos and, if so, how you want Elastic
                        Transcoder to name the files.

                        If you don't want Elastic Transcoder to create  thumb-
                        nails, specify "".

                        If  you  do  want  Elastic Transcoder to create thumb-
                        nails,  specify  the  information  that  you  want  to
                        include  in  the file name for each thumbnail. You can
                        specify the following values in any sequence:

                        o ``{count}`` (Required)  :  If  you  want  to  create
                          thumbnails,  you  must include {count} in the Thumb-
                          nailPattern object. Wherever you specify  {count}  ,
                          Elastic Transcoder adds a five-digit sequence number
                          (beginning with 00001 ) to thumbnail file names. The
                          number  indicates where a given thumbnail appears in
                          the sequence of thumbnails for a transcoded file.

                        WARNING:
                            If you specify a literal value and/or {resolution}
                            but  you omit {count} , Elastic Transcoder returns
                            a validation error and does not create the job.

                        o Literal values (Optional) : You can specify  literal
                          values  anywhere in the ThumbnailPattern object. For
                          example, you can include them as a file name  prefix
                          or as a delimiter between {resolution} and {count} .

                        o ``{resolution}`` (Optional) : If  you  want  Elastic
                          Transcoder  to  include  the  resolution in the file
                          name, include {resolution} in  the  ThumbnailPattern
                          object.

                        When creating thumbnails, Elastic Transcoder automati-
                        cally saves the files in the  format  (.jpg  or  .png)
                        that  appears  in the preset that you specified in the
                        PresetID value of CreateJobOutput . Elastic Transcoder
                        also appends the applicable file name extension.

                     ThumbnailEncryption -> (structure)
                        The encryption settings, if any, that you want Elastic
                        Transcoder to apply to your thumbnail.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            The specific server-side encryption mode that  you
                            want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use when decrypting
                            your input files or encrypting your output  files.
                            Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:

                            o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys  used
                              for encrypting your files.

                            o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Man-
                              agement Service, which creates and  manages  the
                              keys that are used for encrypting your files. If
                              you specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use
                              the  default  key,  you must add the AWS-KMS key
                              that you want to use to your pipeline.

                            o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A  padded  cipher-block  mode  of

                              operation that is  an  authenticated  encryption
                              format, meaning that a file, key, or initializa-
                              tion vector that has been  tampered  with  fails
                              the decryption process.

                            For  all  three  AES options, you must provide the
                            following settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                            o Key

                            o Key MD5

                            o Initialization Vector

                            WARNING:
                               For the AES modes, your private encryption keys
                               and  your  unencrypted data are never stored by
                               AWS; therefore, it is important that you safely
                               manage  your encryption keys. If you lose them,
                               you won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The data encryption  key  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file, or
                            that was used to encrypt your input file. The  key
                            must  be  base64-encoded and it must be one of the
                            following bit lengths before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                            The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon
                            Key Management Service.

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt
                            your   input   file,  or  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output  file.
                            Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a check-
                            sum to make sure your key  was  not  corrupted  in
                            transit.  The  key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and
                            it must be exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                            base64-encoded.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            The  series of random bits created by a random bit
                            generator, unique for every encryption  operation,
                            that  you used to encrypt your input files or that
                            you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your
                            output  files.  The  initialization vector must be
                            base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16  bytes
                            long before being base64-encoded.

                     Rotate -> (string)
                        The  number  of  degrees  clockwise  by which you want
                        Elastic Transcoder to rotate the  output  relative  to
                        the input. Enter one of the following values:
                            auto , 0 , 90 , 180 , 270

                        The  value  auto generally works only if the file that
                        you're transcoding contains rotation metadata.

                     PresetId -> (string)
                        The value of the Id object for  the  preset  that  you
                        want  to  use  for this job. The preset determines the
                        audio, video,  and  thumbnail  settings  that  Elastic
                        Transcoder  uses for transcoding. To use a preset that
                        you  created,  specify  the  preset  ID  that  Elastic
                        Transcoder  returned  in the response when you created
                        the preset. You can also use  the  Elastic  Transcoder
                        system presets, which you can get with ListPresets .

                     SegmentDuration -> (string)

                        WARNING:
                            (Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.

                        If you specify a preset  in  PresetId  for  which  the
                        value  of  Container  is  fmp4  (Fragmented MP4) or ts
                        (MPEG-TS), SegmentDuration is the target maximum dura-
                        tion  of  each  segment  in  seconds. For HLSv3 format
                        playlists, each media segment is stored in a  separate
                        .ts   file.   For  HLSv4  ,  MPEG-DASH  ,  and  Smooth
                        playlists, all media segments for an output are stored
                        in  a  single  file. Each segment is approximately the
                        length of the SegmentDuration , though individual seg-
                        ments might be shorter or longer.

                        The  range  of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the
                        duration of the video is not evenly divisible by  Seg-
                        mentDuration , the duration of the last segment is the
                        remainder of total length/SegmentDuration.

                        Elastic Transcoder creates an output-specific playlist
                        for  each  output  HLS output that you specify in Out-
                        putKeys. To add an output to the master  playlist  for
                        this  job, include it in the OutputKeys of the associ-
                        ated playlist.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The status of one output in a job.  If  you  specified
                        only  one output for the job, Outputs:Status is always
                        the same as Job:Status . If you  specified  more  than
                        one output:

                        o Job:Status and Outputs:Status for all of the outputs
                          is Submitted  until  Elastic  Transcoder  starts  to
                          process the first output.

                        o When  Elastic Transcoder starts to process the first
                          output, Outputs:Status for that output and  Job:Sta-
                          tus both change to Progressing. For each output, the
                          value  of  Outputs:Status  remains  Submitted  until
                          Elastic Transcoder starts to process the output.

                        o Job:Status remains Progressing until all of the out-
                          puts reach a terminal  status,  either  Complete  or
                          Error.

                        o When  all  of  the  outputs reach a terminal status,
                          Job:Status changes to Complete only if  Outputs:Sta-
                          tus  for  all  of  the outputs is Complete . If Out-
                          puts:Status for one or more outputs is Error  ,  the
                          terminal status for Job:Status is also Error .

                        The value of Status is one of the following: Submitted
                        , Progressing , Complete , Canceled , or Error .

                     StatusDetail -> (string)
                        Information that further explains Status .

                     Duration -> (long)
                        Duration of the output file, in seconds.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Specifies the width of the output file in pixels.

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Height of the output file, in pixels.

                     FrameRate -> (string)
                        Frame rate of the output file, in frames per second.

                     FileSize -> (long)
                        File size of the output file, in bytes.

                     DurationMillis -> (long)
                        Duration of the output file, in milliseconds.

                     Watermarks -> (list)
                        Information about the watermarks that you want Elastic
                        Transcoder to add to the video during transcoding. You
                        can specify up to four  watermarks  for  each  output.
                        Settings  for  each  watermark  must be defined in the
                        preset that you specify in Preset for the current out-
                        put.

                        Watermarks  are  added  to  the  output  video  in the
                        sequence in which you list them in the  job  outputthe
                        first  watermark  in  the  list is added to the output
                        video first, the second watermark in the list is added
                        next,  and  so  on.  As a result, if the settings in a
                        preset cause Elastic Transcoder to  place  all  water-
                        marks  in the same location, the second watermark that
                        you add covers the first one, the third one covers the
                        second, and the fourth one covers the third.

                        (structure)
                            Watermarks  can  be in .png or .jpg format. If you
                            want to display a watermark that is not  rectangu-
                            lar,  use  the  .png format, which supports trans-
                            parency.

                            PresetWatermarkId -> (string)
                               The ID of the watermark settings  that  Elastic
                               Transcoder  uses to add watermarks to the video
                               during transcoding. The  settings  are  in  the
                               preset specified by Preset for the current out-
                               put. In that preset, the value of Watermarks Id
                               tells Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.

                            InputKey -> (string)
                               The name of the .png or .jpg file that you want
                               to  use  for  the watermark. To determine which
                               Amazon S3 bucket contains the  specified  file,
                               Elastic  Transcoder  checks the pipeline speci-
                               fied by Pipeline ; the Input Bucket  object  in
                               that pipeline identifies the bucket.

                               If  the  file name includes a prefix, for exam-
                               ple, logos/128x64.png , include the  prefix  in
                               the  key.  If  the  file isn't in the specified
                               bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               The encryption settings, if any, that you  want
                               Elastic Transcoder to apply to your watermarks.

                               Mode -> (string)
                                   The specific  server-side  encryption  mode
                                   that  you  want  Elastic  Transcoder to use
                                   when  decrypting  your   input   files   or
                                   encrypting   your   output  files.  Elastic
                                   Transcoder supports the following options:

                                   o s3: Amazon S3  creates  and  manages  the
                                     keys used for encrypting your files.

                                   o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3  calls the Amazon
                                     Key Management Service, which creates and
                                     manages   the  keys  that  are  used  for
                                     encrypting your  files.  If  you  specify
                                     s3-aws-kms  and you don't want to use the
                                     default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key
                                     that you want to use to your pipeline.

                                   o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode
                                     of  operation  originally  used  for  HLS
                                     files.

                                   o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                                   o aes-gcm:  AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode
                                     of operation  that  is  an  authenticated
                                     encryption  format,  meaning that a file,
                                     key, or initialization  vector  that  has
                                     been  tampered  with fails the decryption
                                     process.

                                   For all three AES options, you must provide
                                   the   following  settings,  which  must  be
                                   base64-encoded:

                                   o Key

                                   o Key MD5

                                   o Initialization Vector

                                      128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                   The key must also be encrypted by using the
                                   Amazon Key Management Service.

                               KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                   The  MD5 digest of the key that you used to
                                   encrypt your input file, or that  you  want
                                   Elastic  Transcoder  to use to encrypt your
                                   output file. Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the
                                   key  digest as a checksum to make sure your
                                   key was not corrupted in transit.  The  key
                                   MD5  must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                                   exactly  16   bytes   long   before   being
                                   base64-encoded.

                               InitializationVector -> (string)
                                   The series of random bits created by a ran-
                                   dom bit generator, unique for every encryp-
                                   tion  operation,  that  you used to encrypt
                                   your input files or that you  want  Elastic
                                   Transcoder  to  use  to encrypt your output
                                   files. The initialization  vector  must  be
                                   base64-encoded,  and  it must be exactly 16
                                   bytes long before being base64-encoded.

                     AlbumArt -> (structure)
                        The album art to be associated with the  output  file,
                        if any.

                        MergePolicy -> (string)
                            A  policy  that  determines how Elastic Transcoder
                            handles the existence of  multiple  album  artwork
                            files.

                            o Replace:  The  specified  album art replaces any
                              existing album art.

                            o Prepend: The specified album art  is  placed  in
                              front of any existing album art.

                            o Append:  The specified album art is placed after
                              any existing album art.

                            o Fallback: If the original  input  file  contains
                              artwork,  Elastic  Transcoder  uses that artwork
                              for the output. If the original input  does  not
                              contain  artwork,  Elastic  Transcoder  uses the
                              specified album art file.

                        Artwork -> (list)
                            The file to be used as album  art.  There  can  be
                            multiple  artworks  associated with an audio file,
                            to a maximum of 20. Valid  formats  are  .jpg  and
                            .png

                            (structure)
                               The  file to be used as album art. There can be
                               multiple  artworks  associated  with  an  audio
                               file, to a maximum of 20.

                               To  remove  artwork or leave the artwork empty,
                               you can either set Artwork to null, or set  the
                               Merge Policy to "Replace" and use an empty Art-
                               work array.

                               To pass through existing artwork unchanged, set
                               the  Merge  Policy  to  "Prepend", "Append", or
                               "Fallback", and use an empty Artwork array.

                               InputKey -> (string)
                                   The name of the file to be  used  as  album
                                   art.  To  determine  which Amazon S3 bucket
                                   contains  the   specified   file,   Elastic
                                   Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by
                                   PipelineId ; the InputBucket object in that
                                   pipeline identifies the bucket.

                                   If  the  file  name  includes a prefix, for
                                   example, cooking/pie.jpg , include the pre-
                                   fix  in  the  key. If the file isn't in the
                                   specified   bucket,   Elastic    Transcoder
                                   returns an error.

                               MaxWidth -> (string)
                                   The  maximum  width of the output album art
                                   in pixels. If you specify  auto  ,  Elastic
                                   Transcoder  uses  600 as the default value.
                                   If you specify a numeric  value,  enter  an
                                   even  integer  between  32 and 4096, inclu-
                                   sive.

                               MaxHeight -> (string)
                                   The maximum height of the output album  art
                                   in  pixels.  If  you specify auto , Elastic
                                   Transcoder uses 600 as the  default  value.
                                   If  you  specify  a numeric value, enter an
                                   even integer between 32  and  3072,  inclu-
                                   sive.

                               SizingPolicy -> (string)
                                   Specify one of the following values to con-
                                   trol scaling of the output album art:

                                   o Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output
                                     art  so  it  matches  the  value that you
                                     specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight
                                     without exceeding the other value.

                                   o Fill:  Elastic Transcoder scales the out-
                                     put art so it matches the value that  you
                                     specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight
                                     and matches or exceeds the  other  value.
                                     Elastic Transcoder centers the output art
                                     and then crops it in  the  dimension  (if
                                     any) that exceeds the maximum value.

                                   o Stretch: Elastic Transcoder stretches the
                                     output art to match the values  that  you
                                     specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight . If
                                     the relative proportions of the input art
                                     and  the  output  art  are different, the
                                     output art will be distorted.

                                   o Keep: Elastic Transcoder does  not  scale
                                     the  output  art.  If either dimension of
                                     the input art exceeds the values that you
                                     specified  for  MaxWidth  and MaxHeight ,
                                     Elastic Transcoder crops the output  art.

                                   o ShrinkToFit:  Elastic  Transcoder  scales
                                     the output art down so  that  its  dimen-
                                     sions match the values that you specified
                                     for at least one  of  MaxWidth  and  Max-
                                     Height without exceeding either value. If
                                     you   specify   this   option,    Elastic
                                     Transcoder does not scale the art up.

                                   o ShrinkToFill  Elastic  Transcoder  scales
                                     the output art down so  that  its  dimen-
                                     sions match the values that you specified
                                     for at least one  of  MaxWidth  and  Max-
                                     Height   without  dropping  below  either
                                     value. If you specify this option,  Elas-
                                     tic Transcoder does not scale the art up.

                               PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                                   When you set PaddingPolicy to Pad , Elastic
                                   Transcoder  may  add  white bars to the top
                                   and bottom and/or left and right  sides  of
                                   the output album art to make the total size
                                   of the output art match the values that you
                                   specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight .

                               AlbumArtFormat -> (string)
                                   The format of album art, if any. Valid for-
                                   mats are .jpg and .png .

                               Encryption -> (structure)
                                   The encryption settings, if any,  that  you
                                   want  Elastic  Transcoder  to apply to your
                                   artwork.

                                   Mode -> (string)
                                      The specific server-side encryption mode
                                      that  you want Elastic Transcoder to use
                                      when  decrypting  your  input  files  or
                                      encrypting  your  output  files. Elastic
                                      Transcoder   supports   the    following
                                      options:

                                      o s3:  Amazon S3 creates and manages the
                                        keys used for encrypting your files.

                                      o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon
                                        Key  Management Service, which creates
                                        and manages the keys that are used for
                                        encrypting  your files. If you specify
                                        s3-aws-kms and you don't want  to  use
                                        the  default  key,  you  must  add the
                                        AWS-KMS key that you want  to  use  to
                                        your pipeline.

                                      o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A  padded cipher-block
                                        mode of operation originally used  for
                                        HLS files.

                                      o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                                      o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois  Counter Mode, a
                                        mode of operation that is an authenti-
                                        cated  encryption format, meaning that
                                        a file, key, or initialization  vector
                                        that  has been tampered with fails the
                                        decryption process.

                                      For all three AES options, you must pro-
                                      vide  the following settings, which must
                                      be base64-encoded:

                                      o Key

                                      o Key MD5

                                      o Initialization Vector

                                      WARNING:
                                          For  the  AES  modes,  your  private

                                          data are never stored by AWS; there-
                                          fore,   it  is  important  that  you
                                          safely manage your encryption  keys.
                                          If  you lose them, you won't be able

                                      Elastic  Transcoder  to  use  to encrypt
                                      your output file, or that  was  used  to
                                      encrypt your input file. The key must be
                                      base64-encoded and it must be one of the
                                      following   bit   lengths  before  being
                                      base64-encoded:
                                          128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                      The key must also be encrypted by  using
                                      the Amazon Key Management Service.

                                   KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                      The  MD5 digest of the key that you used
                                      to encrypt your input file, or that  you
                                      want   Elastic   Transcoder  to  use  to
                                      encrypt  your   output   file.   Elastic
                                      Transcoder  uses  the  key  digest  as a
                                      checksum to make sure your key  was  not
                                      corrupted  in  transit. The key MD5 must
                                      be  base64-encoded,  and  it   must   be
                                      exactly   16  bytes  long  before  being
                                      base64-encoded.

                                   InitializationVector -> (string)
                                      The series of random bits created  by  a
                                      random  bit  generator, unique for every
                                      encryption operation, that you  used  to
                                      encrypt  your  input  files  or that you
                                      want  Elastic  Transcoder  to   use   to
                                      encrypt  your output files. The initial-
                                      ization vector must  be  base64-encoded,
                                      and  it  must  be  exactly 16 bytes long
                                      before being base64-encoded.

                     Composition -> (list)
                        You can create an output file that contains an excerpt
                        from  the input file. This excerpt, called a clip, can
                        come from the beginning, middle, or end of  the  file.
                        The Composition object contains settings for the clips
                        that make up an output file. For the current  release,
                        you  can  only  specify settings for a single clip per
                        output file. The Composition object cannot be null.

                        (structure)
                            Settings for one clip in a composition.  All  jobs
                            in a playlist must have the same clip settings.

                            TimeSpan -> (structure)
                               Settings  that determine when a clip begins and
                               how long it lasts.

                               StartTime -> (string)
                                   The place in the input file where you  want
                                   a  clip  to start. The format can be either
                                   HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value:  23:59:59.999;
                                   SSS   is   thousandths   of  a  second)  or
                                   sssss.SSS (maximum  value:  86399.999).  If
                                   you   don't   specify   a   value,  Elastic
                                   Transcoder starts at the beginning  of  the
                                   input file.

                               Duration -> (string)
                                   The duration of the clip. The format can be
                                   either   HH:mm:ss.SSS    (maximum    value:
                                   23:59:59.999;  SSS is thousandths of a sec-
                                   ond)   or   sssss.SSS    (maximum    value:
                                   86399.999).  If  you don't specify a value,
                                   Elastic Transcoder creates an  output  file
                                   from StartTime to the end of the file.

                                   If  you  specify  a  value  longer than the
                                   duration  of  the   input   file,   Elastic
                                   Transcoder  transcodes the file and returns
                                   a warning message.

                     Captions -> (structure)
                        You can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode cap-
                        tions,  or  subtitles, from one format to another. All
                        captions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports
                        two types of captions:

                        o Embedded: Embedded captions are included in the same
                          file as the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder sup-
                          ports  only  one embedded caption per language, to a
                          maximum of 300 embedded  captions  per  file.  Valid
                          input  values  include:  CEA-608  (EIA-608  ,  first
                          non-empty channel only), CEA-708  (EIA-708  ,  first
                          non-empty  channel  only), and mov-text   Valid out-
                          puts include: mov-text   Elastic Transcoder supports
                          a maximum of one embedded format per output.

                        o Sidecar:  Sidecar  captions  are  kept in a separate
                          metadata file from the audio and video data. Sidecar
                          captions  require a player that is capable of under-
                          standing the relationship between the video file and
                          the  sidecar  file. Elastic Transcoder supports only
                          one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20
                          sidecar   captions  per  file.  Valid  input  values
                          include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt , scc
                          ,  smpt  ,  srt , ttml (first div element only), and
                          webvtt   Valid outputs include: dfxp (first div ele-
                          ment only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                        If  you  want  ttml  or  smpte-tt compatible captions,
                        specify dfxp as your output format.

                        Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Char-
                        acter  Recognition),  does  not  accept  pictures as a
                        valid input for captions, and  is  not  available  for
                        audio-only  transcoding.  Elastic  Transcoder does not
                        preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during
                        the transcoding process.

                        To  remove  captions  or leave the captions empty, set
                        Captions to null. To pass  through  existing  captions
                        unchanged,  set  the  MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and
                        pass in a null CaptionSources array.

                        For more information on embedded files, see the Subti-
                        tles Wikipedia page.

                        For  more information on sidecar files, see the Exten-
                        sible Metadata Platform  and  Sidecar  file  Wikipedia
                        pages.

                        MergePolicy -> (string)
                            A  policy  that  determines how Elastic Transcoder
                            handles the existence of multiple captions.

                            o MergeOverride:  Elastic  Transcoder   transcodes
                              both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs.
                              If captions for a language are embedded  in  the
                              input  file  and  also appear in a sidecar file,
                              Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and
                              ignores the embedded captions for that language.

                            o MergeRetain: Elastic Transcoder transcodes  both
                              embedded  and  sidecar captions into outputs. If
                              captions for a  language  are  embedded  in  the
                              input  file  and  also appear in a sidecar file,
                              Elastic Transcoder uses  the  embedded  captions
                              and  ignores  the sidecar captions for that lan-
                              guage.  If  CaptionSources  is  empty,   Elastic
                              Transcoder  omits  all sidecar captions from the
                              output files.

                            o Override: Elastic Transcoder transcodes only the
                              sidecar  captions  that  you specify in Caption-
                              Sources .
                               MergePolicy cannot be null.

                        CaptionSources -> (list)
                            Source files for the input sidecar  captions  used
                            during  the transcoding process. To omit all side-
                            car captions, leave CaptionSources blank.

                            (structure)
                               A source file for the  input  sidecar  captions
                               used during the transcoding process.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  name  of the sidecar caption file that
                                   you want Elastic Transcoder to  include  in
                                   the output file.

                               Language -> (string)
                                   A string that specifies the language of the
                                   caption. If you specified  multiple  inputs
                                   with  captions,  the  caption language must
                                   match in order to be included in  the  out-
                                   put. Specify this as one of:

                                   o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                                   o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                                   For  more information on ISO language codes
                                   and language names, see  the  List  of  ISO
                                   639-1 codes.

                               TimeOffset -> (string)
                                   For clip generation or captions that do not
                                   start at the same time  as  the  associated
                                   video  file,  the  TimeOffset tells Elastic
                                   Transcoder how much of the video to  encode
                                   before including captions.

                                   Specify   the   TimeOffset   in   the  form
                                   [+-]SS.sss or [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                               Label -> (string)
                                   The label  of  the  caption  shown  in  the
                                   player  when choosing a language. We recom-
                                   mend that you put the caption language name
                                   here, in the language of the captions.

                               Encryption -> (structure)
                                   The encryption settings, if any, that Elas-
                                   tic Transcoder needs to decyrpt  your  cap-
                                   tion  sources,  or  that  you  want Elastic
                                   Transcoder  to  apply   to   your   caption
                                   sources.

                                   Mode -> (string)
                                      The specific server-side encryption mode
                                      that you want Elastic Transcoder to  use
                                      when  decrypting  your  input  files  or
                                      encrypting your  output  files.  Elastic
                                      Transcoder    supports   the   following
                                      options:

                                      o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages  the
                                        keys used for encrypting your files.

                                      o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon
                                        Key Management Service, which  creates
                                        and manages the keys that are used for
                                        encrypting your files. If you  specify

                                   form description -{language} , where:

                                   o description  is  a  description  of   the
                                     video.

                                   o {language}  is a literal value that Elas-
                                     tic Transcoder replaces with the two-  or
                                     three-letter code for the language of the
                                     caption in the output file names.

                                   If you don't include {language} in the file
                                   name  pattern, Elastic Transcoder automati-
                                   cally appends "{language} "  to  the  value
                                   that  you  specify  for the description. In
                                   addition, Elastic Transcoder  automatically
                                   appends the count to the end of the segment
                                   files.

                                   For  example,  suppose  you're  transcoding
                                   into  srt  format.  When  you  enter  "Syd-
                                   ney-{language}-sunrise", and  the  language
                                   of  the  captions is English (en), the name
                                   of  the  first  caption  file  is  be  Syd-
                                   ney-en-sunrise00000.srt.

                                      Transcoder uses  the  key  digest  as  a
                                      checksum  to  make sure your key was not
                                      corrupted in transit. The key  MD5  must
                                      be   base64-encoded,   and  it  must  be
                                      exactly  16  bytes  long  before   being
                                      base64-encoded.

                                   InitializationVector -> (string)
                                      The  series  of random bits created by a
                                      random bit generator, unique  for  every
                                      encryption  operation,  that you used to
                                      encrypt your input  files  or  that  you
                                      want   Elastic   Transcoder  to  use  to
                                      encrypt your output files. The  initial-
                                      ization  vector  must be base64-encoded,
                                      and it must be  exactly  16  bytes  long
                                      before being base64-encoded.

                     Encryption -> (structure)
                        The encryption settings, if any, that you want Elastic
                        Transcoder to apply  to  your  output  files.  If  you
                        choose  to  use encryption, you must specify a mode to
                        use. If you choose  not  to  use  encryption,  Elastic
                        Transcoder  writes  an unencrypted file to your Amazon
                        S3 bucket.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            The specific server-side encryption mode that  you
                            want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use when decrypting
                            your input files or encrypting your output  files.
                            Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:

                            o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys  used
                              for encrypting your files.

                            o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Man-
                              agement Service, which creates and  manages  the
                              keys that are used for encrypting your files. If
                              you specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use
                              the  default  key,  you must add the AWS-KMS key
                              that you want to use to your pipeline.

                            o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A  padded  cipher-block  mode  of
                              operation originally used for HLS files.

                            o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                            o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois  Counter  Mode,  a mode of
                              operation that is  an  authenticated  encryption
                              format, meaning that a file, key, or initializa-
                              tion vector that has been  tampered  with  fails
                              the decryption process.

                            For  all  three  AES options, you must provide the
                            following settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                            o Key

                            o Key MD5

                            o Initialization Vector

                            WARNING:
                               For the AES modes, your private encryption keys
                               and  your  unencrypted data are never stored by
                               AWS; therefore, it is important that you safely
                               manage  your encryption keys. If you lose them,
                               you won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The data encryption  key  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file, or
                            that was used to encrypt your input file. The  key
                            must  be  base64-encoded and it must be one of the
                            following bit lengths before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                            The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon
                            Key Management Service.

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt
                            your   input   file,  or  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output  file.
                            Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a check-
                            sum to make sure your key  was  not  corrupted  in
                            transit.  The  key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and
                            it must be exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                            base64-encoded.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            The  series of random bits created by a random bit
                            generator, unique for every encryption  operation,
                            that  you used to encrypt your input files or that
                            you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your
                            output  files.  The  initialization vector must be
                            base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16  bytes
                            long before being base64-encoded.

                     AppliedColorSpaceConversion -> (string)
                        If Elastic Transcoder used a preset with a ColorSpace-
                        ConversionMode  to  transcode  the  output  file,  the
                        AppliedColorSpaceConversion  parameter  shows the con-
                        version  used.  If  no  ColorSpaceConversionMode   was
                        defined  in  the  preset,  this  parameter  is  not be
                        included in the job response.

              OutputKeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The value, if  any,  that  you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to
                 prepend  to  the  names  of  all files that this job creates,
                 including output files, thumbnails, and playlists. We  recom-
                 mend  that  you add a / or some other delimiter to the end of
                 the OutputKeyPrefix .

              Playlists -> (list)

                 WARNING:
                     Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.

                 If you specify a preset in PresetId for which  the  value  of
                 Container is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), Playlists
                 contains information about the master playlists that you want
                 Elastic Transcoder to create.

                 The maximum number of master playlists in a job is 30.

                 (structure)
                     Use  Only  for  Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS Outputs. If you
                     specify a preset for which the value of Container is fmp4
                     (Fragmented  MP4)  or  ts  (MPEG-TS),  Playlists contains
                     information about the  master  playlists  that  you  want
                     Elastic  Transcoder to create. We recommend that you cre-
                     ate only one master playlist per output format. The maxi-
                     mum number of master playlists in a job is 30.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to
                        the master playlist, for  example,  nyc-vacation.m3u8.
                        If the name includes a / character, the section of the
                        name before the last / must be identical for all  Name
                        objects.  If you create more than one master playlist,
                        the values of all Name objects must be unique.

                        NOTE:
                            Elastic Transcoder automatically appends the rele-
                            vant  file  extension  to the file name (.m3u8 for
                            HLSv3 and HLSv4 playlists, and .ism and .ismc  for
                            Smooth playlists). If you include a file extension
                            in Name , the file name will have two  extensions.

                     Format -> (string)
                        The  format  of  the  output  playlist.  Valid formats
                        include HLSv3 , HLSv4 , and Smooth .

                     OutputKeys -> (list)
                        For each output in this job that you want  to  include
                        in  a  master  playlist,  the value of the Outputs:Key
                        object.

                        o If your output is not HLS or does not have a segment
                          duration  set, the name of the output file is a con-
                          catenation of OutputKeyPrefix and Outputs:Key : Out-
                          putKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key``

                        o If  your  output is HLSv3 and has a segment duration
                          set, or is  not  included  in  a  playlist,  Elastic
                          Transcoder  creates  an  output playlist file with a
                          file extension of .m3u8 , and a series of .ts  files
                          that  include a five-digit sequential counter begin-
                          ning  with   00000:   OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key``
                          .m3u8 OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key`` 00000.ts

                        o If  your  output  is  HLSv4 , has a segment duration
                          set, and is included in an HLSv4  playlist,  Elastic
                          Transcoder  creates  an  output playlist file with a
                          file extension of _v4.m3u8 . If the output is video,
                          Elastic  Transcoder also creates an output file with
                          an extension of _iframe.m3u8 : OutputKeyPrefix``Out-
                          puts:Key``  _v4.m3u8  OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key``
                          _iframe.m3u8 OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key`` .ts

                        Elastic Transcoder automatically appends the  relevant
                        file extension to the file name. If you include a file
                        extension in Output Key, the file name will  have  two
                        extensions.

                        If you include more than one output in a playlist, any
                        segment duration settings, clip settings,  or  caption
                        settings  must  be  the  same  for  all outputs in the
                        playlist. For Smooth playlists,  the  Audio:Profile  ,
                        Video:Profile     ,     and     Video:FrameRate     to
                        Video:KeyframesMaxDist ratio must be the same for  all
                        outputs.

                        (string)

                     HlsContentProtection -> (structure)
                        The  HLS content protection settings, if any, that you
                        want Elastic Transcoder to apply to the  output  files
                        associated with this playlist.

                        Method -> (string)
                            The content protection method for your output. The
                            only valid value is: aes-128 .

                            This value is written into the method attribute of
                            the EXT-X-KEY metadata tag in the output playlist.

                        Key -> (string)
                            If you want Elastic Transcoder to generate  a  key
                            for you, leave this field blank.

                            If  you  choose  to  supply your own key, you must
                            encrypt the key by using AWS KMS. The key must  be
                            base64-encoded,  and it must be one of the follow-
                            ing bit lengths before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            If Elastic Transcoder is generating your  key  for
                            you, you must leave this field blank.

                            The  MD5  digest  of the key that you want Elastic
                            Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file, and
                            that  you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use as a
                            checksum to make sure your key was  not  corrupted
                            in  transit.  The  key MD5 must be base64-encoded,
                            and it must  be  exactly  16  bytes  before  being
                            base64- encoded.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            If  Elastic  Transcoder is generating your key for
                            you, you must leave this field blank.

                            The series of random bits created by a random  bit
                            generator,  unique for every encryption operation,
                            that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt
                            your  output files. The initialization vector must
                            be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes
                            before being base64-encoded.

                        LicenseAcquisitionUrl -> (string)
                            The  location  of  the  license  key  required  to
                            decrypt your HLS playlist.  The  URL  must  be  an
                            absolute  path,  and  is  referenced  in  the  URI
                            attribute of the EXT-X-KEY  metadata  tag  in  the
                            playlist file.

                        KeyStoragePolicy -> (string)
                            Specify  whether  you  want  Elastic Transcoder to
                            write your HLS license key to an Amazon S3 bucket.
                            If you choose WithVariantPlaylists , LicenseAcqui-
                            sitionUrl  must  be   left   blank   and   Elastic
                            Transcoder  writes  your  data  key  into the same
                            bucket as the associated playlist.

                     PlayReadyDrm -> (structure)
                        The DRM  settings,  if  any,  that  you  want  Elastic
                        Transcoder  to  apply  to  the output files associated
                        with this playlist.

                        Format -> (string)
                            The type of DRM, if any,  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder to apply to the output files associated
                            with this playlist.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The DRM key for your file, provided  by  your  DRM
                            license  provider. The key must be base64-encoded,
                            and it must be one of the  following  bit  lengths
                            before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                            The key must also be encrypted by using AWS KMS.

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            The  MD5  digest  of  the key used for DRM on your
                            file, and that you want Elastic Transcoder to  use
                            as  a  checksum to make sure your key was not cor-
                            rupted  in  transit.   The   key   MD5   must   be
                            base64-encoded,  and  it  must be exactly 16 bytes
                            before being base64-encoded.

                        KeyId -> (string)
                            The ID for your DRM key, so that your DRM  license
                            provider knows which key to provide.

                            The  key  ID  must  be provided in big endian, and
                            Elastic Transcoder converts it  to  little  endian
                            before  inserting  it into the PlayReady DRM head-
                            ers. If you are unsure whether your license server
                            provides  your  key  ID  in  big or little endian,
                            check with your DRM provider.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            The series of random bits created by a random  bit
                            generator,  unique for every encryption operation,
                            that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt
                            your  files.  The  initialization  vector  must be
                            base64-encoded, and it must  be  exactly  8  bytes
                            long  before  being base64-encoded. If no initial-
                            ization vector  is  provided,  Elastic  Transcoder
                            generates one for you.

                        LicenseAcquisitionUrl -> (string)
                            The  location  of the license key required to play
                            DRM content. The URL must be an absolute path, and
                            is   referenced   by  the  PlayReady  header.  The
                            PlayReady header is referenced in  the  protection
                            header of the client manifest for Smooth Streaming
                            outputs, and in the EXT-X-DXDRM and EXT-XDXDRMINFO
                            metadata tags for HLS playlist outputs. An example
                            URL looks like this: https://www.example.com/exam-
                            pleKey/

                     Status -> (string)

              UserMetadata -> (map)
                 User-defined  metadata  that  you  want  to associate with an
                 Elastic Transcoder job. You  specify  metadata  in  key/value
                 pairs,  and  you  can  add  up to 10 key/value pairs per job.
                 Elastic Transcoder does not guarantee  that  key/value  pairs
                 are returned in the same order in which you specify them.

                 Metadata keys and values must use characters from the follow-
                 ing list:

                 o 0-9

                 o A-Z and a-z

                 o Space

                     The  time  the  job began transcoding, in epoch millisec-
                     onds.

                 FinishTimeMillis -> (long)
                     The time the job finished transcoding, in epoch millisec-
                     onds.

       NextPageToken -> (string)
          A  value  that  you use to access the second and subsequent pages of
          results, if any. When the jobs in the specified pipeline fit on  one
          page  or  when you've reached the last page of results, the value of
          NextPageToken is null .
