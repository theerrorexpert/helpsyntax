UPDATE-PIPELINE-STATUS()                              UPDATE-PIPELINE-STATUS()



NAME
       update-pipeline-status -

DESCRIPTION
       The UpdatePipelineStatus operation pauses or reactivates a pipeline, so
       that the pipeline stops or restarts the processing of jobs.

       Changing the pipeline status is useful if you want  to  cancel  one  or
       more  jobs.  You can't cancel jobs after Elastic Transcoder has started
       processing them; if you pause the pipeline to which you  submitted  the
       jobs,  you have more time to get the job IDs for the jobs that you want
       to cancel, and to send a  CancelJob request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-pipeline-status
          --id <value>
          --status <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the pipeline to update.

       --status (string)
          The desired status of the pipeline:

          o Active : The pipeline is processing jobs.

          o Paused : The pipeline is not currently processing jobs.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

OUTPUT
       Pipeline -> (structure)
          A  section  of the response body that provides information about the
          pipeline.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier for the pipeline. You use this value to  identify
              the  pipeline  in  which you want to perform a variety of opera-
              tions, such as creating a job or a preset.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the pipeline.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the pipeline. We recommend that the name  be  unique
              within the AWS account, but uniqueness is not enforced.

              Constraints: Maximum 40 characters

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the pipeline:

              o Active : The pipeline is processing jobs.

              o Paused : The pipeline is not currently processing jobs.

          InputBucket -> (string)
              The  Amazon  S3  bucket from which Elastic Transcoder gets media
              files for transcoding and the graphics files, if any,  that  you
              want to use for watermarks.

          OutputBucket -> (string)
              The  Amazon  S3  bucket  in which you want Elastic Transcoder to
              save transcoded files, thumbnails,  and  playlists.  Either  you
              specify this value, or you specify both ContentConfig and Thumb-
              nailConfig .

          Role -> (string)
              The IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  the  role  that  Elastic
              Transcoder uses to transcode jobs for this pipeline.

              If you use either s3 or s3-aws-kms as your Encryption:Mode , you
              don't need to provide a key with your job because a default key,
              known as an AWS-KMS key, is created for you  automatically.  You
              need  to  provide  an  AWS-KMS  key  only  if  you want to use a
              non-default AWS-KMS key, or if you are using an  Encryption:Mode
              of aes-cbc-pkcs7 , aes-ctr , or aes-gcm .

                S3 bucket.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 save the transcoded files. Specify this value when all of the
                 following are true:

                 o You want to save transcoded files, thumbnails (if any), and

                 If you want to save transcoded files  and  playlists  in  one
                 bucket  and thumbnails in another bucket, specify which users
                 can access the transcoded files or the permissions the  users
                 have,  or  change  the  Amazon S3 storage class, omit Output-
                 Bucket and specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailCon-
                 fig instead.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The  Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy ,
                 that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the video files

                 want them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum  of
                 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.

                 If  you  include Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants only
                 the permissions that you specify. It does not grant full per-
                 missions  to the owner of the role specified by Role . If you
                 want that user to have  full  control,  you  must  explicitly
                 grant full control to the user.

                 If you omit Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants full con-
                 trol over the transcoded files and playlists to the owner  of
                 the  role specified by Role , and grants no other permissions
                 to any other user or group.

                    S3 bucket.

                  o READ_ACP : The grantee can read the object ACL for  thumb-
                    nails  that  Elastic  Transcoder  adds  to  the  Amazon S3
                    bucket.

                  o WRITE_ACP : The grantee can write the ACL for  the  thumb-
                    nails  that  Elastic  Transcoder  adds  to  the  Amazon S3
                    bucket.

                  o FULL_CONTROL  :  The  grantee  has  READ,  READ_ACP,   and
                    WRITE_ACP  permissions  for  the  thumbnails  that Elastic
                    Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.

              o StorageClass :  The  Amazon  S3  storage  class,  Standard  or
                ReducedRedundancy , that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign
                to the thumbnails that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder  to
                 save the transcoded files. Specify this value when all of the
                 following are true:

                 o You want to save transcoded files, thumbnails (if any), and
                   playlists (if any) together in one bucket.

                 o You  do  not  want  to specify the users or groups who have
                   access to the transcoded files, thumbnails, and  playlists.

                 o You  do  not  want  to specify the permissions that Elastic
                   Transcoder grants to the files.

                 o You want to associate the transcoded files  and  thumbnails
                   with the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.

                 If  you  want  to  save transcoded files and playlists in one
                 bucket and thumbnails in another bucket, specify which  users
                 can  access the transcoded files or the permissions the users
                 have, or change the Amazon S3  storage  class,  omit  Output-
                 Bucket and specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailCon-
                 fig instead.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy  ,
                 that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the video files
                 and playlists that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket.

              Permissions -> (list)
                 Optional. The Permissions object specifies which users and/or
                 predefined  Amazon  S3  groups  you  want  to  have access to
                 transcoded files and playlists, and the type  of  access  you
                 want  them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum of
                 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.

                 If you include Permissions , Elastic Transcoder  grants  only
                 the permissions that you specify. It does not grant full per-
                 missions to the owner of the role specified by Role . If  you
                 want  that  user  to  have  full control, you must explicitly
                 grant full control to the user.

                 If you omit Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants full con-
                 trol  over the transcoded files and playlists to the owner of
                 the role specified by Role , and grants no other  permissions
                 to any other user or group.

                     GranteeType -> (string)
                        The type of value that appears in the Grantee object:

                        o Canonical  : Either the canonical user ID for an AWS
                          account or an origin access identity for  an  Amazon

                        WARNING:
                            A  canonical  user  ID  is  not the same as an AWS

                        o FULL_CONTROL  :  The grantee has READ, READ_ACP, and
                          WRITE_ACP permissions for the thumbnails that  Elas-
