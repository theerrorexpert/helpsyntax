LIST-PRESETS()                                                  LIST-PRESETS()



NAME
       list-presets -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListPresets  operation gets a list of the default presets included
       with Elastic Transcoder and the presets that you've  added  in  an  AWS
       region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-presets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Presets

SYNOPSIS
            list-presets
          [--ascending <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ascending (string)
          To list presets in chronological order by the  date  and  time  that
          they  were  created, enter true . To list presets in reverse chrono-
          logical order, enter false .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Presets -> (list)
          An array of Preset objects.

          (structure)
              Presets are templates that contain  most  of  the  settings  for
              transcoding  media  files  from  one  format to another. Elastic
              Transcoder includes some default presets for common formats, for
              example,  several  iPod and iPhone versions. You can also create
              your own presets for formats  that  aren't  included  among  the
              default  presets.  You specify which preset you want to use when
              you create a job.

              Id -> (string)
                 Identifier for the new preset. You use this value to get set-
                 tings for the preset or to delete it.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the preset.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the preset.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the preset.

              Container -> (string)
                 The  container type for the output file. Valid values include
                 flac , flv , fmp4 , gif , mp3 , mp4 , mpg , mxf , oga , ogg ,
                 ts , and webm .

              Audio -> (structure)
                 A  section  of  the  response  body that provides information
                 about the audio preset values.

                 Codec -> (string)
                     The audio codec for the output file. Valid values include
                     aac , flac , mp2 , mp3 , pcm , and vorbis .

                 SampleRate -> (string)
                     The  sample  rate of the audio stream in the output file,
                     in Hertz. Valid values include:
                        auto , 22050 , 32000 , 44100 , 48000 , 96000

                     If you specify auto ,  Elastic  Transcoder  automatically
                     detects the sample rate.

                 BitRate -> (string)
                     The  bit  rate of the audio stream in the output file, in
                     kilobits/second. Enter an integer  between  64  and  320,
                     inclusive.

                 Channels -> (string)
                     The number of audio channels in the output file. The fol-
                     lowing values are valid:
                        auto , 0 , 1 , 2

                     One channel carries the information played  by  a  single
                     speaker.  For  example,  a stereo track with two channels
                     sends one channel to the  left  speaker,  and  the  other
                     channel  to  the  right  speaker. The output channels are
                     organized into tracks. If you want Elastic Transcoder  to
                     automatically  detect the number of audio channels in the
                     input file and use that value for the output file, select
                     auto .

                     The  output of a specific channel value and inputs are as
                     follows:

                     o auto  channel specified, with any input:  Pass  through
                       up to eight input channels.

                     o 0   channels  specified,  with any input: Audio omitted
                       from the output.

                     o 1  channel specified, with at least one input  channel:
                       Mono sound.

                     o 2   channels  specified,  with any input: Two identical
                       mono channels or stereo.  For  more  information  about
                       tracks, see Audio:AudioPackingMode.

                     For  more  information about how Elastic Transcoder orga-
                     nizes channels and tracks, see Audio:AudioPackingMode .

                 AudioPackingMode -> (string)
                     The method of organizing audio channels and  tracks.  Use
                     Audio:Channels  to specify the number of channels in your
                     output, and Audio:AudioPackingMode to specify the  number
                     of  tracks  and their relation to the channels. If you do
                     not   specify   an   Audio:AudioPackingMode   ,   Elastic
                     Transcoder uses SingleTrack .

                     The following values are valid:
                        SingleTrack  , OneChannelPerTrack , and OneChannelPer-
                        TrackWithMosTo8Tracks

                     When you specify SingleTrack , Elastic Transcoder creates
                     a  single track for your output. The track can have up to
                     eight channels. Use SingleTrack for all non-mxf  contain-
                     ers.

                     The  outputs  of SingleTrack for a specific channel value
                     and inputs are as follows:

                     o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the out-
                       put

                     o 1,  2,  or  auto   channels  with no audio input: Audio
                       omitted from the output

                     o 1  channel with any input with audio:  One  track  with
                       one channel, downmixed if necessary

                     o 2   channels with one track with one channel: One track
                       with two identical channels

                     o 2 or auto  channels with two tracks  with  one  channel
                       each: One track with two channels

                     o 2  or  auto  channels with one track with two channels:
                       One track with two channels

                     o 2  channels with one track with multiple channels:  One
                       track with two channels

                     o auto   channels  with  one  track with one channel: One
                       track with one channel

                     o auto  channels with one track with  multiple  channels:
                       One track with multiple channels

                     When  you specify OneChannelPerTrack , Elastic Transcoder
                     creates a new track for every  channel  in  your  output.
                     Your output can have up to eight single-channel tracks.

                     The  outputs of OneChannelPerTrack for a specific channel
                     value and inputs are as follows:

                     o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the out-
                       put

                     o 1,  2,  or  auto   channels  with no audio input: Audio
                       omitted from the output

                     o 1  channel with any input with audio:  One  track  with
                       one channel, downmixed if necessary

                     o 2  channels with one track with one channel: Two tracks
                       with one identical channel each

                     o 2 or auto  channels with two tracks  with  one  channel
                       each: Two tracks with one channel each

                     o 2  or  auto  channels with one track with two channels:
                       Two tracks with one channel each

                     o 2  channels with one track with multiple channels:  Two
                       tracks with one channel each

                     o auto   channels  with  one  track with one channel: One
                       track with one channel

                     o auto  channels with one track with  multiple  channels:
                       Up to eight tracks with one channel each

                     When  you  specify  OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks  ,
                     Elastic Transcoder creates  eight  single-channel  tracks
                     for  your  output.  All  tracks that do not contain audio
                     data from an input channel are MOS,  or  Mit  Out  Sound,
                     tracks.

                     The  outputs  of OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks for a
                     specific channel value and inputs are as follows:

                     o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the out-
                       put

                     o 1,  2,  or  auto   channels  with no audio input: Audio
                       omitted from the output

                     o 1  channel with any input with audio:  One  track  with
                       one  channel,  downmixed  if  necessary,  plus  six MOS
                       tracks

                     o 2  channels with one track with one channel: Two tracks
                       with one identical channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                     o 2  or  auto   channels with two tracks with one channel
                       each: Two tracks with one channel each,  plus  six  MOS
                       tracks

                     o 2  or  auto  channels with one track with two channels:
                       Two tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                     o 2  channels with one track with multiple channels:  Two
                       tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                     o auto   channels  with  one  track with one channel: One
                       track with one channel, plus seven MOS tracks

                     o auto  channels with one track with  multiple  channels:
                       Up  to  eight  tracks  with  one channel each, plus MOS
                       tracks until there are eight tracks in all

                 CodecOptions -> (structure)
                     If you specified AAC for Audio:Codec , this  is  the  AAC
                     compression profile to use. Valid values include:
                        auto , AAC-LC , HE-AAC , HE-AACv2

                     If  you  specify auto , Elastic Transcoder chooses a pro-
                     file based on the bit rate of the output file.

                     Profile -> (string)
                        You can only choose an audio profile when you  specify
                        AAC for the value of Audio:Codec.

                        Specify  the  AAC profile for the output file. Elastic
                        Transcoder supports the following profiles:

                        o auto : If you  specify  auto  ,  Elastic  Transcoder
                          selects  the  profile based on the bit rate selected
                          for the output file.

                        o AAC-LC : The most common AAC profile.  Use  for  bit
                          rates larger than 64 kbps.

                        o HE-AAC  :  Not  supported  on some older players and
                          devices. Use for bit rates between 40 and 80 kbps.

                        o HE-AACv2  :  Not  supported  on  some  players   and
                          devices. Use for bit rates less than 48 kbps.

                        All  outputs  in  a Smooth playlist must have the same
                        value for Profile .

                        NOTE:
                            If you created any  presets  before  AAC  profiles
                            were   added,   Elastic  Transcoder  automatically
                            updated your presets to use AAC-LC. You can change
                            the value as required.

                     BitDepth -> (string)
                        You  can only choose an audio bit depth when you spec-
                        ify flac or pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                        The bit depth of a sample is how many bits of informa-
                        tion are included in the audio samples. The higher the
                        bit depth, the better the audio, but  the  larger  the
                        file.

                        Valid values are 16 and 24 .

                        The most common bit depth is 24 .

                     BitOrder -> (string)
                        You  can only choose an audio bit order when you spec-
                        ify pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                        The order the bits of a PCM sample are stored in.

                        The supported value is LittleEndian .

                     Signed -> (string)
                        You can only choose whether an audio sample is  signed
                        when you specify pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                        Whether  audio  samples  are represented with negative
                        and positive numbers (signed) or only positive numbers
                        (unsigned).

                        The supported value is Signed .

              Video -> (structure)
                 A  section  of  the  response  body that provides information
                 about the video preset values.

                 Codec -> (string)
                     The video codec for the output file. Valid values include
                     gif  , H.264 , mpeg2 , vp8 , and vp9 . You can only spec-
                     ify vp8 and vp9 when the container type  is  webm  ,  gif
                     when  the container type is gif , and mpeg2 when the con-
                     tainer type is mpg .

                 CodecOptions -> (map)
                        Profile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)

                     The H.264 profile that you want to  use  for  the  output
                     file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:

                     o baseline : The profile most commonly used for videocon-
                       ferencing and for mobile applications.

                     o main : The profile used for standard-definition digital
                       TV broadcasts.

                     o high : The profile used for high-definition digital  TV
                       broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.
                        Level (H.264 Only)

                     The H.264 level that you want to use for the output file.
                     Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:
                        1 , 1b , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 2 , 2.1 , 2.2 , 3 ,  3.1  ,
                        3.2 , 4 , 4.1

                        MaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)

                     Applicable  only  when the value of Video:Codec is H.264.
                     The maximum number of previously decoded frames to use as
                     a  reference for decoding future frames. Valid values are
                     integers 0 through 16, but we recommend that you not  use
                     a value greater than the following:
                        Min(Floor(Maximum   decoded  picture  buffer  in  mac-
                        roblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels  *  Height  in  pix-
                        els)), 16)

                     where  Width  in  pixels  and  Height in pixels represent
                     either MaxWidth and  MaxHeight,  or  Resolution.  Maximum
                     decoded  picture  buffer  in  macroblocks  depends on the
                     value of the Level object. See the list  below.  (A  mac-
                     roblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)

                     o 1 - 396

                     o 1b - 396

                     o 1.1 - 900

                     o 1.2 - 2376

                     o 1.3 - 2376

                     o 2 - 2376

                     o 2.1 - 4752

                     o 2.2 - 8100

                     o 3 - 8100

                     o 3.1 - 18000

                     o 3.2 - 20480

                     o 4 - 32768

                     o 4.1 - 32768
                        MaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)

                     The  maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer;
                     the size of the buffer is specified by BufferSize . Spec-
                     ify  a  value  between  16 and 62,500. You can reduce the
                     bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the max-
                     imum  bit  rate, but this also reduces the quality of the
                     video.
                        BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)

                     The maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output
                     video.  This  window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard
                     segment duration when you're using FMP4  or  MPEG-TS  for
                     the  container type of the output video. Specify an inte-
                     ger greater than 0. If you specify  MaxBitRate  and  omit
                     BufferSize  ,  Elastic  Transcoder  sets BufferSize to 10
                     times the value of MaxBitRate .
                        InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)

                     The interlace mode for the output video.

                     Interlaced video is used to double  the  perceived  frame
                     rate  for a video by interlacing two fields (one field on
                     every other line, the other field on the other lines)  so
                     that the human eye registers multiple pictures per frame.
                     Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required for  transmit-
                     ting a video, but can result in blurred images and flick-
                     ering.

                     Valid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top  to
                     bottom),  TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom
                     field first), and Auto .

                     If InterlaceMode is  not  specified,  Elastic  Transcoder
                     uses  Progressive  for  the output. If Auto is specified,
                     Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output.
                        ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)

                     The color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies  to
                     the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by
                     the computer to store information  about  how  to  render
                     color.  Bt.601  is  the  standard for standard definition
                     video, while Bt.709 is the standard for  high  definition
                     video.

                     Valid values include None , Bt709toBt601 , Bt601toBt709 ,
                     and Auto .

                     If you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode  and  your
                     output  is  interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97 ,
                     24 , 25 , 29.97 , 50 , or 60 ,  your  SegmentDuration  is
                     null,  and  you  are  using one of the resolution changes
                     from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the  fol-
                     lowing color space conversions:

                     o Standard   to   HD,  720x480  to  1920x1080  -  Elastic
                       Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709

                     o Standard  to  HD,  720x576  to  1920x1080   -   Elastic
                       Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709

                     o HD   to   Standard,  1920x1080  to  720x480  -  Elastic
                       Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601

                     o HD  to  Standard,  1920x1080  to  720x576   -   Elastic
                       Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601

                     NOTE:
                        Elastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the Col-
                        orspaceConversionMode  Auto mode in  the  future.  All
                        outputs in a playlist must use the same ColorSpaceCon-
                        versionMode .

                     If you do not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode ,  Elas-
                     tic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file.
                     If  you  are  unsure  what  ColorSpaceConversionMode  was
                     applied  to  your output file, you can check the Applied-
                     ColorSpaceConversion  parameter  included  in  your   job
                     response. If your job does not have an AppliedColorSpace-
                     Conversion in its response,  no  ColorSpaceConversionMode
                     was applied.
                        ChromaSubsampling

                     The  sampling  pattern for the chroma (color) channels of
                     the  output  video.  Valid  values  include  yuv420p  and
                     yuv422p .
                        yuv420p  samples the chroma information of every other
                        horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p sam-
                        ples  the  color  information of every horizontal line
                        and every other vertical line.

                        LoopCount (Gif Only)

                     The number of times you want  the  output  gif  to  loop.
                     Valid  values include Infinite and integers between 0 and
                     100 , inclusive.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 KeyframesMaxDist -> (string)
                     Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is  one  of
                     H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .

                     The  maximum  number  of  frames  between key frames. Key
                     frames are fully encoded frames; the frames  between  key
                     frames  are encoded based, in part, on the content of the
                     key frames. The  value  is  an  integer  formatted  as  a
                     string;  valid values are between 1 (every frame is a key
                     frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value  results  in
                     higher  compression  but  may  also  discernibly decrease
                     video quality.

                     For Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must  have  a  constant
                     ratio  to  the  KeyframesMaxDist  .  This  allows  Smooth
                     playlists to  switch  between  different  quality  levels
                     while the file is being played.

                     For  example,  an  input  file can have a FrameRate of 30
                     with a KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs
                     to  have a ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameR-
                     ate of 30, 25, and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist  of  90,  75,
                     and 30, respectively.

                     Alternately, this can be achieved by setting FrameRate to
                     auto and having the  same  values  for  MaxFrameRate  and
                     KeyframesMaxDist .

                 FixedGOP -> (string)
                     Applicable  only  when the value of Video:Codec is one of
                     H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .

                     Whether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP . Valid  values
                     are true and false :

                     o true  : Elastic Transcoder uses the value of Keyframes-
                       MaxDist for the distance between key frames (the number
                       of frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).

                     o false : The distance between key frames can vary.

                     WARNING:
                        FixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.

                 BitRate -> (string)
                     The  bit  rate of the video stream in the output file, in
                     kilobits/second. Valid values depend  on  the  values  of
                     Level  and  Profile  .  If  you  specify  auto  , Elastic
                     Transcoder uses  the  detected  bit  rate  of  the  input
                     source.  If you specify a value other than auto , we rec-
                     ommend that you specify a value less than or equal to the
                     maximum  H.264-compliant  value listed for your level and
                     profile:

                 FrameRate -> (string)
                     The frames per second for the video stream in the  output
                     file. Valid values include:
                        auto , 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

                     If  you  specify  auto  ,  Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the
                     detected frame rate of the input source. If you specify a
                     frame  rate,  we recommend that you perform the following
                     calculation:
                        Frame rate = maximum  recommended  decoding  speed  in
                        luma  samples/second  /  (width  in pixels * height in
                        pixels)

                     where:

                     o width in pixels and height in pixels represent the Res-
                       olution of the output video.

                     o maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/sec-
                       ond is less than or equal to the maximum  value  listed
                       in  the  following  table,  based on the value that you
                       specified for Level.

                     The maximum  recommended  decoding  speed  in  Luma  sam-
                     ples/second  for each level is described in the following

                 MaxFrameRate -> (string)
                     If you specify auto for FrameRate  ,  Elastic  Transcoder
                     uses the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate
                     of the output video. Specify the maximum frame rate  that
                     you want Elastic Transcoder to use when the frame rate of
                     the input video is greater than the desired maximum frame
                     rate of the output video. Valid values include: 10 , 15 ,
                     23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60 .

                 Resolution -> (string)

                     WARNING:

                        put  videos,  we  recommend  that  you  use the values
                        MaxWidth , MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy  ,
                        and   DisplayAspectRatio  instead  of  Resolution  and

                        exclusive. Do not use them together.

                     The  width and height of the video in the output file, in
                     pixels. Valid values are auto and width x height :

                     o auto : Elastic  Transcoder  attempts  to  preserve  the
                       width and height of the input file, subject to the fol-
                       lowing rules.

                       width x height `` : The width and height of the  output
                       video in pixels.

                     Note the following about specifying the width and height:

                     o The width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096,
                       inclusive.

                     o The height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072,
                       inclusive.

                     o If you specify a resolution that is less than the reso-
                       lution  of  the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales
                       the output file to the lower resolution.

                     o If you specify a resolution that is  greater  than  the
                       resolution   of  the  input  file,  Elastic  Transcoder
                       rescales the output to the higher resolution.

                     o We recommend that you specify a  resolution  for  which
                       the  product  of width and height is less than or equal
                       to the applicable value in the following list  (List  -

                        put videos, we  recommend  that  you  use  the  values
                        MaxWidth  , MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy ,
                        and  DisplayAspectRatio  instead  of  Resolution   and

                        exclusive. Do not use them together.

                     The display aspect ratio of the video in the output file.
                     Valid values include:
                        auto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                     If  you  specify  auto , Elastic Transcoder tries to pre-
                     serve the aspect ratio of the input file.

                     If you specify an aspect ratio for the output  file  that
                     differs  from  aspect  ratio  of  the input file, Elastic
                     Transcoder adds pillarboxing (black bars on the sides) or
                     letterboxing  (black bars on the top and bottom) to main-
                     tain the aspect ratio of the active region of the  video.

                 MaxWidth -> (string)
                     The  maximum  width of the output video in pixels. If you
                     specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD)  as
                     the  default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter
                     an even integer between 128 and 4096.

                 MaxHeight -> (string)
                     The maximum height of the output video in pixels. If  you
                     specify  auto , Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as
                     the default value. If you specify a numeric value,  enter
                     an even integer between 96 and 3072.

                 DisplayAspectRatio -> (string)
                     The value that Elastic Transcoder adds to the metadata in
                     the output file.

                 SizingPolicy -> (string)
                     Specify one of the following values to control scaling of
                     the output video:

                     o Fit  : Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so it
                       matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth
                       or MaxHeight without exceeding the other value.

                     o Fill : Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so it
                       matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth
                       or  MaxHeight  and  matches or exceeds the other value.
                       Elastic Transcoder centers the output  video  and  then
                       crops  it  in  the  dimension (if any) that exceeds the
                       maximum value.

                     o Stretch : Elastic Transcoder stretches the output video
                       to match the values that you specified for MaxWidth and
                       MaxHeight . If the relative proportions  of  the  input
                       video  and  the  output video are different, the output
                       video will be distorted.

                     o Keep : Elastic Transcoder does  not  scale  the  output
                       video.  If  either dimension of the input video exceeds
                       the values that you specified  for  MaxWidth  and  Max-
                       Height , Elastic Transcoder crops the output video.

                     o ShrinkToFit  :  Elastic  Transcoder  scales  the output
                       video down so that its dimensions match the values that
                       you  specified  for  at  least one of MaxWidth and Max-
                       Height without exceeding either value. If  you  specify
                       this  option,  Elastic  Transcoder  does  not scale the
                       video up.

                     o ShrinkToFill : Elastic  Transcoder  scales  the  output
                       video down so that its dimensions match the values that
                       you specified for at least one  of  MaxWidth  and  Max-
                       Height  without  dropping  below  either  value. If you
                       specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not  scale
                       the video up.

                 PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                     When  you  set  PaddingPolicy to Pad , Elastic Transcoder
                     may add black bars to the top and bottom and/or left  and
                     right sides of the output video to make the total size of
                     the output video match the values that you specified  for
                     MaxWidth and MaxHeight .

                 Watermarks -> (list)
                     Settings  for the size, location, and opacity of graphics
                     that you want Elastic Transcoder to overlay  over  videos
                     that  are  transcoded  using this preset. You can specify
                     settings for up to four watermarks. Watermarks appear  in
                     the  specified  size and location, and with the specified
                     opacity for the duration of the transcoded video.

                     Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want  to
                     display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png
                     format, which supports transparency.

                     When you create a job that uses this preset, you  specify
                     the   .png   or  .jpg  graphics  that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder to include in the transcoded videos.  You  can
                     specify fewer graphics in the job than you specify water-
                     mark settings in the preset, which allows you to use  the
                     same preset for up to four watermarks that have different
                     dimensions.

                     (structure)
                        Settings for the size, location, and opacity of graph-

                        videos that are transcoded using this preset. You  can
                        specify settings for up to four watermarks. Watermarks
                        appear in the specified size and  location,  and  with
                        the   specified   opacity  for  the  duration  of  the
                        transcoded video.

                        Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you  want
                        to  display  a  watermark that is not rectangular, use
                        the .png format, which supports transparency.

                        When you create a job that uses this preset, you spec-
                        ify  the  .png  or .jpg graphics that you want Elastic
                        Transcoder to include in the  transcoded  videos.  You
                        can specify fewer graphics in the job than you specify
                        watermark settings in the preset, which allows you  to
                        use  the  same  preset  for up to four watermarks that
                        have different dimensions.

                        Id -> (string)
                            A unique  identifier  for  the  settings  for  one
                            watermark. The value of Id can be up to 40 charac-
                            ters long.

                        MaxWidth -> (string)
                            The maximum width of the watermark in one  of  the
                            following formats:

                            o number  of  pixels (px): The minimum value is 16
                              pixels, and the maximum value is  the  value  of
                              MaxWidth .

                            o integer  percentage (%): The range of valid val-
                              ues is 0 to 100. Use  the  value  of  Target  to
                              specify  whether  you want Elastic Transcoder to
                              include the black bars that are added by Elastic
                              Transcoder,  if  any, in the calculation. If you
                              specify the value in pixels,  it  must  be  less
                              than or equal to the value of MaxWidth .

                        MaxHeight -> (string)
                            The  maximum height of the watermark in one of the
                            following formats:

                            o number of pixels (px): The minimum value  is  16
                              pixels,  and  the  maximum value is the value of
                              MaxHeight .

                            o integer percentage (%): The range of valid  val-
                              ues  is  0  to  100.  Use the value of Target to
                              specify whether you want Elastic  Transcoder  to
                              include the black bars that are added by Elastic
                              Transcoder, if any, in the calculation.

                            If you specify the value in  pixels,  it  must  be
                            less than or equal to the value of MaxHeight .

                        SizingPolicy -> (string)
                            A value that controls scaling of the watermark:

                            o Fit : Elastic Transcoder scales the watermark so
                              it matches  the  value  that  you  specified  in
                              either  MaxWidth  or MaxHeight without exceeding
                              the other value.

                            o Stretch  :  Elastic  Transcoder  stretches   the
                              watermark to match the values that you specified
                              for MaxWidth and MaxHeight  .  If  the  relative
                              proportions  of  the watermark and the values of
                              MaxWidth and MaxHeight are different, the water-
                              mark will be distorted.

                            o ShrinkToFit  :  Elastic  Transcoder  scales  the
                              watermark down so that its dimensions match  the
                              values  that  you  specified for at least one of
                              MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceeding  either
                              value.  If  you  specify  this  option,  Elastic
                              Transcoder does not scale the watermark up.

                        HorizontalAlign -> (string)
                            The horizontal position of  the  watermark  unless
                            you  specify a non-zero value for HorizontalOffset
                            :

                            o Left : The left edge of the watermark is aligned
                              with the left border of the video.

                            o Right  :  The  right  edge  of  the watermark is
                              aligned with the right border of the video.

                            o Center : The watermark is centered  between  the
                              left and right borders.

                        HorizontalOffset -> (string)
                            The  amount by which you want the horizontal posi-
                            tion of the watermark to be offset from the  posi-
                            tion specified by HorizontalAlign:

                            o number  of  pixels  (px): The minimum value is 0
                              pixels, and the maximum value is  the  value  of
                              MaxWidth.

                            o integer  percentage (%): The range of valid val-
                              ues is 0 to 100.

                            For example, if you specify  Left  for  Horizonta-
                            lAlign  and  5px  for  HorizontalOffset , the left
                            side of the watermark appears 5  pixels  from  the
                            left border of the output video.
                               HorizontalOffset  is  only valid when the value
                               of HorizontalAlign is Left or Right  .  If  you
                               specify  an offset that causes the watermark to
                               extend beyond the  left  or  right  border  and
                               Elastic  Transcoder  has  not added black bars,
                               the watermark is cropped. If Elastic Transcoder
                               has  added  black  bars,  the watermark extends
                               into the black bars. If the  watermark  extends
                               beyond the black bars, it is cropped.

                            Use  the  value  of  Target to specify whether you
                            want to include the black bars that are  added  by
                            Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the offset calcula-
                            tion.

                        VerticalAlign -> (string)
                            The vertical position of the watermark unless  you
                            specify a non-zero value for VerticalOffset :

                            o Top  :  The top edge of the watermark is aligned
                              with the top border of the video.

                            o Bottom : The bottom edge  of  the  watermark  is
                              aligned with the bottom border of the video.

                            o Center  :  The watermark is centered between the
                              top and bottom borders.

                        VerticalOffset -> (string)
                               VerticalOffset

                            The amount by which you want the vertical position
                            of  the  watermark  to be offset from the position
                            specified by VerticalAlign:

                            o number of pixels (px): The minimum  value  is  0
                              pixels,  and  the  maximum value is the value of
                              MaxHeight .

                            o integer percentage (%): The range of valid  val-
                              ues is 0 to 100.

                            For  example, if you specify Top for VerticalAlign
                            and 5px for VerticalOffset , the top of the water-
                            mark  appears  5 pixels from the top border of the
                            output video.
                               VerticalOffset is only valid when the value  of
                               VerticalAlign is Top or Bottom.

                            If you specify an offset that causes the watermark
                            to extend beyond the  top  or  bottom  border  and
                            Elastic  Transcoder  has not added black bars, the
                            watermark is cropped. If  Elastic  Transcoder  has
                            added  black  bars, the watermark extends into the
                            black bars. If the watermark  extends  beyond  the
                            black bars, it is cropped.

                            Use  the  value  of  Target to specify whether you
                            want Elastic Transcoder to include the black  bars
                            that  are  added by Elastic Transcoder, if any, in
                            the offset calculation.

                        Opacity -> (string)
                            A percentage that indicates how much  you  want  a
                            watermark  to  obscure  the  video in the location
                            where it appears. Valid values are 0  (the  water-
                            mark  is  invisible)  to  100  (the watermark com-
                            pletely obscures the video in the specified  loca-
                            tion). The datatype of Opacity is float.

                            Elastic   Transcoder   supports  transparent  .png
                            graphics. If  you  use  a  transparent  .png,  the
                            transparent portion of the video appears as if you
                            had specified a value of 0 for Opacity . The  .jpg
                            file format doesn't support transparency.

                        Target -> (string)
                            A  value  that  determines  how Elastic Transcoder
                            interprets values that you specified for  Horizon-
                            talOffset  ,  VerticalOffset , MaxWidth , and Max-
                            Height :

                            o Content :  HorizontalOffset  and  VerticalOffset
                              values  are  calculated  based on the borders of
                              the video excluding black bars added by  Elastic
                              Transcoder,  if  any.  In addition, MaxWidth and
                              MaxHeight , if specified as  a  percentage,  are
                              calculated  based  on  the  borders of the video
                              excluding   black   bars   added   by    Elastic
                              Transcoder, if any.

                            o Frame : HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset val-
                              ues are calculated based on the borders  of  the
                              video  including  black  bars  added  by Elastic
                              Transcoder, if any. In  addition,  MaxWidth  and
                              MaxHeight  ,  if  specified as a percentage, are
                              calculated based on the  borders  of  the  video
                              including    black   bars   added   by   Elastic
                              Transcoder, if any.

              Thumbnails -> (structure)
                 A section of the  response  body  that  provides  information
                 about the thumbnail preset values, if any.

                 Format -> (string)
                     The  format  of  thumbnails, if any. Valid values are jpg
                     and png .

                     You specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder to create
                     thumbnails when you create a job.

                 Interval -> (string)
                     The  approximate  number  of  seconds between thumbnails.
                     Specify an integer value.

                 Resolution -> (string)

                     The aspect ratio of thumbnails. Valid values include:
                        auto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                     If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder  tries  to  pre-
                     serve the aspect ratio of the video in the output file.

                 MaxWidth -> (string)
                     The maximum width of thumbnails in pixels. If you specify
                     auto, Elastic Transcoder  uses  1920  (Full  HD)  as  the
                     default  value.  If you specify a numeric value, enter an
                     even integer between 32 and 4096.

                 MaxHeight -> (string)
                     The maximum height of thumbnails in pixels. If you  spec-
                     ify  auto,  Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the
                     default value. If you specify a numeric value,  enter  an
                     even integer between 32 and 3072.

                 SizingPolicy -> (string)
                     Specify one of the following values to control scaling of
                     thumbnails:

                     o Fit : Elastic  Transcoder  scales  thumbnails  so  they
                       match   the  value  that  you  specified  in  thumbnail
                       MaxWidth or MaxHeight settings  without  exceeding  the
                       other value.

                     o Fill  :  Elastic  Transcoder  scales thumbnails so they
                       match  the  value  that  you  specified  in   thumbnail
                       MaxWidth  or  MaxHeight settings and matches or exceeds
                       the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers  the  image
                       in  thumbnails and then crops in the dimension (if any)
                       that exceeds the maximum value.

                     o Stretch : Elastic Transcoder  stretches  thumbnails  to
                       match  the  values  that  you  specified  for thumbnail
                       MaxWidth and MaxHeight settings. If the  relative  pro-
                       portions  of the input video and thumbnails are differ-
                       ent, the thumbnails will be distorted.

                     o Keep : Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails. If
                       either  dimension of the input video exceeds the values
                       that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight
                       settings, Elastic Transcoder crops the thumbnails.

                     o ShrinkToFit : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down
                       so that their dimensions  match  the  values  that  you
                       specified  for  at  least one of thumbnail MaxWidth and
                       MaxHeight without exceeding either value. If you  spec-
                       ify  this  option,  Elastic  Transcoder  does not scale
                       thumbnails up.

                     o ShrinkToFill :  Elastic  Transcoder  scales  thumbnails
                       down so that their dimensions match the values that you
                       specified for at least one of  MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight
                       without  dropping  below  either  value. If you specify
                       this option, Elastic Transcoder does not  scale  thumb-
