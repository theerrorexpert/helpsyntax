NAME
       update-pipeline -

DESCRIPTION
       Use the UpdatePipeline operation to update settings for a pipeline.

       WARNING:
          When  you change pipeline settings, your changes take effect immedi-
          ately. Jobs  that  you  have  already  submitted  and  that  Elastic
          Transcoder  has  not  started to process are affected in addition to
          jobs that you submit after you change settings.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-pipeline
          --id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--input-bucket <value>]
          [--role <value>]
          [--aws-kms-key-arn <value>]
          [--notifications <value>]
          [--content-config <value>]
          [--thumbnail-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the pipeline that you want to update.

       --name (string)
          The name of the pipeline. We  recommend  that  the  name  be  unique
          within the AWS account, but uniqueness is not enforced.

          Constraints: Maximum 40 characters

       --input-bucket (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  bucket  in which you saved the media files that you
          want to transcode and the graphics that you want to  use  as  water-
          marks.

       --role (string)
          The  IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the role that you want Elas-
          tic Transcoder to use to transcode jobs for this pipeline.

       --aws-kms-key-arn (string)
          The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that you  want  to  use
          with this pipeline.

          If  you  use  either  s3 or s3-aws-kms as your Encryption:Mode , you
          don't need to provide a key with your job  because  a  default  key,
          known  as an AWS-KMS key, is created for you automatically. You need
          to provide an AWS-KMS key only if you  want  to  use  a  non-default
          AWS-KMS key, or if you are using an Encryption:Mode of aes-cbc-pkcs7
          , aes-ctr , or aes-gcm .

              canonical  user  IDs,  see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in
              the Amazon Simple Storage  Service  Developer  Guide.  For  more
              information  about  using CloudFront origin access identities to
              require that users use CloudFront  URLs  instead  of  Amazon  S3
              URLs,  see Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to
              Your Amazon S3 Content.

            WARNING:
                A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS account  number.

                       account  or  an  origin  access  identity for an Amazon
                       CloudFront distribution.

                     WARNING:
                        A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS  account
                        number.

                     o Email : The registered email address of an AWS account.

                     transcoded  files  and playlists. To identify the user or
                     group, you can specify the canonical user ID for  an  AWS
                     account,  an origin access identity for a CloudFront dis-
                     tribution,  the  registered  email  address  of  an   AWS

                     The permission that you want to give to the AWS user that
                     is listed in Grantee. Valid values include:

                     o READ : The grantee can read the thumbnails and metadata
                       for thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Ama-
                       zon S3 bucket.

                     o READ_ACP : The grantee can  read  the  object  ACL  for

          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Pipeline -> (structure)
          The pipeline updated by this UpdatePipelineResponse call.

          Id -> (string)
              The  identifier for the pipeline. You use this value to identify
              the pipeline in which you want to perform a  variety  of  opera-
              tions, such as creating a job or a preset.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the pipeline.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of the pipeline. We recommend that the name be unique
              within the AWS account, but uniqueness is not enforced.

              Constraints: Maximum 40 characters

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the pipeline:

              o Active : The pipeline is processing jobs.

              o Paused : The pipeline is not currently processing jobs.

          InputBucket -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket from which Elastic  Transcoder  gets  media
              files  for  transcoding and the graphics files, if any, that you
              want to use for watermarks.

          OutputBucket -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket in which you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to
              save  transcoded  files,  thumbnails,  and playlists. Either you
              specify this value, or you specify both ContentConfig and Thumb-
              nailConfig .

          Role -> (string)
              The  IAM  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for the role that Elastic
              Transcoder uses to transcode jobs for this pipeline.

          AwsKmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that  you  want  to
              use with this pipeline.

              If you use either s3 or s3-aws-kms as your Encryption:Mode , you
              don't need to provide a key with your job because a default key,
              known  as  an AWS-KMS key, is created for you automatically. You
              need to provide an AWS-KMS  key  only  if  you  want  to  use  a
              non-default  AWS-KMS key, or if you are using an Encryption:Mode
              of aes-cbc-pkcs7 , aes-ctr , or aes-gcm .

              o StorageClass  :  The  Amazon  S3  storage  class,  Standard or
                ReducedRedundancy, that you want Elastic Transcoder to  assign
                to the video files and playlists that it stores in your Amazon
                S3 bucket.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder  to
                 save the transcoded files. Specify this value when all of the
                 following are true:

                 o You want to save transcoded files, thumbnails (if any), and
                   playlists (if any) together in one bucket.

                 o You  do  not  want  to specify the users or groups who have
                   access to the transcoded files, thumbnails, and  playlists.

                 o You  do  not  want  to specify the permissions that Elastic

                 o You want to associate the transcoded files  and  thumbnails
                   with the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.

                 If  you  want  to  save transcoded files and playlists in one
                 bucket and thumbnails in another bucket, specify which  users
                 can  access the transcoded files or the permissions the users
                 have, or change the Amazon S3  storage  class,  omit  Output-
                 Bucket and specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailCon-
                 fig instead.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy  ,
                 that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the video files

                 transcoded files and playlists, and the type  of  access  you
                 want  them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum of
                 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.

                 If you include Permissions , Elastic Transcoder  grants  only
                 the permissions that you specify. It does not grant full per-
                 missions to the owner of the role specified by Role . If  you
                 want  that  user  to  have  full control, you must explicitly
                 grant full control to the user.

                 If you omit Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants full con-
                 trol  over the transcoded files and playlists to the owner of
                 the role specified by Role , and grants no other  permissions
                 to any other user or group.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 save the transcoded files. Specify this value when all of the
                 following are true:

                 o You want to save transcoded files, thumbnails (if any), and

                   with the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.

                 If you want to save transcoded files  and  playlists  in  one
                 bucket  and thumbnails in another bucket, specify which users
                 can access the transcoded files or the permissions the  users

                 want them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum  of
                 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.

                 If  you  include Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants only
                 the permissions that you specify. It does not grant full per-
                 missions  to the owner of the role specified by Role . If you
                 want that user to have  full  control,  you  must  explicitly
                 grant full control to the user.

                 If you omit Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants full con-
                 trol over the transcoded files and playlists to the owner  of
                 the  role specified by Role , and grants no other permissions

          Using  resources in the same region, such as your Amazon S3 buckets,
          Amazon SNS notification topics, and AWS KMS key, reduces  processing
          time and prevents cross-regional charges.
