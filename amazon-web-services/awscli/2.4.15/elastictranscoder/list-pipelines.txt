LIST-PIPELINES()                                              LIST-PIPELINES()



NAME
       list-pipelines -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListPipelines  operation  gets  a list of the pipelines associated
       with the current AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-pipelines is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Pipelines

SYNOPSIS
            list-pipelines
          [--ascending <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ascending (string)
          To  list  pipelines in chronological order by the date and time that
          they were created, enter true . To list pipelines in reverse chrono-
          logical order, enter false .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          An array of Pipeline objects.

          (structure)
              The pipeline (queue) that is used to manage jobs.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  identifier for the pipeline. You use this value to iden-
                 tify the pipeline in which you want to perform a  variety  of
                 operations, such as creating a job or a preset.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the pipeline.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  pipeline.  We  recommend that the name be
                 unique  within  the  AWS  account,  but  uniqueness  is   not
                 enforced.

                 Constraints: Maximum 40 characters

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the pipeline:

                 o Active : The pipeline is processing jobs.

                 o Paused : The pipeline is not currently processing jobs.

              InputBucket -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket from which Elastic Transcoder gets media
                 files for transcoding and the graphics files,  if  any,  that
                 you want to use for watermarks.

              OutputBucket -> (string)
                 The  Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 save transcoded files, thumbnails, and playlists. Either  you
                 specify  this  value,  or  you specify both ContentConfig and
                 ThumbnailConfig .

              Role -> (string)
                 The IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the role that  Elastic
                 Transcoder uses to transcode jobs for this pipeline.

              AwsKmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that you want to
                 use with this pipeline.

                 If you use either s3 or s3-aws-kms as your Encryption:Mode  ,
                 you  don't  need  to  provide  a  key with your job because a
                 default key, known as an AWS-KMS  key,  is  created  for  you
                 automatically. You need to provide an AWS-KMS key only if you
                 want to use a non-default AWS-KMS key, or if you are using an
                 Encryption:Mode of aes-cbc-pkcs7 , aes-ctr , or aes-gcm .

              Notifications -> (structure)
                 The  Amazon  Simple  Notification  Service (Amazon SNS) topic
                 that you want to notify to report job status.

                     o READ_ACP  :  The  grantee  can  read the object ACL for
                       objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the  Amazon  S3
                       bucket.

                     o WRITE_ACP  :  The  grantee  can  write  the ACL for the

                   your Amazon S3 bucket.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder
                     to save the transcoded files. Specify this value when all
                     of the following are true:

                     o You want to save transcoded files, thumbnails (if any),
                       and playlists (if any) together in one bucket.

                     o You do not want to specify the users or groups who have
                       access  to  the  transcoded  files,   thumbnails,   and
                       playlists.

                     o You do not want to specify the permissions that Elastic
                       Transcoder grants to the files.

                     o You want to associate the transcoded files  and  thumb-
                       nails with the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.

                     If you want to save transcoded files and playlists in one
                     bucket and thumbnails in another  bucket,  specify  which
                     users  can access the transcoded files or the permissions
                     the users have, or change the Amazon  S3  storage  class,
                     omit  OutputBucket  and  specify values for ContentConfig
                     and ThumbnailConfig instead.

                 StorageClass -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 storage class,  Standard  or  ReducedRedun-
                     dancy , that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the
                     video files and playlists that it stores in  your  Amazon
                     S3 bucket.

                 Permissions -> (list)
                     Optional.  The  Permissions  object specifies which users
                     and/or predefined Amazon  S3  groups  you  want  to  have
                     access to transcoded files and playlists, and the type of
                     access you want them to have. You can  grant  permissions
                     to  a  maximum  of  30  users and/or predefined Amazon S3
                     groups.

                     If you include Permissions ,  Elastic  Transcoder  grants
                     only  the permissions that you specify. It does not grant
                     full permissions to the owner of the  role  specified  by
                     Role  .  If  you want that user to have full control, you
                     must explicitly grant full control to the user.

                     If you omit Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants  full
                     control  over  the  transcoded files and playlists to the

                       nails with the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.

                     If you want to save transcoded files and playlists in one
                     bucket  and  thumbnails  in another bucket, specify which
                     users can access the transcoded files or the  permissions
                     the  users  have,  or change the Amazon S3 storage class,

                 Permissions -> (list)
                     Optional. The Permissions object  specifies  which  users

                     access  you  want them to have. You can grant permissions
                     to a maximum of 30  users  and/or  predefined  Amazon  S3
                     groups.

                     If  you  include  Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants
                     only the permissions that you specify. It does not  grant
                     full  permissions  to  the owner of the role specified by
                     Role . If you want that user to have  full  control,  you
                     must explicitly grant full control to the user.

                     If  you omit Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants full
                     control over the transcoded files and  playlists  to  the
                     owner of the role specified by Role , and grants no other
                     permissions to any other user or group.
