CREATE-KEY-GROUP()                                          CREATE-KEY-GROUP()



NAME
       create-key-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  key  group that you can use with CloudFront signed URLs and
       signed cookies .

       To create a key group, you must specify at least one public key for the
       key  group. After you create a key group, you can reference it from one
       or more cache behaviors. When you reference a  key  group  in  a  cache
       behavior,  CloudFront  requires  signed  URLs or signed cookies for all
       requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs  or  cookies  must  be
       signed  with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key
       group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public
       key  CloudFront  should  use to verify the signature. For more informa-
       tion, see Serving private content in the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
       Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-key-group
          --key-group-config <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-group-config (structure)
          A key group configuration.

          Name -> (string)
              A name to identify the key group.

          Items -> (list)
              A list of the identifiers of the public keys in the key group.

              (string)

          Comment -> (string)
              A  comment  to  describe  the  key  group. The comment cannot be
              longer than 128 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Items=string,string,Comment=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "Items": ["string", ...],
            "Comment": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the key group was last modified.

          KeyGroupConfig -> (structure)
              The key group configuration.

              Name -> (string)

              Items -> (list)
