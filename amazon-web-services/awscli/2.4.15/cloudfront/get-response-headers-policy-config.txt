NAME
       get-response-headers-policy-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a response headers policy configuration.

       To  get  a  response headers policy configuration, you must provide the
       policys identifier. If the response headers policy  is  attached  to  a
       distributions  cache behavior, you can get the policys identifier using
       ListDistributions or GetDistribution . If the response  headers  policy
       is  not  attached to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using
       ListResponseHeadersPolicies .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-response-headers-policy-config
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier for the response headers policy.

          If the response headers policy is attached to a distributions  cache
          behavior, you can get the policys identifier using ListDistributions
          or GetDistribution . If the response headers policy is not  attached
          to  a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using ListResponse-
          HeadersPolicies .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
