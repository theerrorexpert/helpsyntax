DELETE-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()                      DELETE-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       delete-realtime-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a real-time log configuration.

       You  cannot  delete  a real-time log configuration if its attached to a
       cache behavior. First update your distributions to remove the real-time
       log  configuration  from all cache behaviors, then delete the real-time
       log configuration.

       To delete a real-time log configuration, you can provide the configura-
       tions name or its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must provide at least
       one. If you provide both, CloudFront uses  the  name  to  identify  the
       real-time log configuration to delete.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-realtime-log-config
          [--name <value>]
          [--arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the real-time log configuration to delete.

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log configuration to
          delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
