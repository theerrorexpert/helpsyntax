LIST-INVALIDATIONS()                                      LIST-INVALIDATIONS()



NAME
       list-invalidations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists invalidation batches.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-invalidations  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: InvalidationList.Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-invalidations
          --distribution-id <value>
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --distribution-id (string)
          The distribution's ID.

       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list CloudFront invalidations

       The  following  example gets a list of the invalidations for the Cloud-
       Front distribution with the ID EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE:

          aws cloudfront list-invalidations --distribution-id EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "InvalidationList": {
                  "Marker": "",
                  "Items": [
                      {
                          "Status": "Completed",
                          "Id": "YNY2LI2BVJ4NJU",
                          "CreateTime": "2019-08-31T21:15:52.042Z"
                      }
                  ],
                  "IsTruncated": false,
                  "MaxItems": 100,
                  "Quantity": 1
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       InvalidationList -> (structure)
          Information about invalidation batches.

          Marker -> (string)
              The value that you provided for the Marker request parameter.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If IsTruncated is true , this element is  present  and  contains
              the  value  that you can use for the Marker request parameter to
              continue listing your invalidation batches where they left  off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The  value that you provided for the MaxItems request parameter.

          IsTruncated -> (boolean)
              A flag that indicates whether more invalidation  batch  requests
              remain  to  be  listed.  If your results were truncated, you can
              make a follow-up pagination request  using  the  Marker  request
              parameter to retrieve more invalidation batches in the list.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of invalidation batches that were created by the cur-
              rent Amazon Web Services account.

          Items -> (list)
              A complex type that contains one InvalidationSummary element for
              each  invalidation  batch created by the current Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account.

              (structure)
                 A summary of an invalidation request.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique ID for an invalidation request.

                 CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time that an invalidation request was created.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of an invalidation request.
