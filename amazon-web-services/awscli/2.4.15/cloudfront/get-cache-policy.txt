GET-CACHE-POLICY()                                          GET-CACHE-POLICY()



NAME
       get-cache-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a cache policy, including the following metadata:

       o The policys identifier.

       o The date and time when the policy was last modified.

       To  get a cache policy, you must provide the policys identifier. If the
       cache policy is attached to a distributions cache behavior, you can get
       the  policys identifier using ListDistributions or GetDistribution . If
       the cache policy is not attached to a cache behavior, you can  get  the
       identifier using ListCachePolicies .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-cache-policy
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the cache policy. If the cache policy is
          attached to a distributions cache behavior, you can get the  policys
          identifier using ListDistributions or GetDistribution . If the cache
          policy is not attached to a cache behavior, you can get the  identi-
          fier using ListCachePolicies .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CachePolicy -> (structure)
          The cache policy.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the cache policy.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the cache policy was last modified.

          CachePolicyConfig -> (structure)
              The cache policy configuration.

              Comment -> (string)
                 A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be
                 longer than 128 characters.

              Name -> (string)
                 A unique name to identify the cache policy.

              DefaultTTL -> (long)
                 The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects
                 to  stay  in  the  CloudFront  cache  before CloudFront sends
                 another request to the origin to see if the object  has  been
                 updated.  CloudFront  uses  this value as the objects time to
                 live (TTL) only when the origin does not  send  Cache-Control
                 or Expires headers with the object. For more information, see
                 Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)
                 in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 The  default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day).
                 If the value of MinTTL is more than 86400 seconds,  then  the
                 default  value  for  this  field  is the same as the value of
                 MinTTL .

              MaxTTL -> (long)
                 The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay  in
                 the  CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request
                 to the origin to see if the object has been  updated.  Cloud-
                 Front  uses  this value only when the origin sends Cache-Con-
                 trol or Expires headers with the object.  For  more  informa-
                 tion,  see  Managing  How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache
                 (Expiration) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 The default value for this field  is  31536000  seconds  (one
                 year).  If  the  value  of  MinTTL or DefaultTTL is more than
                 31536000 seconds, then the default value for  this  field  is
                 the same as the value of DefaultTTL .

              MinTTL -> (long)
                 The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects
                 to stay in  the  CloudFront  cache  before  CloudFront  sends
                 another  request  to the origin to see if the object has been
                 updated. For more information, see Managing How Long  Content
                 Stays  in an Edge Cache (Expiration) in the Amazon CloudFront
                 Developer Guide .

              ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin -> (structure)
                 The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings  to  include
                 in  the  cache  key. The values included in the cache key are
                 automatically included in requests that CloudFront  sends  to
                 the origin.

                 EnableAcceptEncodingGzip -> (boolean)
                     A  flag  that can affect whether the Accept-Encoding HTTP
                     header is included in  the  cache  key  and  included  in
                     requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     This  field  is related to the EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli
                     field. If one or both of these fields is  true   and  the
                     viewer  request includes the Accept-Encoding header, then
                     CloudFront does the following:

                     o Normalizes the value  of  the  viewers  Accept-Encoding
                       header

                     o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                     o Includes  the  normalized  header in the request to the
                       origin, if a request is necessary

                     For more information, see Compression support in the Ama-
                     zon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     If  you  set this value to true , and this cache behavior
                     also has  an  origin  request  policy  attached,  do  not
                     include  the Accept-Encoding header in the origin request
                     policy. CloudFront always  includes  the  Accept-Encoding
                     header in origin requests when the value of this field is
                     true , so including this header in an origin request pol-
                     icy has no effect.

                     If  both  of  these  fields  are  false , then CloudFront
                     treats the Accept-Encoding header the same as  any  other
                     HTTP  header  in  the viewer request. By default, its not
                     included in the cache key and its not included in  origin
                     requests.   In   this   case,   you   can   manually  add
                     Accept-Encoding to the headers whitelist like  any  other
                     HTTP header.

                 EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli -> (boolean)
                     A  flag  that can affect whether the Accept-Encoding HTTP
                     header is included in  the  cache  key  and  included  in
                     requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     This  field  is  related  to the EnableAcceptEncodingGzip
                     field. If one or both of these fields is  true   and  the
                     viewer  request includes the Accept-Encoding header, then
                     CloudFront does the following:

                     o Normalizes the value  of  the  viewers  Accept-Encoding
                       header

                     o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                     o Includes  the  normalized  header in the request to the
                       origin, if a request is necessary

                     If  you  set this value to true , and this cache behavior
                     also has  an  origin  request  policy  attached,  do  not
                     include  the Accept-Encoding header in the origin request
                     policy. CloudFront always  includes  the  Accept-Encoding
                     header in origin requests when the value of this field is

                 HeadersConfig -> (structure)
                     An  object  that determines whether any HTTP headers (and
                     if so, which headers) are included in the cache  key  and
                     automatically  included in requests that CloudFront sends
                     to the origin.

                     HeaderBehavior -> (string)
                        Determines whether any HTTP headers  are  included  in
                        the  cache  key and automatically included in requests
                        that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

                        o none  HTTP headers are not included in the cache key
                          and are not automatically included in requests  that
                          CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field
                          is set to none , any headers that are listed  in  an
                          OriginRequestPolicy     are   included   in   origin
                          requests.

                        Items -> (list)
                            A list of HTTP header names.

                            (string)

                 CookiesConfig -> (structure)
                     An  object  that determines whether any cookies in viewer
                     requests (and if so, which cookies) are included  in  the
                     cache  key  and  automatically  included in requests that

                        included  in  the cache key and automatically included
                        in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid
