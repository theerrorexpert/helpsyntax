NAME
       get-origin-request-policy-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an origin request policy configuration.

       To  get  an  origin  request policy configuration, you must provide the
       policys identifier. If the origin request policy is attached to a  dis-
       tributions  cache  behavior,  you  can get the policys identifier using
       ListDistributions or GetDistribution . If the origin request policy  is
       not attached to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using Lis-
       tOriginRequestPolicies .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-origin-request-policy-config
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier for the origin request policy. If  the  origin
          request  policy  is  attached to a distributions cache behavior, you
          can get the policys identifier using ListDistributions or GetDistri-
          bution  .  If  the  origin request policy is not attached to a cache
          behavior, you can get the identifier using ListOriginRequestPolicies
          .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
