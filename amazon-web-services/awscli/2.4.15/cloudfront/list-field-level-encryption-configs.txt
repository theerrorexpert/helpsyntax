NAME
       list-field-level-encryption-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all  field-level encryption configurations that have been created
       in CloudFront for this account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-field-level-encryption-configs
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in  your
          list  of  configurations.  The results include configurations in the
          list that occur after the marker. To get the next page  of  results,
          set  the  Marker  to  the  value  of the NextMarker from the current
          page's response (which is also the ID of the last  configuration  on
          that page).

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of field-level encryption configurations you want
          in the response body.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
