SYNOPSIS
            create-field-level-encryption-profile
          --field-level-encryption-profile-config <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --field-level-encryption-profile-config (structure)
          The request to create a field-level encryption profile.

          Name -> (string)
              Profile name for the field-level encryption profile.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A unique number that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

          Comment -> (string)
              An optional comment for the field-level encryption profile.  The
              comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

          EncryptionEntities -> (structure)
              A  complex  data type of encryption entities for the field-level
              encryption profile that include the public key ID, provider, and
              field  patterns for specifying which fields to encrypt with this
              key.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 Number of field pattern items  in  a  field-level  encryption
                 content type-profile mapping.

              Items -> (list)
                 An  array  of field patterns in a field-level encryption con-
                 tent type-profile mapping.

                 (structure)
                     Complex data type  for  field-level  encryption  profiles
                     that includes the encryption key and field pattern speci-
                     fications.

                     PublicKeyId -> (string)
                        The public key associated with a  set  of  field-level
                        encryption  patterns,  to  be used when encrypting the
                        fields that match the patterns.

                     ProviderId -> (string)
                        The provider associated with the public key being used
                        for  encryption. This value must also be provided with
                        the private key for applications to be able to decrypt
                        data.

                     FieldPatterns -> (structure)
                        Field  patterns  in  a  field-level encryption content
                        type profile specify the fields that you  want  to  be
                        encrypted. You can provide the full field name, or any
                        beginning characters followed by a wildcard  (*).  You
                        can't  overlap  field patterns. For example, you can't
                        have both ABC* and AB*. Note that field  patterns  are
                        case-sensitive.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  field-level encryption field pat-
                            terns.

                        Items -> (list)
                            An array of the field-level encryption field  pat-
                            terns.

                            (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "CallerReference": "string",
            "Comment": "string",
            "EncryptionEntities": {
              "Quantity": integer,
              "Items": [
                {
                  "PublicKeyId": "string",
                  "ProviderId": "string",
                  "FieldPatterns": {
                    "Quantity": integer,
                    "Items": ["string", ...]
                  }
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a CloudFront field-level encryption profile

       The  following example creates a field-level encryption profile by pro-
       viding the parameters in a  JSON  file  named  fle-profile-config.json.
       Before you can create a field-level encryption profile, you must have a
       CloudFront public key.  To create a  CloudFront  public  key,  see  the
       create-public-key command.

       For more information about CloudFront field-level encryption, see Using
       Field-Level Encryption to Help Protect Sensitive  Data  in  the  Amazon
       CloudFront Developer Guide.

          aws cloudfront create-field-level-encryption-profile \
              --field-level-encryption-profile-config file://fle-profile-config.json

       folder that contains the following:
