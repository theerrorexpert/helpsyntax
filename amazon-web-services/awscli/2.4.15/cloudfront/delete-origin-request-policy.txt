NAME
       delete-origin-request-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an origin request policy.

       You cannot delete an origin request policy if its attached to any cache
       behaviors. First update your distributions to remove the origin request
       policy from all cache behaviors, then delete the origin request policy.

       To delete an origin request policy, you must provide the policys  iden-
       tifier  and  version.  To get the identifier, you can use ListOriginRe-
       questPolicies or GetOriginRequestPolicy .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-origin-request-policy
          --id <value>
          [--if-match <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier for the origin request  policy  that  you  are
          deleting.  To get the identifier, you can use ListOriginRequestPoli-
          cies .

       --if-match (string)
          The version of the origin request policy that you are deleting.  The
          version  is the origin request policys ETag value, which you can get
          using ListOriginRequestPolicies , GetOriginRequestPolicy , or  GetO-
          riginRequestPolicyConfig .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
