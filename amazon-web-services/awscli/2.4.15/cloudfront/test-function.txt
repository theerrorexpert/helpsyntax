TEST-FUNCTION()                                                TEST-FUNCTION()



NAME
       test-function -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests a CloudFront function.

       To test a function, you provide an event object that represents an HTTP
       request or response that your CloudFront distribution could receive  in
       production.  CloudFront  runs the function, passing it the event object
       that you provided, and returns the functions result (the modified event
       object)  in  the response. The response also contains function logs and
       error messages, if any exist. For more information about testing  func-
       tions, see Testing functions in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

       To test a function, you provide the functions name  and  version  (ETag
       value)  along with the event object. To get the functions name and ver-
       sion, you can use ListFunctions and DescribeFunction .

SYNOPSIS
            test-function
          --name <value>
          --if-match <value>
          [--stage <value>]
          --event-object <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the function that you are testing.

       --if-match (string)
          The current version (ETag value) of the function that you are  test-
          ing, which you can get using DescribeFunction .

       --stage (string)
          The  stage  of the function that you are testing, either DEVELOPMENT
          or LIVE .

          Possible values:

          o DEVELOPMENT

          o LIVE

       --event-object (blob)
          The event object to test the function  with.  For  more  information
          about  the  structure  of the event object, see Testing functions in
          the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TestResult -> (structure)
          An object that represents the result of running  the  function  with
          the provided event object.

          FunctionSummary -> (structure)
              Contains configuration information and metadata about the Cloud-
              Front function that was tested.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the CloudFront function.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the CloudFront function.

              FunctionConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains configuration information about a  CloudFront  func-
                 tion.

                 Comment -> (string)
                     A comment to describe the function.

                 Runtime -> (string)
                     The  functions  runtime environment. The only valid value
                     is cloudfront-js-1.0 .

              FunctionMetadata -> (structure)
                 Contains metadata about a CloudFront function.

                 FunctionARN -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.  The  ARN
                     uniquely identifies the function.

                 Stage -> (string)
                     The  stage that the function is in, either DEVELOPMENT or
                     LIVE .

                     When a function is in the DEVELOPMENT stage, you can test
                     the  function  with  TestFunction  ,  and  update it with
                     UpdateFunction .

                     When a function is in the LIVE stage, you can attach  the
                     function  to  a  distributions  cache behavior, using the
                     functions ARN.

                 CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time when the function was created.

                 LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time when the  function  was  most  recently
                     updated.

          ComputeUtilization -> (string)
              The amount of time that the function took to run as a percentage
              of the maximum allowed time. For example, a compute  utilization
              of  35  means  that the function completed in 35% of the maximum
              allowed time.

          FunctionExecutionLogs -> (list)
              Contains the log lines that the function  wrote  (if  any)  when
              running the test.

              (string)

          FunctionErrorMessage -> (string)
              If  the  result of testing the function was an error, this field
              contains the error message.

          FunctionOutput -> (string)
              The event object returned by the function. For more  information
              about the structure of the event object, see Event object struc-
              ture in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .
