NAME
       get-field-level-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       Get the field-level encryption configuration information.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-field-level-encryption
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          Request the ID for the field-level encryption configuration informa-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a CloudFront field-level encryption configuration

       The following example gets the CloudFront field-level  encryption  con-
       figuration with the ID C3KM2WVD605UAY, including its ETag:

          aws cloudfront get-field-level-encryption --id C3KM2WVD605UAY

          Id -> (string)
              The  configuration ID for a field-level encryption configuration
              which includes a set of profiles that specify  certain  selected
              data fields to be encrypted by specific public keys.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The  last  time  the  field-level  encryption  configuration was

              specified for field-level encryption.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A unique number that ensures the request can't be replayed.
