NAME
       delete-cache-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a cache policy.

       You  cannot  delete a cache policy if its attached to a cache behavior.
       First update your distributions to remove the  cache  policy  from  all
       cache behaviors, then delete the cache policy.

       To  delete  a cache policy, you must provide the policys identifier and
       version. To get these values, you can  use  ListCachePolicies  or  Get-
       CachePolicy .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-cache-policy
          --id <value>
          [--if-match <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier for the cache policy that you are deleting. To
          get the identifier, you can use ListCachePolicies .

       --if-match (string)
          The version of the cache policy that you are deleting.  The  version
          is the cache policys ETag value, which you can get using ListCacheP-
          olicies , GetCachePolicy , or GetCachePolicyConfig .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
