DELETE-FUNCTION()                                            DELETE-FUNCTION()



NAME
       delete-function -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a CloudFront function.

       You  cannot  delete a function if its associated with a cache behavior.
       First, update your distributions to  remove  the  function  association
       from all cache behaviors, then delete the function.

       To  delete  a function, you must provide the functions name and version
       (ETag value). To get  these  values,  you  can  use  ListFunctions  and
       DescribeFunction .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-function
          --name <value>
          --if-match <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the function that you are deleting.

       --if-match (string)
          The current version (ETag value) of the function that you are delet-
          ing, which you can get using DescribeFunction .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
