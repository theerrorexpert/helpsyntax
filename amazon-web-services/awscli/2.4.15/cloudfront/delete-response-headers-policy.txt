NAME
       delete-response-headers-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a response headers policy.

       You  cannot delete a response headers policy if its attached to a cache
       behavior. First update your distributions to remove the response  head-
       ers  policy  from all cache behaviors, then delete the response headers
       policy.

       To delete a response headers policy, you must provide the policys iden-
       tifier  and version. To get these values, you can use ListResponseHead-
       ersPolicies or GetResponseHeadersPolicy .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-response-headers-policy
          --id <value>
          [--if-match <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier for the response headers policy that you  are  delet-
          ing.

          To get the identifier, you can use ListResponseHeadersPolicies .

       --if-match (string)
          The version of the response headers policy that you are deleting.

          The  version  is  the response headers policys ETag value, which you
          can get using ListResponseHeadersPolicies , GetResponseHeadersPolicy
          , or GetResponseHeadersPolicyConfig .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
