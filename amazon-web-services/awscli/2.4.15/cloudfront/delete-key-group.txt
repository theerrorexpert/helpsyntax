NAME
       delete-key-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a key group.

       You  cannot  delete a key group that is referenced in a cache behavior.
       First update your distributions to remove the key group from all  cache
       behaviors, then delete the key group.

       To  delete  a key group, you must provide the key groups identifier and
       version. To get these values, use ListKeyGroups followed by GetKeyGroup
       or GetKeyGroupConfig .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-key-group
          --id <value>
          [--if-match <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the key group that you are deleting. To get the
          identifier, use ListKeyGroups .

       --if-match (string)
          The version of the key group that you are deleting. The  version  is
          the  key  groups  ETag  value.  To get the ETag , use GetKeyGroup or
          GetKeyGroupConfig .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
