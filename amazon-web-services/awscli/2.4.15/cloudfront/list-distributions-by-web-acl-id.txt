NAME
       list-distributions-by-web-acl-id -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  distributions  that  are associated with a specified WAF web
       ACL.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-distributions-by-web-acl-id
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          --web-acl-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use Marker and MaxItems to control pagination  of  results.  If  you
          have  more than MaxItems distributions that satisfy the request, the
          response includes a NextMarker element. To  get  the  next  page  of
          results,  submit  another request. For the value of Marker , specify
          the value of NextMarker from  the  last  response.  (For  the  first
          request, omit Marker .)

       --max-items (string)
          The  maximum  number  of  distributions  that you want CloudFront to
          return in the response body. The maximum and default values are both
          100.

       --web-acl-id (string)
          The  ID of the WAF web ACL that you want to list the associated dis-
          tributions. If you specify "null" for the ID, the request returns  a
          list of the distributions that aren't associated with a web ACL.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DistributionList -> (structure)
          The DistributionList type.

          Marker -> (string)
              The value you provided for the Marker request parameter.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If  IsTruncated  is  true , this element is present and contains
              the value you can use for the Marker request parameter  to  con-
              tinue listing your distributions where they left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The value you provided for the MaxItems request parameter.

          IsTruncated -> (boolean)
              A  flag  that  indicates whether more distributions remain to be
              listed. If your results were truncated, you can make a follow-up
              pagination   request  using  the  Marker  request  parameter  to
              retrieve more distributions in the list.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of distributions that were  created  by  the  current
              Amazon Web Services account.

          Items -> (list)
              A complex type that contains one DistributionSummary element for
              each distribution that was created by  the  current  Amazon  Web
              Services account.

              (structure)

                     VBD632BHDS5 .

                 ARN -> (string)
                     The  ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the distribution. For
                     example:       arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribu-
                     tion/EDFDVBD632BHDS5  , where 123456789012 is your Amazon
                     Web Services account ID.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The current status of the distribution. When  the  status
                     is  Deployed  ,  the distribution's information is propa-
                     gated to all CloudFront edge locations.

                 DomainName -> (string)
                     The domain name that corresponds to the distribution, for
                     example, d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net .

                 Aliases -> (structure)
                     A  complex  type  that  contains information about CNAMEs
                     (alternate domain names), if any, for this  distribution.

                     Quantity -> (integer)

                     Items -> (list)
                        A complex type that contains  the  CNAME  aliases,  if
                        any,  that  you  want to associate with this distribu-
                        tion.

                 Origins -> (structure)
                     A complex type that contains  information  about  origins
                     for this distribution.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of origins for this distribution.

                     Items -> (list)
                        A list of origins.

                        (structure)
                            An origin.

                            An origin is the location where content is stored,
                            and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to
                            viewers. To specify an origin:

                            o Use  S3OriginConfig  to  specify  an  Amazon  S3
                              bucket that is not configured with  static  web-
                              site hosting.

                            o Use  CustomOriginConfig  to  specify  all  other
                              kinds of origins, including:

                              o An Amazon S3 bucket that  is  configured  with
                                static website hosting

                              o An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer

                              o An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint

                              o An AWS Elemental MediaStore container

                              o Any  other  HTTP  server, running on an Amazon
                                EC2 instance or any other kind of host

                            For the current maximum number of origins that you
                            can  specify  per distribution, see General Quotas
                            on Web  Distributions  in  the  Amazon  CloudFront
                            Developer  Guide (quotas were formerly referred to
                            as limits).

                            Id -> (string)
                               A unique identifier for the origin. This  value
                               must be unique within the distribution.

                               Use this value to specify the TargetOriginId in
                               a CacheBehavior or DefaultCacheBehavior .

                            DomainName -> (string)
                               The domain name for the origin.

                               For more information, see Origin Domain Name in
                               the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            OriginPath -> (string)
                               An optional path that CloudFront appends to the
                               origin domain  name  when  CloudFront  requests
                               content from the origin.

                               For  more  information,  see Origin Path in the
                               Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            CustomHeaders -> (structure)
                               A list of HTTP header  names  and  values  that
                               CloudFront  adds  to the requests that it sends
                               to the origin.

                               For more information, see Adding Custom Headers
                               to  Origin  Requests  in  the Amazon CloudFront

                                   The number of custom headers, if  any,  for
                                   this distribution.

                               Items -> (list)
                                      Optional  :  A  list  that  contains one
                                      OriginCustomHeader element for each cus-
                                      tom  header  that you want CloudFront to
                                      forward to the origin. If Quantity is  0
                                      , omit Items .

                                   (structure)
                                      A  complex type that contains HeaderName
                                      and HeaderValue elements,  if  any,  for
                                      this distribution.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of a header that you want
                                          CloudFront to send to  your  origin.
                                          For  more  information,  see  Adding
                                          Custom Headers to Origin Requests in
                                          the   Amazon   CloudFront  Developer
                                          Guide .

                                      HeaderValue -> (string)
                                          The value for the  header  that  you
                                          specified in the HeaderName field.

                            S3OriginConfig -> (structure)
                               Use  this  type to specify an origin that is an
                               Amazon S3 bucket that is  not  configured  with
                               static  website  hosting.  To specify any other
                               type of origin, including an Amazon  S3  bucket
                               that is configured with static website hosting,
                               use the CustomOriginConfig type instead.

                               OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                                   The CloudFront origin  access  identity  to
                                   associate  with  the  origin. Use an origin
                                   access identity to configure the origin  so
                                   that  viewers can only access objects in an
                                   Amazon S3 bucket  through  CloudFront.  The
                                   format of the value is:

                                   origin-access-identity/cloud-
                                   front/ID-of-origin-access-identity

                                   where `` ID-of-origin-access-identity `` is
                                   the  value  that CloudFront returned in the
                                   ID element  when  you  created  the  origin
                                   access identity.

                                   If  you  want  viewers to be able to access
                                   objects using either the CloudFront URL  or
                                   the  Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty Origi-
                                   nAccessIdentity element.

                                   To delete the origin access  identity  from
                                   an  existing  distribution, update the dis-
                                   tribution  configuration  and  include   an
                                   empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                                   To  replace  the  origin  access  identity,
                                   update the distribution  configuration  and
                                   specify the new origin access identity.

                                   For   more  information  about  the  origin
                                   access identity, see Serving  Private  Con-
                                   tent   through  CloudFront  in  the  Amazon
                                   CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            CustomOriginConfig -> (structure)
                               Use this type to specify an origin that is  not
                               an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the
                               Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static web-
                               site  hosting,  use this type. If the Amazon S3
                               bucket is not configured  with  static  website
                               hosting, use the S3OriginConfig type instead.

                               HTTPPort -> (integer)
                                   The  HTTP port that CloudFront uses to con-
                                   nect to the origin. Specify the  HTTP  port
                                   that the origin listens on.

                               HTTPSPort -> (integer)
                                   The HTTPS port that CloudFront uses to con-
                                   nect to the origin. Specify the HTTPS  port
                                   that the origin listens on.

                               OriginProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                                   Specifies the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that
                                   CloudFront uses to connect to  the  origin.
                                   Valid values are:

                                   o http-only  CloudFront always uses HTTP to
                                     connect to the origin.

                                   o match-viewer  CloudFront connects to  the
                                     origin  using  the same protocol that the
                                     viewer used to connect to CloudFront.

                                   o https-only  CloudFront always uses  HTTPS
                                     to connect to the origin.

                                   is enabled.

                                   When  its  enabled,  CloudFront  routes all
                                   requests through Origin Shield,  which  can
                                   help  protect  your  origin.  When its dis-
                                   abled,  CloudFront  might   send   requests
                                   directly  to your origin from multiple edge
                                   locations or regional edge caches.

                               OriginShieldRegion -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Web Services Region  for  Origin
                                   Shield.

                                   Specify the Amazon Web Services Region that
                                   has the lowest latency to your  origin.  To
                                   specify  a region, use the region code, not
                                   the region name. For example,  specify  the
                                   US East (Ohio) region as us-east-2 .

                                   When  you  enable CloudFront Origin Shield,
                                   you must specify the  Amazon  Web  Services
                                   Region  for  Origin Shield. For the list of

                        The number of origin groups.

                     Items -> (list)
                        The items (origin groups) in a distribution.

                        (structure)
                            An origin group includes two  origins  (a  primary
                            origin  and  a second origin to failover to) and a
                            failover criteria that you specify. You create  an
                            origin  group to support origin failover in Cloud-
                            Front. When you create or update  a  distribution,
                            you  can  specifiy  the  origin group instead of a
                            single origin, and CloudFront will  failover  from
                            the  primary origin to the second origin under the
                            failover conditions that you've chosen.

                               the failover criteria for an origin group.

                               StatusCodes -> (structure)
                                   The  status  codes that, when returned from
                                   the primary origin, will trigger CloudFront
                                   to failover to the second origin.

                                   Quantity -> (integer)
                                      The number of status codes.

                                   Items -> (list)
                                      The  items  (status codes) for an origin
                                      group.

                                      (integer)

                            Members -> (structure)
                               A complex type that contains information  about
                               the origins in an origin group.

                               Quantity -> (integer)
                                   The number of origins in an origin group.

                               Items -> (list)
                                   Items (origins) in an origin group.

                                   (structure)
                                      An origin in an origin group.

                                      OriginId -> (string)
                                          The  ID  for  an origin in an origin
                                          group.

                 DefaultCacheBehavior -> (structure)
                     A complex type that describes the default cache  behavior
                     if  you don't specify a CacheBehavior element or if files
                     don't match any of the values of PathPattern in  CacheBe-
                     havior  elements.  You  must  create  exactly one default
                     cache behavior.

                     TargetOriginId -> (string)
                        The value of ID for the origin that  you  want  Cloud-
                        Front  to  route requests to when they use the default
                        cache behavior.

                            TrustedSigners .

                        A list of Amazon Web Services account IDs whose public
                        keys CloudFront can use to  validate  signed  URLs  or
                        signed cookies.

                        When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, Cloud-
                        Front requires signed URLs or signed cookies  for  all
                        requests  that  match  the cache behavior. The URLs or
                        cookies must be signed  with  the  private  key  of  a
                        CloudFront  key  pair  in a trusted signers Amazon Web
                        Services account. The signed URL  or  cookie  contains
                        information  about  which public key CloudFront should
                        use to verify the signature. For more information, see

                        When  a  cache  behavior  contains trusted key groups,
                        CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies  for
                        all  requests  that match the cache behavior. The URLs
                        or cookies must be signed with  a  private  key  whose
                        corresponding  public  key  is  in  the key group. The
                        signed URL or cookie contains information about  which

                     ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                        The protocol that viewers can use to access the  files
                        in  the  origin  specified  by  TargetOriginId  when a
                        request matches the path pattern in PathPattern .  You
                        can specify the following options:

                        o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                        o redirect-to-https  :  If  a  viewer  submits an HTTP
                          request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status  code  of
                          301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the
                          HTTPS URL. The viewer  then  resubmits  the  request
                          using the new URL.

                        o https-only  :  If  a  viewer  sends an HTTP request,
                          CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403  (For-
                          bidden).

                        col, see Requiring HTTPS Between  Viewers  and  Cloud-
                        Front in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        NOTE:
                            The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an
                            object that was  fetched  from  the  origin  using
                            HTTPS  is never to use any other protocol to fetch
                            the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP
                            to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects
                            cache because cached objects are  protocol  agnos-
                            tic.  That means that an edge location will return
                            an object from the cache regardless of whether the
                            current request protocol matches the protocol used
                            previously. For  more  information,  see  Managing
                            Cache  Expiration  in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-

                     AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                        A complex type that controls which HTTP methods Cloud-
                        Front  processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket
                        or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                        o CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.

                        o CloudFront forwards only GET , HEAD  ,  and  OPTIONS
                          requests.

                        o CloudFront  forwards GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH,
                          POST , and DELETE requests.

                        If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict
                        access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom ori-
                        gin so users can't perform operations that  you  don't
                        want them to. For example, you might not want users to
                        have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of HTTP methods that  you  want  Cloud-
                            Front  to forward to your origin. Valid values are
                            2 (for GET and HEAD requests), 3 (for GET , HEAD ,
                            and  OPTIONS  requests)  and  7  (for  GET,  HEAD,
                            OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST , and DELETE  requests).

                        Items -> (list)
                            A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that
                            you want CloudFront to process and forward to your
                            origin.

                            (string)

                        CachedMethods -> (structure)
                            A  complex  type  that controls whether CloudFront
                            caches the response to requests using  the  speci-
                            fied HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                            o CloudFront  caches  responses  to  GET  and HEAD
                              requests.

                            o CloudFront caches responses to GET , HEAD ,  and
                              OPTIONS requests.

                            If  you  pick the second choice for your Amazon S3
                            Origin,  you  may  need  to  forward   Access-Con-
                            trol-Request-Method,  Access-Control-Request-Head-
                            ers, and Origin headers for the  responses  to  be
                            cached correctly.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The  number  of HTTP methods for which you want
                               CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are
                               2  (for  caching  responses  to  GET  and  HEAD
                               requests) and 3 (for caching responses to GET ,
                               HEAD , and OPTIONS requests).

                            Items -> (list)
                               A  complex  type that contains the HTTP methods
                               that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                               (string)

                     SmoothStreaming -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  you want to distribute media files
                        in the Microsoft Smooth  Streaming  format  using  the
                        origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If
                        so, specify true ; if not,  specify  false  .  If  you
                        specify  true for SmoothStreaming , you can still dis-
                        tribute other content using this cache behavior if the
                        content matches the value of PathPattern .

                     Compress -> (boolean)
                        Whether  you want CloudFront to automatically compress
                        certain files for this cache behavior. If so,  specify
                        true  ;  if not, specify false . For more information,
                        see Serving Compressed Files in the Amazon  CloudFront
                        Developer Guide .

                     LambdaFunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                        A  complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge
                        function associations for a cache behavior.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of  Lambda@Edge  function  associations
                            for this cache behavior.

                        Items -> (list)
                               Optional : A complex type that contains Lambda-
                               FunctionAssociation items for this cache behav-
                               ior. If Quantity is 0 , you can omit Items .

                            (structure)
                               A  complex  type  that  contains  a Lambda@Edge
                               function association.

                               LambdaFunctionARN -> (string)
                                   The ARN of the  Lambda@Edge  function.  You
                                   must specify the ARN of a function version;
                                   you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                               EventType -> (string)
                                   Specifies the event type  that  triggers  a
                                   Lambda@Edge  function  invocation.  You can
                                   specify the following values:

                                   o viewer-request :  The  function  executes
                                     when CloudFront receives a request from a
                                     viewer  and  before  it  checks  to   see
                                     whether  the  requested  object is in the
                                     edge cache.

                                   o origin-request :  The  function  executes
                                     only  when  CloudFront sends a request to
                                     your origin. When the requested object is
                                     in  the  edge cache, the function doesn't
                                     execute.

                                   o origin-response : The  function  executes
                                     after CloudFront receives a response from
                                     the  origin  and  before  it  caches  the
                                     object   in   the   response.   When  the
                                     requested object is in  the  edge  cache,
                                     the function doesn't execute.

                                   o viewer-response  :  The function executes
                                     before CloudFront returns  the  requested
                                     object  to  the viewer. The function exe-
                                     cutes regardless of  whether  the  object
                                     was  already  in  the  edge cache. If the
                                     origin returns an HTTP status code  other
                                     than  HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't
                                     execute.

                               IncludeBody -> (boolean)
                                   A flag that allows a  Lambda@Edge  function
                                   to  have  read  access to the body content.
                                   For more  information,  see  Accessing  the
                                   Request  Body  by Choosing the Include Body

                     FunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                        A  list  of  CloudFront  functions that are associated
                        with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be
                        published  to  the LIVE stage to associate them with a
                        cache behavior.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of CloudFront functions in the list.

                        Items -> (list)
                            The CloudFront functions that are associated  with
                            a  cache  behavior  in  a CloudFront distribution.
                            CloudFront functions must be published to the LIVE
                            stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                            (structure)
                               A CloudFront function that is associated with a
                               cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution.

                               FunctionARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the func-
                                   tion.

                               EventType -> (string)
                                   The  event  type  of  the  function, either
                                   viewer-request  or  viewer-response  .  You
                                   cannot  use origin-facing event types (ori-
                                   gin-request and origin-response  )  with  a
                                   CloudFront function.

                     FieldLevelEncryptionId -> (string)
                        The value of ID for the field-level encryption config-
                        uration that you want CloudFront to use for encrypting
                        specific  fields  of data for the default cache behav-
                        ior.

                     RealtimeLogConfigArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  real-time  log
                        configuration that is attached to this cache behavior.
                        For more information, see Real-time logs in the Amazon
                        CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     CachePolicyId -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier  of  the  cache policy that is
                        attached to  the  default  cache  behavior.  For  more
                        information,  see Creating cache policies or Using the
                        managed cache policies in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
                        oper Guide .

                        A DefaultCacheBehavior must include either a CachePol-
                        icyId or ForwardedValues . We recommend that you use a
                        CachePolicyId .

                     OriginRequestPolicyId -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier  of  the origin request policy
                        that is attached to the default  cache  behavior.  For
                        more information, see Creating origin request policies
                        or Using the managed origin request  policies  in  the

                     ResponseHeadersPolicyId -> (string)
                        The identifier for a response headers policy.

                     ForwardedValues -> (structure)
                        This  field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a
                        cache policy or an origin request  policy  instead  of
                        this  field.  For  more  information, see Working with
                        policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        If you want to include values in the cache key, use  a
                        cache policy. For more information, see Creating cache
                        policies or Using the managed cache  policies  in  the
                        Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        If  you  want  to  send  values  to the origin but not
                        include them in the cache key, use an  origin  request
                        policy.  For  more  information,  see  Creating origin
                        request policies or Using the managed  origin  request
                        policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        A DefaultCacheBehavior must include either a CachePol-
                        icyId or ForwardedValues . We recommend that you use a
                        CachePolicyId .

                        A  complex  type that specifies how CloudFront handles
                        query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                        QueryString -> (boolean)
                            This field is deprecated. We  recommend  that  you
                            use  a  cache  policy  or an origin request policy
                            instead of this field.

                            If you want to include query strings in the  cache
                            key, use a cache policy. For more information, see
                            Creating cache policies in the  Amazon  CloudFront

                            If  you  want  to send query strings to the origin
                            but not include them in the cache key, use an ori-
                            gin  request  policy.  For  more  information, see
                            Creating origin request  policies  in  the  Amazon

                            Indicates  whether  you want CloudFront to forward
                            query strings to the  origin  that  is  associated
                            with  this  cache  behavior and cache based on the
                            query  string  parameters.   CloudFront   behavior
                            depends  on  the  value  of QueryString and on the
                            values that you specify for QueryStringCacheKeys ,
                            if any:

                            If  you specify true for QueryString and you don't
                            specify  any  values  for  QueryStringCacheKeys  ,
                            CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to
                            the origin and caches based on  all  query  string
                            parameters.  Depending  on  how  many query string
                            parameters and values you have, this can adversely
                            affect performance because CloudFront must forward
                            more requests to the origin.

                            If you specify true for QueryString and you  spec-
                            ify  one or more values for QueryStringCacheKeys ,
                            CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to
                            the  origin, but it only caches based on the query
                            string parameters that you specify.

                            If you specify false for QueryString ,  CloudFront
                            doesn't forward any query string parameters to the
                            origin, and doesn't cache based  on  query  string
                            parameters.

                 CacheBehaviors -> (structure)
                     A complex type that contains zero or  more  CacheBehavior
                     elements.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of cache behaviors for this distribution.

                     Items -> (list)
                        Optional: A complex type that contains cache behaviors
                        for this distribution. If Quantity is 0 , you can omit
                        Items .

                        (structure)
                            A  complex type that describes how CloudFront pro-
                            cesses requests.

                            You must create at least as many  cache  behaviors
                            (including the default cache behavior) as you have
                            origins if you want CloudFront  to  serve  objects
                            from all of the origins. Each cache behavior spec-
                            ifies the one origin from which  you  want  Cloud-
                            Front  to get objects. If you have two origins and
                            only the default cache behavior, the default cache
                            behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from
                            one of the origins, but the other origin is  never
                            used.

                            For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on
                            the number of cache behaviors that you can add  to
                            a  distribution,  see  Quotas in the Amazon Cloud-
                            Front Developer Guide .

                            If you dont want to specify any  cache  behaviors,
                            include only an empty CacheBehaviors element. Dont
                            include an  empty  CacheBehavior  element  because
                            this is invalid.

                            To  delete all cache behaviors in an existing dis-
                            tribution, update the  distribution  configuration
                            and  include only an empty CacheBehaviors element.

                            To add, change, or remove one or more cache behav-
                            iors,  update  the  distribution configuration and
                            specify all of the cache behaviors that  you  want
                            to include in the updated distribution.

                            For  more  information  about cache behaviors, see
                            Cache Behavior Settings in the  Amazon  CloudFront

                            PathPattern -> (string)
                               The  pattern  (for example, images/*.jpg ) that
                               specifies which requests to apply the  behavior
                               to.  When CloudFront receives a viewer request,
                               the requested path is compared with  path  pat-
                               terns in the order in which cache behaviors are
                               listed in the distribution.

                               NOTE:
                                   You can optionally include a slash (/ )  at
                                   the  beginning  of  the  path  pattern. For
                                   example, /images/*.jpg . CloudFront  behav-
                                   ior is the same with or without the leading
                                   / .

                               The path pattern for the default cache behavior
                               is  * and cannot be changed. If the request for
                               an object does not match the path  pattern  for
                               any  cache  behaviors,  CloudFront  applies the
                               behavior in the default cache behavior.

                               For more information, see Path Pattern  in  the
                               Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            TargetOriginId -> (string)
                               The  value  of  ID for the origin that you want
                               CloudFront to route requests to when they match
                               this cache behavior.

                            TrustedSigners -> (structure)

                               WARNING:
                                   We recommend using TrustedKeyGroups instead
                                   of TrustedSigners .

                               A list of Amazon Web Services account IDs whose
                               public  keys  CloudFront  can  use  to validate

                               When a cache behavior contains trusted signers,
                               CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cook-
                               ies for  all  requests  that  match  the  cache
                               behavior.  The  URLs  or cookies must be signed
                               with the private key of a CloudFront  key  pair
                               in  the  trusted  signers  Amazon  Web Services
                               account. The  signed  URL  or  cookie  contains
                               information  about  which public key CloudFront
                               should use to verify the  signature.  For  more

                               Enabled -> (boolean)
                                   This field is true if any of the Amazon Web

                               validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                               When  a  cache  behavior  contains  trusted key
                               groups,  CloudFront  requires  signed  URLs  or
                               signed  cookies for all requests that match the
                               cache behavior. The URLs  or  cookies  must  be
                               signed  with  a private key whose corresponding
                               public key is in the key group. The signed  URL
                               or cookie contains information about which pub-
                               lic key CloudFront should  use  to  verify  the
                               signature.  For  more  information, see Serving

                            ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                               The protocol that viewers can use to access the
                               files in the origin specified by TargetOriginId
                               when  a  request  matches  the  path pattern in
                               PathPattern . You  can  specify  the  following
                               options:

                               o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                               o redirect-to-https  :  If  a viewer submits an
                                 HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP sta-
                                 tus  code  of  301 (Moved Permanently) to the
                                 viewer along with the HTTPS URL.  The  viewer
                                 then resubmits the request using the new URL.

                               o https-only  :  If  a  viewer  sends  an  HTTP
                                 request,  CloudFront  returns  an HTTP status
                                 code of 403 (Forbidden).

                               For more information about requiring the  HTTPS

                               NOTE:
                                   The  only  way  to  guarantee  that viewers
                                   retrieve an object that  was  fetched  from
                                   the  origin using HTTPS is never to use any
                                   other protocol to fetch the object. If  you
                                   have  recently  changed from HTTP to HTTPS,
                                   we recommend that you  clear  your  objects
                                   cache  because  cached objects are protocol
                                   agnostic. That means that an edge  location
                                   will   return  an  object  from  the  cache
                                   regardless of whether the  current  request
                                   protocol  matches  the protocol used previ-
                                   ously. For more information,  see  Managing

                            AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                               A complex type that controls which HTTP methods
                               CloudFront  processes and forwards to your Ama-
                               zon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There  are
                               three choices:

                               o CloudFront   forwards   only   GET  and  HEAD
                                 requests.

                               o CloudFront forwards only GET  ,  HEAD  ,  and
                                 OPTIONS requests.

                               o CloudFront  forwards GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT,
                                 PATCH, POST , and DELETE requests.

                               If you pick the third choice, you may  need  to
                               restrict  access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to
                               your custom origin so users can't perform oper-
                               ations  that  you don't want them to. For exam-
                               ple, you might not want users to  have  permis-
                               sions to delete objects from your origin.

                               Quantity -> (integer)
                                   The  number  of  HTTP methods that you want
                                   CloudFront to forward to your origin. Valid
                                   values are 2 (for GET and HEAD requests), 3
                                   (for GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS requests) and
                                   7 (for GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST
                                   , and DELETE requests).

                               Items -> (list)
                                   A complex type that contains the HTTP meth-
                                   ods that you want CloudFront to process and
                                   forward to your origin.

                                   (string)

                               CachedMethods -> (structure)
                                   A complex type that controls whether Cloud-
                                   Front caches the response to requests using
                                   the specified HTTP methods. There  are  two
                                   choices:

                                   o CloudFront  caches  responses  to GET and
                                     HEAD requests.

                                   o CloudFront caches responses to GET , HEAD
                                     , and OPTIONS requests.

                                          tion version; you can't  specify  an
                                          alias or $LATEST.

                                      EventType -> (string)
                                          Specifies  the event type that trig-
                                          gers a Lambda@Edge function  invoca-
                                          tion.  You can specify the following
                                          values:

                                          o viewer-request : The function exe-
                                            cutes  when  CloudFront receives a
                                            request from a viewer  and  before
                                            it   checks  to  see  whether  the
                                            requested object is  in  the  edge
                                            cache.

                                          o origin-request : The function exe-
                                            cutes only when CloudFront sends a
                                            request  to  your origin. When the
                                            requested object is  in  the  edge
                                            cache,  the  function doesn't exe-
                                            cute.

                                          o origin-response  :  The   function
                                            executes after CloudFront receives
                                            a response  from  the  origin  and
                                            before it caches the object in the
                                            response.   When   the   requested
                                            object  is  in the edge cache, the
                                            function doesn't execute.

                                          o viewer-response  :  The   function
                                            executes before CloudFront returns
                                            the  requested   object   to   the
                                            viewer.   The   function  executes
                                            regardless of whether  the  object
                                            was  already in the edge cache. If
                                            the origin returns an HTTP  status
                                            code other than HTTP 200 (OK), the
                                            function doesn't execute.

                                   distribution. CloudFront functions must  be
                                   published  to  the  LIVE stage to associate
                                   them with a cache behavior.

                               QueryString -> (boolean)
                                   This field is deprecated. We recommend that
                                   you use a cache policy or an origin request
                                   policy instead of this field.

                                   If you want to include query strings in the

                                   Indicates  whether  you  want CloudFront to
                                   forward query strings to the origin that is
                                   associated  with  this  cache  behavior and
                                   cache based on the query string parameters.
                                   CloudFront behavior depends on the value of
                                   QueryString and  on  the  values  that  you
                                   specify for QueryStringCacheKeys , if any:

                                   If you specify true for QueryString and you
                                   don't specify any values  for  QueryString-
                                   CacheKeys  ,  CloudFront forwards all query
                                   string parameters to the origin and  caches
                                   based   on  all  query  string  parameters.
                                   Depending on how many query string  parame-
                                   ters   and   values   you  have,  this  can
                                   adversely affect performance because Cloud-
                                   Front  must  forward  more  requests to the
                                   origin.

                                   If you specify true for QueryString and you
                                   specify one or more values for QueryString-
                                   CacheKeys , CloudFront forwards  all  query
                                   string  parameters  to  the  origin, but it
                                   only  caches  based  on  the  query  string
                                   parameters that you specify.

                                   If  you  specify  false  for  QueryString ,
                                   CloudFront doesn't forward any query string
                                   parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache
                                   based on query string parameters.

                            ErrorCode -> (integer)
                               The HTTP status code  for  which  you  want  to
                               specify  a  custom  error page and/or a caching
                               duration.

                            ResponsePagePath -> (string)
                               The path to the custom error page that you want
                               CloudFront to return to a viewer when your ori-
                               gin returns the HTTP status code  specified  by
                               ErrorCode  ,  for example, /4xx-errors/403-for-
                               bidden.html . If you want to store your objects
                               and  your custom error pages in different loca-
                               tions, your distribution must include  a  cache
                               behavior for which the following is true:

                               o The  value of PathPattern matches the path to
                                 your custom error messages. For example, sup-
                                 pose  you  saved  custom  error pages for 4xx
                                 errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a  directory
                                 named  /4xx-errors  .  Your distribution must
                                 include a cache behavior for which  the  path
                                 pattern routes requests for your custom error
                                 pages  to   that   location,   for   example,
                                 /4xx-errors/* .

                               o The  value  of  TargetOriginId  specifies the
                                 value of the ID element for the  origin  that
                                 contains your custom error pages.

                               If  you  specify a value for ResponsePagePath ,
                               you must also specify a value for  ResponseCode
                               .

                               We  recommend that you store custom error pages
                               in an Amazon S3 bucket.  If  you  store  custom
                               error  pages  on  an HTTP server and the server
                               starts to return 5xx errors,  CloudFront  can't
                               get  the files that you want to return to view-
                               ers because the origin server is unavailable.

                            ResponseCode -> (string)
                               The HTTP status code that you  want  CloudFront
                               to  return  to the viewer along with the custom
                               error page. There are a variety of reasons that
                               you  might  want  CloudFront to return a status
                               code different from the status code  that  your
                               origin returned to CloudFront, for example:

                               o Some  Internet  devices  (some  firewalls and
                                 corporate  proxies,  for  example)  intercept
                                 HTTP  4xx  and  5xx  and prevent the response
                                 from being returned to  the  viewer.  If  you
                                 substitute 200 , the response typically won't
                                 be intercepted.

                               o If you don't care about distinguishing  among
                                 different client errors or server errors, you
                                 can specify 400 or 500  as  the  ResponseCode
                                 for all 4xx or 5xx errors.

                               o You  might  want  to return a 200 status code
                                 (OK) and static  website  so  your  customers
                                 don't know that your website is down.

                               If  you  specify a value for ResponseCode , you
                               must also specify a value for  ResponsePagePath
                               .

                            ErrorCachingMinTTL -> (long)
                               The  minimum  amount  of time, in seconds, that
                               you want CloudFront to cache  the  HTTP  status
                               code  specified  in  ErrorCode . When this time
                               period has  elapsed,  CloudFront  queries  your
                               origin  to  see whether the problem that caused
                               the error has been resolved and  the  requested
                               object is now available.

                 PriceClass -> (string)
                     A complex type  that  contains  information  about  price
                     class for this streaming distribution.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Whether  the  distribution  is  enabled  to  accept  user
                     requests for content.

                 ViewerCertificate -> (structure)
                     A complex type that determines the distributions  SSL/TLS
                     configuration for communicating with viewers.

                     CloudFrontDefaultCertificate -> (boolean)
                        If  the  distribution  uses the CloudFront domain name
                        such as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net , set this field
                        to true .

                        If  the  distribution  uses  Aliases (alternate domain
                        names or CNAMEs), set this field to false and  specify
                        values for the following fields:

                        o ACMCertificateArn  or  IAMCertificateId  (specify  a
                          value for one, not both)

                        o MinimumProtocolVersion

                        o SSLSupportMethod

                     IAMCertificateId -> (string)
                        If the distribution  uses  Aliases  (alternate  domain
                        names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored
                        in Identity and Access Management (IAM) , provide  the
                        ID of the IAM certificate.

                        If  you  specify  an IAM certificate ID, you must also
                        specify values for MinimumProtocolVersion and  SSLSup-
                        portMethod .

                     ACMCertificateArn -> (string)
                        If  the  distribution  uses  Aliases (alternate domain
                        names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored
                        in  Certificate  Manager  (ACM)  ,  provide the Amazon
                        Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront
                        only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Vir-
                        ginia) Region (us-east-1 ).

                        If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you  must  also
                        specify  values for MinimumProtocolVersion and SSLSup-
                        portMethod .

                     SSLSupportMethod -> (string)
                        If the distribution  uses  Aliases  (alternate  domain
                        names  or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribu-
                        tion accepts HTTPS connections from.

                        o sni-only  The distribution accepts HTTPS connections
                          from  only  viewers that support server name indica-
                          tion (SNI) . This is recommended. Most browsers  and
                          clients support SNI.

                        o vip  The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from
                          all viewers including those that dont  support  SNI.
                          This  is  not recommended, and results in additional
                          monthly charges from CloudFront.

                        o static-ip - Do not specify this  value  unless  your
                          distribution  has  been  enabled for this feature by
                          the CloudFront team. If you have  a  use  case  that
                          requires  static  IP  addresses  for a distribution,
                          contact CloudFront through the Amazon  Web  Services
                          Support Center .

                        If  the  distribution  uses the CloudFront domain name
                        such as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net  ,  dont  set  a
                        value for this field.

                     MinimumProtocolVersion -> (string)
                        If  the  distribution  uses  Aliases (alternate domain
                        names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you
                        want  CloudFront  to  use  for  HTTPS connections with
                        viewers. The security policy determines two settings:

                        o The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use
                          to communicate with viewers.

                        o The  ciphers  that CloudFront can use to encrypt the
                          content that it returns to viewers.

                        For  more  information,  see   Security   Policy   and
                        Supported  Protocols  and  Ciphers Between Viewers and
                        CloudFront in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide  .

                        NOTE:
                            On  the CloudFront console, this setting is called
                            Security Policy .

                        When youre using SNI only (you set SSLSupportMethod to
                        sni-only ), you must specify TLSv1 or higher.

                        If  the  distribution  uses the CloudFront domain name
                        such as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net (you set  Cloud-
                        FrontDefaultCertificate to true ), CloudFront automat-
                        ically sets the security policy to TLSv1 regardless of
                        the value that you set here.

                     Certificate -> (string)
                        This  field  is  deprecated.  Use one of the following
                        fields instead:

                        o ACMCertificateArn

                        o IAMCertificateId

                        o CloudFrontDefaultCertificate

                     CertificateSource -> (string)
                        This field is deprecated. Use  one  of  the  following
                        fields instead:

                        o ACMCertificateArn

                        o IAMCertificateId

                        o CloudFrontDefaultCertificate

                 Restrictions -> (structure)
                     A  complex type that identifies ways in which you want to
                     restrict distribution of your content.

                     GeoRestriction -> (structure)
                        A complex type that controls the  countries  in  which
                        your content is distributed. CloudFront determines the
                        location of your users using MaxMind GeoIP  databases.

                        RestrictionType -> (string)
                            The  method  that you want to use to restrict dis-
                            tribution of your content by country:

                            o none : No geo restriction  is  enabled,  meaning
                              access  to  content  is not restricted by client
                              geo location.

                            o blacklist : The Location  elements  specify  the
                              countries  in which you don't want CloudFront to
                              distribute your content.

                            o whitelist : The Location  elements  specify  the
                              countries  in  which you want CloudFront to dis-
                              tribute your content.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            When geo restriction is enabled , this is the num-
                            ber  of countries in your whitelist or blacklist .
                            Otherwise, when it is not enabled, Quantity is 0 ,
                            and you can omit Items .

                        Items -> (list)
                            A  complex  type  that contains a Location element
                            for each country  in  which  you  want  CloudFront
                            either  to distribute your content (whitelist ) or
                            not distribute your content (blacklist ).

                            The Location element is  a  two-letter,  uppercase
                            country  code  for  a  country  that  you  want to
                            include in your blacklist or whitelist  .  Include
                            one Location element for each country.

                            CloudFront  and  MaxMind both use ISO 3166 country
                            codes. For the current list of countries  and  the
                            corresponding  codes,  see ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code
                            on the International Organization for Standardiza-
                            tion  website.  You  can also refer to the country
                            list on the  CloudFront  console,  which  includes
                            both country names and codes.

                            (string)

                 WebACLId -> (string)
                     The Web ACL Id (if any) associated with the distribution.

                 HttpVersion -> (string)
                     Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to
                     use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for
                     new web distributions is http2 . Viewers that don't  sup-
                     port HTTP/2 will automatically use an earlier version.

                 IsIPV6Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Whether  CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with an
                     IPv6 address for your distribution.

                 AliasICPRecordals -> (list)
                     Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file
                     for  an  Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they
                     want to serve content publicly  on  an  alternate  domain
                     name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to Cloud-
                     Front. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal  status
                     for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

                     For  more  information  about  ICP recordals, see Signup,
                     Accounts, and Credentials in Getting Started with  Amazon

                     (structure)
                        Amazon  Web  Services services in China customers must
                        file for an Internet Content Provider  (ICP)  recordal
                        if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate
                        domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added
                        to   CloudFront.  AliasICPRecordal  provides  the  ICP
                        recordal status for CNAMEs associated  with  distribu-
                        tions.  The  status  is  returned  in  the  CloudFront
                        response; you can't configure it yourself.

                        For more information about ICP recordals, see  Signup,
                        Accounts, and Credentials in Getting Started with Ama-
                        zon Web Services services in China .

                        CNAME -> (string)
                            A domain name associated with a distribution.

                        ICPRecordalStatus -> (string)
                            The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal  sta-
                            tus  for  a CNAME. The ICPRecordalStatus is set to
                            APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions  out-
                            side of China.

                            The status values returned are the following:

                            o APPROVED indicates that the associated CNAME has
                              a valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can
                              be  associated  with  a distribution, and CNAMEs
                              can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be
                              marked  as  APPROVED, that is, valid to use with
                              China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal
                              number associated with it.

                            o SUSPENDED  indicates  that  the associated CNAME
                              does not have a valid ICP recordal number.

                            o PENDING indicates that CloudFront  can't  deter-
                              mine  the ICP recordal status of the CNAME asso-
                              ciated with the distribution because  there  was
                              an  error in trying to determine the status. You
                              can try again to see if the error is resolved in
                              which  case  CloudFront  returns  an APPROVED or
                              SUSPENDED status.
