CREATE-ORIGIN-REQUEST-POLICY()                  CREATE-ORIGIN-REQUEST-POLICY()



NAME
       create-origin-request-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an origin request policy.

       After  you create an origin request policy, you can attach it to one or
       more cache behaviors. When its attached to a cache behavior, the origin
       request  policy  determines  the  values  that  CloudFront  includes in
       requests that it sends to the  origin.  Each  request  that  CloudFront
       sends to the origin includes the following:

       o The  request body and the URL path (without the domain name) from the
         viewer request.

       o The headers that CloudFront automatically includes  in  every  origin
         request, including Host , User-Agent , and X-Amz-Cf-Id .

       o All  HTTP  headers, cookies, and URL query strings that are specified
         in the cache policy or the origin request policy. These  can  include
         items from the viewer request and, in the case of headers, additional
         ones that are added by CloudFront.

       CloudFront sends a request when it cant find  a  valid  object  in  its
       cache  that matches the request. If you want to send values to the ori-
       gin and also include them in the cache key, use CachePolicy .

       For more information about origin  request  policies,  see  Controlling
       origin requests in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
