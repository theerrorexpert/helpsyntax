OPTIONS
       --field-level-encryption-profile-config (structure)
          Request to update a field-level encryption profile.

          Name -> (string)
              Profile name for the field-level encryption profile.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A unique number that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

          Comment -> (string)
              An optional comment for the field-level encryption profile.  The
              comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

          EncryptionEntities -> (structure)
              A  complex  data type of encryption entities for the field-level
              encryption profile that include the public key ID, provider, and
              field  patterns for specifying which fields to encrypt with this
              key.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 Number of field pattern items  in  a  field-level  encryption
                 content type-profile mapping.

              Items -> (list)
                 An  array  of field patterns in a field-level encryption con-
                 tent type-profile mapping.

                 (structure)
                     Complex data type  for  field-level  encryption  profiles
                     that includes the encryption key and field pattern speci-
                     fications.

                     PublicKeyId -> (string)
                        The public key associated with a  set  of  field-level
                        encryption  patterns,  to  be used when encrypting the
                        fields that match the patterns.

                     ProviderId -> (string)
                        The provider associated with the public key being used
                        for  encryption. This value must also be provided with
                        the private key for applications to be able to decrypt
                        data.

                     FieldPatterns -> (structure)
                        Field  patterns  in  a  field-level encryption content
                        type profile specify the fields that you  want  to  be
                        encrypted. You can provide the full field name, or any
                        beginning characters followed by a wildcard  (*).  You
                        can't  overlap  field patterns. For example, you can't
                        have both ABC* and AB*. Note that field  patterns  are
                        case-sensitive.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  field-level encryption field pat-
                            terns.

                        Items -> (list)
                            An array of the field-level encryption field  pat-
                            terns.

                            (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "CallerReference": "string",
            "Comment": "string",
            "EncryptionEntities": {
              "Quantity": integer,
              "Items": [
                {
                  "PublicKeyId": "string",
                  "ProviderId": "string",
                  "FieldPatterns": {
                    "Quantity": integer,
                    "Items": ["string", ...]
                  }
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
          }

       --id (string)
          The ID of the field-level encryption profile request.

       --if-match (string)
          The  value  of the ETag header that you received when retrieving the
          profile identity to update. For example: E2QWRUHAPOMQZL .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a CloudFront field-level encryption profile

       The following example updates the field-level encryption  profile  with
       the  ID PPK0UOSIF5WSV. This example updates the profile's Name and Com-
       ment, and adds a second FieldPatterns item, by providing the parameters
       in a JSON file.

       To update a field-level encryption profile, you must have the profile's
       ID  and  ETag.  The   ID   is   returned   in   the   output   of   the
       create-field-level-encryption-profile                               and
       list-field-level-encryption-profiles commands.  To get  the  ETag,  use
       the                get-field-level-encryption-profile                or
       get-field-level-encryption-profile-config command.  Use the  --if-match
       option to provide the profile's ETag.

          aws cloudfront update-field-level-encryption-profile \
              --id PPK0UOSIF5WSV \
              --if-match E1QQG65FS2L2GC \
              --field-level-encryption-profile-config file://fle-profile-config.json

       The  file  fle-profile-config.json  is  a  JSON document in the current
       directory that contains the following:

          {
              "Name": "ExampleFLEProfileUpdated",
              "CallerReference": "cli-example",
              "Comment": "Updated FLE profile for AWS CLI example",
              "EncryptionEntities": {
                  "Quantity": 1,
                  "Items": [
                      {
                          "PublicKeyId": "K2K8NC4HVFE3M0",
                          "ProviderId": "ExampleFLEProvider",
                          "FieldPatterns": {
                              "Quantity": 2,
                              "Items": [
                                  "ExampleSensitiveField",
                                  "SecondExampleSensitiveField"
                              ]
                          }
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ETag": "EJETYFJ9CL66D",
              "FieldLevelEncryptionProfile": {
