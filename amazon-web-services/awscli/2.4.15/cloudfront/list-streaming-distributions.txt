LIST-STREAMING-DISTRIBUTIONS()                  LIST-STREAMING-DISTRIBUTIONS()



NAME
       list-streaming-distributions -

DESCRIPTION
       List streaming distributions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-streaming-distributions  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: StreamingDistributionList.Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-streaming-distributions
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StreamingDistributionList -> (structure)
          The StreamingDistributionList type.

          Marker -> (string)
              The value you provided for the Marker request parameter.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If  IsTruncated  is  true , this element is present and contains
              the value you can use for the Marker request parameter  to  con-
              tinue listing your RTMP distributions where they left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The value you provided for the MaxItems request parameter.

          IsTruncated -> (boolean)
              A  flag  that  indicates  whether  more  streaming distributions
              remain to be listed. If your results  were  truncated,  you  can
              make  a  follow-up  pagination  request using the Marker request
              parameter to retrieve more distributions in the list.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of streaming distributions that were created  by  the
              current Amazon Web Services account.

          Items -> (list)
              A  complex  type  that contains one StreamingDistributionSummary
              element for each distribution that was created  by  the  current
              Amazon Web Services account.

              (structure)
                 A  summary of the information for a CloudFront streaming dis-
                 tribution.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The identifier for the distribution, for  example,  EDFD-
                     VBD632BHDS5 .

                 ARN -> (string)
                     The  ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the streaming distri-
                     bution.        For        example:         arn:aws:cloud-
                     front::123456789012:streaming-distribution/EDFD-
                     VBD632BHDS5 , where 123456789012 is your Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices account ID.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Indicates  the  current  status of the distribution. When
                     the status is Deployed , the  distribution's  information
                     is fully propagated throughout the Amazon CloudFront sys-
                     tem.

                 LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time the distribution was last modified.

                 DomainName -> (string)
                     The domain name corresponding to  the  distribution,  for
                     example, d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net .

                 S3Origin -> (structure)
                     A complex type that contains information about the Amazon
                     S3 bucket from which you  want  CloudFront  to  get  your
                     media files for distribution.

                     DomainName -> (string)
                        The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin.

                     OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                        The  CloudFront  origin  access  identity to associate
                        with the distribution. Use an origin  access  identity
                        to  configure  the  distribution so that end users can
                        only access objects in an  Amazon  S3  bucket  through
                        CloudFront.

                        If  you  want  end  users to be able to access objects
                        using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3  URL,
                        specify an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                        To  delete the origin access identity from an existing
                        distribution, update  the  distribution  configuration
                        and include an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                        To replace the origin access identity, update the dis-
                        tribution configuration and  specify  the  new  origin
                        access identity.

                 TrustedSigners -> (structure)
                     A complex type that specifies  the  Amazon  Web  Services
                     accounts, if any, that you want to allow to create signed
                     URLs for private content. If you want to  require  signed
                     URLs  in  requests  for objects in the target origin that
                     match the PathPattern for this  cache  behavior,  specify
                     true  for Enabled , and specify the applicable values for
                     Quantity and Items .If you don't want to  require  signed

                     specify false for Enabled and 0 for Quantity . Omit Items
                     .  To add, change, or remove one or more trusted signers,
                     change Enabled to true (if it's currently false ), change
                     Quantity  as  applicable,  and specify all of the trusted
                     signers that you want to include in the updated distribu-
                     tion.

                        This field is true if any of the Amazon  Web  Services
                        accounts  have  public keys that CloudFront can use to
                        verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed  cook-
                        ies. If not, this field is false .
