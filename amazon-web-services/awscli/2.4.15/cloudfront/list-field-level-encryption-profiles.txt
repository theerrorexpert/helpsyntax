NAME
       list-field-level-encryption-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Request  a  list of field-level encryption profiles that have been cre-
       ated in CloudFront for this account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-field-level-encryption-profiles
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in  your
          list  of  profiles.  The  results  include profiles in the list that
          occur after the marker. To get the next page  of  results,  set  the
          Marker  to  the  value  of  the  NextMarker  from the current page's
          response (which is also the ID of the last profile on that page).

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of field-level encryption profiles  you  want  in
          the response body.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list CloudFront field-level encryption profiles

       The following example gets a list of the CloudFront field-level encryp-
       tion profiles in your AWS account:

          aws cloudfront list-field-level-encryption-profiles

       Output:
