NAME
       update-origin-request-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an origin request policy configuration.

       When  you update an origin request policy configuration, all the fields
       are updated with the values provided in the request. You cannot  update
       some  fields  independent of others. To update an origin request policy
       configuration:

       o Use GetOriginRequestPolicyConfig to get the current configuration.

       o Locally modify the fields in the origin request policy  configuration
         that you want to update.

       o Call UpdateOriginRequestPolicy by providing the entire origin request
         policy configuration, including the  fields  that  you  modified  and
         those that you didnt.

       --id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  for  the origin request policy that you are
          updating. The identifier is returned in a cache behaviors  OriginRe-
          questPolicyId field in the response to GetDistributionConfig .

       --if-match (string)
          The  version of the origin request policy that you are updating. The
          version is returned in the origin request policys ETag field in  the
          response to GetOriginRequestPolicyConfig .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
