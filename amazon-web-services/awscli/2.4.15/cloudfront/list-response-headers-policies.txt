LIST-RESPONSE-HEADERS-POLICIES()              LIST-RESPONSE-HEADERS-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-response-headers-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of response headers policies.

       You can optionally apply a filter to get only the managed policies cre-
       ated by Amazon Web Services, or only the  custom  policies  created  in
       your Amazon Web Services account.

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

SYNOPSIS
            list-response-headers-policies
          [--type <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          A filter to get only the specified kind of  response  headers  poli-
          cies. Valid values are:

          o managed  Gets only the managed policies created by Amazon Web Ser-
            vices.

          o custom  Gets only the custom policies created in your  Amazon  Web
            Services account.

          Possible values:

          o managed

          o custom

       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list  of  response  headers  policies.  The  response  includes
          response  headers  policies in the list that occur after the marker.
          To get the next page of the list, set this fields value to the value
          of NextMarker from the current pages response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of response headers policies that you want to get
          in the response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResponseHeadersPolicyList -> (structure)
          A list of response headers policies.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If there are more items in the list than are in  this  response,
              this  element  is present. It contains the value that you should
              use in the Marker field of  a  subsequent  request  to  continue
              listing response headers policies where you left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The maximum number of response headers policies requested.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of response headers policies returned.

          Items -> (list)
              The response headers policies in the list.

              (structure)
                 Contains a response headers policy.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of response headers policy, either managed (cre-
                     ated by Amazon Web Services) or custom (created  in  this
                     Amazon Web Services account).

                 ResponseHeadersPolicy -> (structure)
                     The response headers policy.

                     Id -> (string)
                        The identifier for the response headers policy.

                     LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time when the response headers policy was
                        last modified.

                     ResponseHeadersPolicyConfig -> (structure)
                        A response headers policy configuration.

                        set  of HTTP response headers and their values. Cloud-
                        Front adds the headers in the policy to HTTP responses
                        that it sends for requests that match a cache behavior
                        thats associated with the policy.

                        Comment -> (string)
                            A comment to describe the response headers policy.

                            The  comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

                        Name -> (string)
                            A name to identify the response headers policy.
