          The request to create a new field-level encryption configuration.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A unique number that ensures the request can't be replayed.

              be longer than 128 characters.

          QueryArgProfileConfig -> (structure)
              A complex data type that specifies when to forward content if  a
              profile  isn't  found  and the profile that can be provided as a
              query argument in a request.

              ForwardWhenQueryArgProfileIsUnknown -> (boolean)
                 Flag to set if you want a request to be forwarded to the ori-
                 gin  even if the profile specified by the field-level encryp-
                 tion query argument, fle-profile, is unknown.

              QueryArgProfiles -> (structure)
                 Profiles specified for  query  argument-profile  mapping  for
                 field-level encryption.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     Number of profiles for query argument-profile mapping for
                     field-level encryption.

                            Query argument for  field-level  encryption  query
                            argument-profile mapping.

          ContentTypeProfileConfig -> (structure)
              A complex data type that specifies when to forward content if  a
              content  type isn't recognized and profiles to use as by default
              in a request if a query argument doesn't specify  a  profile  to
              use.

              ForwardWhenContentTypeIsUnknown -> (boolean)
                 The  setting in a field-level encryption content type-profile
                 mapping that specifies what to do  when  an  unknown  content
                 type  is  provided  for the profile. If true, content is for-
                 warded without being  encrypted  when  the  content  type  is
                 unknown.  If  false  (the default), an error is returned when

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a CloudFront field-level encryption configuration

       The following example creates a field-level encryption configuration by
       providing  the  configuration  parameters in a JSON file named fle-con-
       fig.json. Before you can create a field-level encryption configuration,
       you  must  have  a field-level encryption profile. To create a profile,
       see the create-field-level-encryption-profile command.

       For more information about CloudFront field-level encryption, see Using
       Field-Level  Encryption  to  Help  Protect Sensitive Data in the Amazon
       CloudFront Developer Guide.

              --field-level-encryption-config file://fle-config.json

       The file fle-config.json is a JSON document in the current folder  that
       contains the following:
