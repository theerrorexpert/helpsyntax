NAME
       list-cloud-front-origin-access-identities -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists origin access identities.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-cloud-front-origin-access-identities  is  a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data
       set  of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-pagi-
       nate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a
       paginated  response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the
       results of the following query expressions: CloudFrontOriginAccessIden-
       tityList.Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-cloud-front-origin-access-identities
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list CloudFront origin access identities

       The following example gets a list of the CloudFront origin access iden-
       tities (OAIs) in your AWS account:

          aws cloudfront list-cloud-front-origin-access-identities

       Output:

          {
              "CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList": {
                  "Items": [
                      {
                          "Id": "E74FTE3AEXAMPLE",
                          "S3CanonicalUserId": "cd13868f797c227fbea2830611a26fe0a21ba1b826ab4bed9b7771c9aEXAMPLE",
                          "Comment": "Example OAI"
                      },
                      {
                          "Id": "EH1HDMBEXAMPLE",
                          "S3CanonicalUserId": "1489f6f2e6faacaae7ff64c4c3e6956c24f78788abfc1718c3527c263bf7a17EXAMPLE",
                          "Comment": "Test OAI"
                      },
                      {
                          "Id": "E2X2C9TEXAMPLE",
                          "S3CanonicalUserId": "cbfeebb915a64749f9be546a45b3fcfd3a31c779673c13c4dd460911ae402c2EXAMPLE",
                          "Comment": "Example OAI #2"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList -> (structure)
          The CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList type.

          Marker -> (string)
              Use  this  when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
              your list of origin access identities. The results include iden-
              tities  in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next
              page of results, set the Marker to the value of  the  NextMarker
              from  the  current  page's response (which is also the ID of the
              last identity on that page).

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If IsTruncated is true , this element is  present  and  contains
              the  value  you can use for the Marker request parameter to con-
              tinue listing your origin access identities where they left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of origin access identities you want in the
              response body.

          IsTruncated -> (boolean)
              A flag that indicates  whether  more  origin  access  identities
              remain  to  be  listed.  If your results were truncated, you can
              make a follow-up pagination request  using  the  Marker  request
              parameter to retrieve more items in the list.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of CloudFront origin access identities that were cre-
              ated by the current Amazon Web Services account.

          Items -> (list)
              A complex type that contains one CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity-
              Summary element for each origin access identity that was created
              by the current Amazon Web Services account.

              (structure)
                 Summary of the information about a CloudFront  origin  access
                 identity.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  ID  for  the  origin  access  identity. For example:
                     E74FTE3AJFJ256A .

                 S3CanonicalUserId -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 canonical user ID  for  the  origin  access
                     identity,  which  you  use  when giving the origin access
                     identity read permission to an object in Amazon S3.

                 Comment -> (string)
                     The comment for this origin access  identity,  as  origi-
                     nally specified when created.
