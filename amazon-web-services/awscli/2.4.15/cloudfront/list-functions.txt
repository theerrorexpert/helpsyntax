LIST-FUNCTIONS()                                              LIST-FUNCTIONS()



NAME
       list-functions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list  of  all CloudFront functions in your Amazon Web Services
       account.

       You can optionally apply a filter to return only the functions that are
       in the specified stage, either DEVELOPMENT or LIVE .

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-functions
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--stage <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your  list of functions. The response includes functions in the list
          that occur after the marker. To get the next page of the  list,  set
          this  fields value to the value of NextMarker from the current pages
          response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of functions that you want in the response.

       --stage (string)
          An optional filter to return only the  functions  that  are  in  the
          specified stage, either DEVELOPMENT or LIVE .

          Possible values:

          o DEVELOPMENT

          o LIVE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FunctionList -> (structure)
          A list of CloudFront functions.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If  there  are more items in the list than are in this response,
              this element is present. It contains the value that  you  should
              use  in  the  Marker  field  of a subsequent request to continue
              listing functions where you left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The maximum number of functions requested.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of functions returned in the response.

          Items -> (list)
              Contains the functions in the list.

              (structure)
                 Contains  configuration  information  and  metadata  about  a
                 CloudFront function.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the CloudFront function.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the CloudFront function.

                 FunctionConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains  configuration  information  about  a CloudFront
                     function.

                     Comment -> (string)
                        A comment to describe the function.

                     Runtime -> (string)
                        The functions  runtime  environment.  The  only  valid
                        value is cloudfront-js-1.0 .

                 FunctionMetadata -> (structure)
                     Contains metadata about a CloudFront function.

                     FunctionARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the function. The
                        ARN uniquely identifies the function.

                     Stage -> (string)
                        The stage that the function is in, either  DEVELOPMENT
                        or LIVE .

                        When  a  function is in the DEVELOPMENT stage, you can
                        test the function with TestFunction ,  and  update  it
                        with UpdateFunction .

                        When  a  function is in the LIVE stage, you can attach
                        the function to a distributions cache behavior,  using
                        the functions ARN.

                     CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time when the function was created.

                     LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  date and time when the function was most recently
                        updated.
