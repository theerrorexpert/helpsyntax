NAME
       update-key-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a key group.

       When you update a key group, all the fields are updated with the values
       provided in the request. You cannot update some fields  independent  of
       others. To update a key group:

       o Get the current key group with GetKeyGroup or GetKeyGroupConfig .

       o Locally  modify  the fields in the key group that you want to update.
         For example, add or remove public key IDs.

       o Call UpdateKeyGroup with the entire key group object,  including  the
         fields that you modified and those that you didnt.

SYNOPSIS
            update-key-group
          --key-group-config <value>
          --id <value>
          [--if-match <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-group-config (structure)
          The key group configuration.

          Name -> (string)
              A name to identify the key group.

          Items -> (list)
              A list of the identifiers of the public keys in the key group.

              (string)

          Comment -> (string)
              A  comment  to  describe  the  key  group. The comment cannot be
              longer than 128 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Items=string,string,Comment=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "Items": ["string", ...],
            "Comment": "string"
          }

       --id (string)
          The identifier of the key group that you are updating.

       --if-match (string)
          The version of the key group that you are updating. The  version  is
          the key groups ETag value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
