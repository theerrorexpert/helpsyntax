       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-streaming-distribution
          --streaming-distribution-config <value>
          --id <value>
          [--if-match <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --streaming-distribution-config (structure)
          The streaming distribution's configuration information.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A  unique  value  (for  example, a date-time stamp) that ensures
              that the request can't be replayed.

              If the value of CallerReference is new (regardless of  the  con-
              tent of the StreamingDistributionConfig object), CloudFront cre-
              ates a new distribution.

              If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a  previ-
              ous  request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a Dis-
              tributionAlreadyExists error.

          S3Origin -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information  about  the  Amazon  S3
              bucket  from  which  you want CloudFront to get your media files
              for distribution.

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin.

              OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                 The CloudFront origin access identity to associate  with  the
                 distribution.  Use an origin access identity to configure the
                 distribution so that end users can only access objects in  an
                 Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                 If  you  want  end  users  to be able to access objects using
                 either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3  URL,  specify  an
                 empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                 To delete the origin access identity from an existing distri-
                 bution, update the distribution configuration and include  an
                 empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                 To  replace  the origin access identity, update the distribu-
                 tion configuration and specify the new  origin  access  iden-
                 tity.

                 For  more information, see Using an Origin Access Identity to
                 Restrict Access to Your  Amazon  S3  Content  in  the  Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

          Aliases -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate
              domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want  to  asso-
                 ciate with this distribution.

              Items -> (list)
                 A  complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that
                 you want to associate with this distribution.

                 (string)

          Comment -> (string)
              Any comments you want to include about the  streaming  distribu-
              tion.

          Logging -> (structure)
              A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for
              the streaming distribution.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs  to
                 an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when
                 you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable
                 logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify false
                 for Enabled , and specify empty Bucket and  Prefix  elements.
                 If  you  specify false for Enabled but you specify values for
                 Bucket and Prefix , the values are automatically deleted.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in,  for  exam-
                 ple, myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 An  optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the
                 access log filenames for  this  streaming  distribution,  for
                 example,  myprefix/  . If you want to enable logging, but you
                 don't want to specify a prefix, you  still  must  include  an
                 empty Prefix element in the Logging element.

          TrustedSigners -> (structure)
              A  complex  type that specifies any Amazon Web Services accounts
              that you want to permit to create signed URLs for  private  con-
              tent.  If  you want the distribution to use signed URLs, include
              this element; if you want the distribution to use  public  URLs,
              remove  this  element. For more information, see Serving Private
              Content through CloudFront in the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
              Guide .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 This field is true if any of the Amazon Web Services accounts
                 have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signa-
                 tures  of  signed URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field
                 is false .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers.

                 (string)

          PriceClass -> (string)
              A complex type that contains information about price  class  for
              this streaming distribution.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Whether  the  streaming  distribution  is enabled to accept user
              requests for content.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CallerReference": "string",
            "S3Origin": {
              "DomainName": "string",
              "OriginAccessIdentity": "string"
            },
            "Aliases": {

            "Enabled": true|false
          }

       --id (string)
          The streaming distribution's id.

       --if-match (string)
          The value of the ETag header that you received when  retrieving  the
          streaming  distribution's configuration. For example: E2QWRUHAPOMQZL
          .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StreamingDistribution -> (structure)
          The streaming distribution's information.

          Id -> (string)
              The  identifier  for  the  RTMP   distribution.   For   example:
              EGTXBD79EXAMPLE .

          ARN -> (string)
              The  ARN  (Amazon Resource Name) for the distribution. For exam-
              ple:         arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/EDFD-
              VBD632BHDS5  ,  where  123456789012  is your Amazon Web Services
              account ID.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the RTMP distribution. When the status  is
              Deployed  ,  the distribution's information is propagated to all
              CloudFront edge locations.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the distribution was last modified.

          DomainName -> (string)
              The domain name that corresponds to the streaming  distribution,
              for example, s5c39gqb8ow64r.cloudfront.net .

          ActiveTrustedSigners -> (structure)
              A  complex  type that lists the Amazon Web Services accounts, if
              any, that you included in the TrustedSigners  complex  type  for
              this distribution. These are the accounts that you want to allow
              to create signed URLs for private content.

              The Signer complex type lists the Amazon  Web  Services  account
              number of the trusted signer or self if the signer is the Amazon
              Web Services account that created the distribution.  The  Signer
              element also includes the IDs of any active CloudFront key pairs
              that are associated with the trusted signer's  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices  account.  If  no KeyPairId element appears for a Signer ,
              that signer can't create signed URLs.

              For more information, see Serving Private Content through Cloud-
              Front in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 This field is true if any of the Amazon Web Services accounts
                 in the list have active CloudFront key pairs that  CloudFront
                 can  use  to  verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed
                 cookies. If not, this field is false .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of Amazon Web Services accounts and the identifiers of
                 active  CloudFront  key pairs in each account that CloudFront
                 can use to verify the signatures of signed  URLs  and  signed
                 cookies.

                 (structure)
                     A  list  of  Amazon  Web Services accounts and the active
                     CloudFront key pairs in each account that CloudFront  can
                     use  to  verify  the signatures of signed URLs and signed
                     cookies.

                        active CloudFront key pairs that CloudFront can use to
                        verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed  cook-
                        ies.  If the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
                        key pairs is the same account that owns the CloudFront
                        distribution, the value of this field is self .

                     KeyPairIds -> (structure)
                        A list of CloudFront key pair identifiers.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of key pair identifiers in the list.

                        Items -> (list)

                            (string)

          StreamingDistributionConfig -> (structure)
              The current configuration information for the RTMP distribution.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that  ensures
                 that the request can't be replayed.

                 If  the  value  of  CallerReference is new (regardless of the
                 content of the  StreamingDistributionConfig  object),  Cloud-
                 Front creates a new distribution.

                 If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a pre-
                 vious request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns  a
                 DistributionAlreadyExists error.

              S3Origin -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that contains information about the Amazon S3
                 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files
                 for distribution.

                 DomainName -> (string)
                     The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin.

                 OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                     The  CloudFront  origin access identity to associate with
                     the distribution. Use an origin access identity  to  con-
                     figure the distribution so that end users can only access
                     objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                     If you want end users to be able to access objects  using
                     either  the  CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify
                     an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To delete the origin access  identity  from  an  existing
                     distribution,  update  the distribution configuration and
                     include an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To replace the origin access identity, update the distri-
                     bution  configuration  and  specify the new origin access
                     identity.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to as-
                     sociate with this distribution.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A  complex  type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any,

                 for the streaming distribution.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs
                     to  an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable log-
                     ging when you create a streaming distribution or  if  you
                     want to disable logging for an existing streaming distri-
                     bution, specify false for Enabled  ,  and  specify  empty
                     Bucket  and  Prefix  elements.  If  you specify false for
                     Enabled but you specify values for Bucket  and  Prefix  ,
                     the values are automatically deleted.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3  bucket  to store the access logs in, for

                     but  you  don't  want to specify a prefix, you still must
                     include an empty Prefix element in the Logging element.

              TrustedSigners -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type  that  specifies  any  Amazon  Web  Services
                 accounts  that  you  want to permit to create signed URLs for
                 private content. If you want the distribution to  use  signed
                 URLs,  include  this element; if you want the distribution to
                 use public URLs, remove this element. For  more  information,
