LIST-CACHE-POLICIES()                                    LIST-CACHE-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-cache-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of cache policies.

       You  can  optionally apply a filter to return only the managed policies
       created by Amazon Web Services, or only the custom policies created  in
       your Amazon Web Services account.

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-cache-policies
          [--type <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          A filter to return only the specified kinds of cache policies. Valid
          values are:

          o managed   Returns  only the managed policies created by Amazon Web
            Services.

          o custom  Returns only the custom policies created  in  your  Amazon
            Web Services account.

          Possible values:

          o managed

          o custom

       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of cache policies. The response includes cache policies in
          the  list  that  occur after the marker. To get the next page of the
          list, set this fields value to the value of NextMarker from the cur-
          rent pages response.

       --max-items (string)
          The  maximum number of cache policies that you want in the response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CachePolicyList -> (structure)
          A list of cache policies.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If there are more items in the list than are in  this  response,
              this  element  is present. It contains the value that you should
              use in the Marker field of  a  subsequent  request  to  continue
              listing cache policies where you left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The maximum number of cache policies requested.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The total number of cache policies returned in the response.

          Items -> (list)
              Contains the cache policies in the list.

              (structure)
                 Contains a cache policy.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of cache policy, either managed (created by Ama-
                     zon Web Services) or custom (created in this  Amazon  Web
                     Services account).

                 CachePolicy -> (structure)
                     The cache policy.

                     Id -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the cache policy.

                     LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time when the cache policy was last modi-
                        fied.

                     CachePolicyConfig -> (structure)
                        The cache policy configuration.

                        Comment -> (string)
                            A comment to describe the cache policy.  The  com-
                            ment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

                        Name -> (string)
                            A unique name to identify the cache policy.

                        DefaultTTL -> (long)
                            The  default  amount of time, in seconds, that you
                            want objects  to  stay  in  the  CloudFront  cache
                            before  CloudFront  sends  another  request to the
                            origin to see if  the  object  has  been  updated.
                            CloudFront  uses this value as the objects time to
                            live (TTL) only when  the  origin  does  not  send
                            Cache-Control  or Expires headers with the object.

                            tent  Stays  in  an Edge Cache (Expiration) in the
                            Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            The default value for this field is 86400  seconds
                            (one  day).  If  the  value of MinTTL is more than
                            86400 seconds, then the  default  value  for  this
                            field is the same as the value of MinTTL .

                        MaxTTL -> (long)
                            The  maximum  amount  of  time,  in  seconds, that
                            objects stay in the CloudFront cache before Cloud-
                            Front  sends  another request to the origin to see
                            if the object has been  updated.  CloudFront  uses
                            this  value  only when the origin sends Cache-Con-
                            trol or Expires headers with the object. For  more
                            information,  see  Managing How Long Content Stays
                            in an Edge Cache (Expiration) in the Amazon Cloud-
                            Front Developer Guide .

                            The  default value for this field is 31536000 sec-
                            onds  (one  year).  If  the  value  of  MinTTL  or
                            DefaultTTL is more than 31536000 seconds, then the
                            default value for this field is the  same  as  the
                            value of DefaultTTL .

                        MinTTL -> (long)
                            The  minimum  amount of time, in seconds, that you
                            want objects  to  stay  in  the  CloudFront  cache
                            before  CloudFront  sends  another  request to the
                            origin to see if the object has been updated.  For
                            more  information,  see  Managing How Long Content

                        ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin   ->  (struc-
                        ture)
                            The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL  query  strings
                            to  include  in the cache key. The values included
                            in the cache key  are  automatically  included  in
                            requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                            EnableAcceptEncodingGzip -> (boolean)
                               A    flag   that   can   affect   whether   the
                               Accept-Encoding HTTP header is included in  the
                               cache  key and included in requests that Cloud-
                               Front sends to the origin.

                               This field is related to the EnableAcceptEncod-
                               ingBrotli field. If one or both of these fields
                               is true  and the viewer  request  includes  the
                               Accept-Encoding  header,  then  CloudFront does
                               the following:

                               o Normalizes   the   value   of   the   viewers
                                 Accept-Encoding header

                               o Includes  the  normalized header in the cache
                                 key

                               o Includes the normalized header in the request
                                 to the origin, if a request is necessary

                               For  more  information, see Compression support
                               in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                               If you set this value to true , and this  cache
                               behavior  also  has  an  origin  request policy
                               attached, do not  include  the  Accept-Encoding
                               header in the origin request policy. CloudFront
                               always includes the Accept-Encoding  header  in
                               origin requests when the value of this field is
                               true , so including this header  in  an  origin
                               request policy has no effect.

                               If both of these fields are false , then Cloud-
                               Front treats  the  Accept-Encoding  header  the
                               same  as  any  other  HTTP header in the viewer
                               request. By default, its not  included  in  the
                               cache  key  and  its  not  included  in  origin
                               requests. In this case, you  can  manually  add
                               Accept-Encoding  to  the headers whitelist like
                               any other HTTP header.

                            EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli -> (boolean)
                               A   flag   that   can   affect   whether    the
                               Accept-Encoding  HTTP header is included in the
                               cache key and included in requests that  Cloud-
                               Front sends to the origin.

                               ingGzip field. If one or both of  these  fields
                               is  true   and  the viewer request includes the
                               Accept-Encoding header,  then  CloudFront  does
                               the following:

                               o Includes the normalized header in  the  cache
                                 key

                               o Includes the normalized header in the request

                               If  you set this value to true , and this cache
                               behavior also  has  an  origin  request  policy

                            HeadersConfig -> (structure)
                               An  object  that  determines  whether  any HTTP
                               headers (and if so, which headers) are included
                               in  the cache key and automatically included in

                                   Quantity -> (integer)
                                      The  number of header names in the Items
                                      list.
