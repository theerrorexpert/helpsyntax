GET-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()                            GET-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       get-realtime-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a real-time log configuration.

       To  get  a  real-time log configuration, you can provide the configura-
       tions name or its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must provide at least
       one.  If  you  provide  both,  CloudFront uses the name to identify the
       real-time log configuration to get.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-realtime-log-config
          [--name <value>]
          [--arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the real-time log configuration to get.

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log configuration to
          get.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RealtimeLogConfig -> (structure)
          A real-time log configuration.

          ARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this real-time log configura-
              tion.

          Name -> (string)
              The unique name of this real-time log configuration.

          SamplingRate -> (long)
              The sampling rate for this real-time log configuration. The sam-
              pling rate determines the percentage of viewer requests that are
              represented in the real-time log data. The sampling rate  is  an
              integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

          EndPoints -> (list)
              Contains  information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream where
              you are sending real-time log data for this real-time  log  con-
              figuration.

              (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  the  Amazon Kinesis data stream
                 where you are sending real-time log data in a  real-time  log
                 configuration.

                 StreamType -> (string)
                     The  type  of data stream where you are sending real-time
                     log data. The only valid value is Kinesis .

                 KinesisStreamConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream
                     where you are sending real-time log data.

                     RoleARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of an Identity and
                        Access Management (IAM) role that CloudFront  can  use
                        to  send  real-time  log  data  to  your  Kinesis data
                        stream.

                        For more information the IAM role, see  Real-time  log
                        configuration IAM role in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
                        oper Guide .

                     StreamARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  Kinesis  data
                        stream where you are sending real-time log data.

          Fields -> (list)
              A list of fields that are included in each real-time log record.
              In an API response, the fields are provided in the same order in
              which they are sent to the Amazon Kinesis data stream.

              For  more information about fields, see Real-time log configura-
              tion fields in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              (string)
