NAME
       update-response-headers-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a response headers policy.

       When  you  update  a  response  headers  policy,  the  entire policy is
       replaced. You cannot update some policy fields independent  of  others.
       To update a response headers policy configuration:

       o Use GetResponseHeadersPolicyConfig to get the current policys config-
         uration.

       o Modify the fields in the response headers policy  configuration  that
         you want to update.

       o Call  UpdateResponseHeadersPolicy  ,  providing  the  entire response
         headers policy configuration, including the fields that you  modified
         and those that you didnt.

       --id (string)
          The  identifier  for the response headers policy that you are updat-
          ing.

       --if-match (string)
          The version of the response headers policy that you are updating.

          The version is returned in the  cache  policys  ETag  field  in  the
          response to GetResponseHeadersPolicyConfig .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        An HTTP response header name and its value. CloudFront
                        includes  this  header in HTTP responses that it sends
                        for requests that match a cache behavior thats associ-
                        ated with this response headers policy.

                        Header -> (string)
                            The HTTP response header name.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the HTTP response header.

                        Override -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean that determines whether CloudFront over-
                            rides  a  response  header  with  the  same   name
                            received from the origin with the header specified
                            here.

       ETag -> (string)
          The current version of the response headers policy.
