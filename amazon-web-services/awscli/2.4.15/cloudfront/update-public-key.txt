OPTIONS
       --public-key-config (structure)
          A public key configuration.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A string included in the request to  help  make  sure  that  the
              request cant be replayed.

          Name -> (string)
              A name to help identify the public key.

          EncodedKey -> (string)
              The  public  key  that  you  can use with signed URLs and signed
              cookies , or with field-level encryption .

          Comment -> (string)
              A comment to describe the public  key.  The  comment  cannot  be
              longer than 128 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CallerReference=string,Name=string,EncodedKey=string,Comment=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CallerReference": "string",
            "Name": "string",
            "EncodedKey": "string",
            "Comment": "string"
          }

       --id (string)
          The identifier of the public key that you are updating.

       --if-match (string)
          The  value  of the ETag header that you received when retrieving the
          public key to update. For example: E2QWRUHAPOMQZL .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
