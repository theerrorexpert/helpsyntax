UPDATE-DISTRIBUTION()                                    UPDATE-DISTRIBUTION()



NAME
       update-distribution -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the configuration for a web distribution.

       WARNING:
          When  you update a distribution, there are more required fields than
          when you create a distribution. When you update your distribution by
          using this API action, follow the steps here to get the current con-
          figuration and then make your updates, to make sure that you include
          all  of  the required fields. To view a summary, see Required Fields
          for Create Distribution and Update Distribution in the Amazon Cloud-
          Front Developer Guide .

       The update process includes getting the current distribution configura-
       tion, updating the XML document that is returned to make your  changes,
       and  then submitting an UpdateDistribution request to make the updates.

       For information about updating a distribution using the CloudFront con-
       sole  instead,  see  Creating  a  Distribution in the Amazon CloudFront
       Developer Guide .
          To update a web distribution using the CloudFront API

       o Submit a GetDistributionConfig request to get the current  configura-
         tion and an Etag header for the distribution.

       NOTE:
          If  you  update  the  distribution  again,  you  must get a new Etag
          header.

       o Update the XML document that was returned in  the  response  to  your
         GetDistributionConfig request to include your changes.

       WARNING:
          When you edit the XML file, be aware of the following:

              o You must strip out the ETag parameter that is returned.

              o Additional fields are required when you update a distribution.
                There may be fields included in the XML file for features that
                you haven't configured for your distribution. This is expected
                and required to successfully update the distribution.

              o You can't change the value of CallerReference . If you try  to
                change  this value, CloudFront returns an IllegalUpdate error.

              o The new configuration replaces the existing configuration; the
                values  that  you specify in an UpdateDistribution request are
                not merged into your existing  configuration.  When  you  add,
                delete,  or  replace values in an element that allows multiple
                values (for example, CNAME ), you must specify all of the val-
                ues  that  you  want to appear in the updated distribution. In
                addition, you must update the corresponding Quantity  element.

       o Submit  an UpdateDistribution request to update the configuration for
         your distribution:

         o In the request body, include the XML document that you  updated  in
           Step  2.  The request body must include an XML document with a Dis-
           tributionConfig element.

         o Set the value of the HTTP If-Match header to the value of the  ETag
           header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the GetDistribu-
           tionConfig request in Step 1.

       o Review the response to the UpdateDistribution request to confirm that
         the configuration was successfully updated.

       o Optional:  Submit  a  GetDistribution  request  to  confirm that your
         changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the  value  of
         Status is Deployed .

SYNOPSIS
            update-distribution
          [--distribution-config <value>]
          --id <value>
          [--if-match <value>]
          [--default-root-object <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --distribution-config (structure)
          The distribution's configuration information.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A  unique  value  (for  example, a date-time stamp) that ensures
              that the request can't be replayed.

              If the value of CallerReference is new (regardless of  the  con-
              tent of the DistributionConfig object), CloudFront creates a new
              distribution.

              If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a  previ-
              ous  request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a Dis-
              tributionAlreadyExists error.

          Aliases -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate
              domain names), if any, for this distribution.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The  number  of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to asso-
                 ciate with this distribution.

              Items -> (list)
                 A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any,  that
                 you want to associate with this distribution.

                 (string)

          DefaultRootObject -> (string)
              The  object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin
              (for example, index.html ) when a viewer requests the  root  URL
              for  your  distribution  (http://www.example.com ) instead of an
              object  in   your   distribution   (http://www.example.com/prod-
              uct-description.html  ). Specifying a default root object avoids
              exposing the contents of your distribution.

              Specify only the object name, for example,  index.html  .  Don't
              add a / before the object name.

              If you don't want to specify a default root object when you cre-
              ate a distribution, include an empty DefaultRootObject  element.

              To delete the default root object from an existing distribution,
              update the  distribution  configuration  and  include  an  empty
              DefaultRootObject element.

              To replace the default root object, update the distribution con-
              figuration and specify the new object.

              For more information about the default root object, see Creating
              a Default Root Object in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          Origins -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about origins for  this
              distribution.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of origins for this distribution.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of origins.

                 (structure)
                     An origin.

                     An  origin  is  the location where content is stored, and
                     from which CloudFront gets content to serve  to  viewers.
                     To specify an origin:

                     o Use  S3OriginConfig to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that
                       is not configured with static website hosting.

                     o Use CustomOriginConfig to specify all  other  kinds  of
                       origins, including:

                       o An  Amazon  S3  bucket that is configured with static
                         website hosting

                       o An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer

                       o An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint

                       o An AWS Elemental MediaStore container

                       o Any other HTTP  server,  running  on  an  Amazon  EC2
                         instance or any other kind of host

                     For  the  current  maximum number of origins that you can
                     specify per distribution, see General Quotas on Web  Dis-
                     tributions in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide (quo-
                     tas were formerly referred to as limits).

                     Id -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be
                        unique within the distribution.

                        Use  this  value  to  specify  the TargetOriginId in a
                        CacheBehavior or DefaultCacheBehavior .

                     DomainName -> (string)
                        The domain name for the origin.

                        For more information, see Origin Domain  Name  in  the
                        Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     OriginPath -> (string)
                        An optional path that CloudFront appends to the origin
                        domain name when CloudFront requests content from  the
                        origin.

                        For  more  information,  see Origin Path in the Amazon
                        CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     CustomHeaders -> (structure)
                        A list of HTTP header names and values that CloudFront
                        adds to the requests that it sends to the origin.

                        For  more  information,  see  Adding Custom Headers to
                        Origin Requests in  the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
                        Guide .

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  custom  headers, if any, for this
                            distribution.

                        Items -> (list)
                               Optional : A list that contains one  OriginCus-
                               tomHeader  element  for each custom header that
                               you want CloudFront to forward to  the  origin.
                               If Quantity is 0 , omit Items .

                            (structure)
                               A  complex  type  that  contains HeaderName and
                               HeaderValue elements, if any, for this  distri-
                               bution.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The  name  of a header that you want Cloud-
                                   Front to send  to  your  origin.  For  more
                                   information,  see  Adding Custom Headers to
                                   Origin Requests in  the  Amazon  CloudFront
                                   Developer Guide .

                               HeaderValue -> (string)
                                   The value for the header that you specified
                                   in the HeaderName field.

                     S3OriginConfig -> (structure)
                        Use this type to specify an origin that is  an  Amazon
                        S3  bucket  that is not configured with static website
                        hosting. To specify any other type of origin,  includ-
                        ing an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static
                        website  hosting,  use  the  CustomOriginConfig   type
                        instead.

                        OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                            The CloudFront origin access identity to associate
                            with the origin. Use an origin access identity  to
                            configure  the  origin  so  that  viewers can only
                            access objects in  an  Amazon  S3  bucket  through
                            CloudFront. The format of the value is:

                            origin-access-identity/cloudfront/ID-of-ori-
                            gin-access-identity

                            where `` ID-of-origin-access-identity  ``  is  the
                            value  that  CloudFront returned in the ID element
                            when you created the origin access identity.

                            If you want viewers to be able to  access  objects
                            using  either  the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3
                            URL, specify an  empty  OriginAccessIdentity  ele-
                            ment.

                            To  delete  the  origin  access  identity  from an
                            existing  distribution,  update  the  distribution
                            configuration  and include an empty OriginAccessI-
                            dentity element.

                            To replace the origin access identity, update  the
                            distribution  configuration  and  specify  the new
                            origin access identity.

                            For more information about the origin access iden-
                            tity,  see  Serving Private Content through Cloud-
                            Front in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     CustomOriginConfig -> (structure)
                        Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Ama-
                        zon  S3  bucket,  with one exception. If the Amazon S3
                        bucket is configured with static website hosting,  use
                        this  type.  If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured
                        with static website hosting,  use  the  S3OriginConfig
                        type instead.

                        HTTPPort -> (integer)
                            The  HTTP  port that CloudFront uses to connect to
                            the origin. Specify the HTTP port that the  origin
                            listens on.

                        HTTPSPort -> (integer)
                            The  HTTPS port that CloudFront uses to connect to
                            the origin. Specify the HTTPS port that the origin
                            listens on.

                        OriginProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                            Specifies the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that Cloud-
                            Front uses to connect to the origin. Valid  values
                            are:

                            o http-only   CloudFront  always uses HTTP to con-
                              nect to the origin.

                            o match-viewer  CloudFront connects to the  origin
                              using  the same protocol that the viewer used to
                              connect to CloudFront.

                            o https-only  CloudFront always uses HTTPS to con-
                              nect to the origin.

                        OriginSslProtocols -> (structure)
                            Specifies the minimum SSL/TLS protocol that Cloud-
                            Front uses when connecting  to  your  origin  over
                            HTTPS.  Valid  values  include  SSLv3  ,  TLSv1  ,
                            TLSv1.1 , and TLSv1.2 .

                            For more information, see Minimum Origin SSL  Pro-
                            tocol in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The  number  of SSL/TLS protocols that you want
                               to allow CloudFront to use when establishing an
                               HTTPS connection with this origin.

                            Items -> (list)
                               A  list that contains allowed SSL/TLS protocols
                               for this distribution.

                               (string)

                        OriginReadTimeout -> (integer)
                            Specifies how long, in seconds,  CloudFront  waits
                            for a response from the origin. This is also known
                            as the origin response timeout . The minimum time-
                            out  is  1  second, the maximum is 60 seconds, and
                            the default (if you dont specify otherwise) is  30
                            seconds.

                            For  more information, see Origin Response Timeout
                            in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        OriginKeepaliveTimeout -> (integer)
                            Specifies how long, in  seconds,  CloudFront  per-
                            sists  its  connection  to the origin. The minimum
                            timeout is 1 second, the maximum  is  60  seconds,
                            and the default (if you dont specify otherwise) is
                            5 seconds.

                            For more information, see Origin Keep-alive  Time-
                            out in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     ConnectionAttempts -> (integer)
                        The  number  of times that CloudFront attempts to con-
                        nect to the origin. The minimum number is 1, the maxi-
                        mum  is 3, and the default (if you dont specify other-
                        wise) is 3.

                        For a custom origin (including  an  Amazon  S3  bucket
                        thats  configured  with  static website hosting), this
                        value also specifies the number of times  that  Cloud-
                        Front  attempts  to get a response from the origin, in
                        the case of an Origin Response Timeout .

                        For more information, see Origin  Connection  Attempts
                        in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     ConnectionTimeout -> (integer)
                        The  number of seconds that CloudFront waits when try-
                        ing to establish a connection to the origin. The mini-
                        mum  timeout  is  1 second, the maximum is 10 seconds,
                        and the default (if you dont specify otherwise) is  10
                        seconds.

                        For more information, see Origin Connection Timeout in
                        the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     OriginShield -> (structure)
                        CloudFront Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield can help
                        reduce the load on your origin.

                        For  more  information, see Using Origin Shield in the
                        Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            A flag that specifies  whether  Origin  Shield  is
                            enabled.

                            When  its  enabled, CloudFront routes all requests
                            through Origin Shield, which can help protect your
                            origin.  When  its disabled, CloudFront might send
                            requests directly to  your  origin  from  multiple
                            edge locations or regional edge caches.

                        OriginShieldRegion -> (string)
                            The  Amazon Web Services Region for Origin Shield.

                            Specify the Amazon Web Services  Region  that  has
                            the  lowest  latency  to your origin. To specify a
                            region, use the region code, not the region  name.
                            For  example, specify the US East (Ohio) region as
                            us-east-2 .

                            When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must
                            specify  the Amazon Web Services Region for Origin
                            Shield.  For  the  list  of  Amazon  Web  Services
                            Regions  that you can specify, and for help choos-
                            ing the best Region for your origin, see  Choosing
                            the  Amazon  Web Services Region for Origin Shield
                            in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          OriginGroups -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about origin groups for
              this distribution.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of origin groups.

              Items -> (list)
                 The items (origin groups) in a distribution.

                 (structure)
                     An  origin  group  includes two origins (a primary origin
                     and a second origin to failover to) and a failover crite-
                     ria  that you specify. You create an origin group to sup-
                     port origin failover in CloudFront. When  you  create  or
                     update  a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group
                     instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will  failover
                     from  the  primary  origin to the second origin under the
                     failover conditions that you've chosen.

                     Id -> (string)
                        The origin group's ID.

                        failover criteria for an origin group.

                        StatusCodes -> (structure)
                            The status codes that, when returned from the pri-
                            mary origin, will trigger CloudFront  to  failover
                            to the second origin.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of status codes.

                            Items -> (list)
                               The items (status codes) for an origin group.

                               (integer)

                     Members -> (structure)
                        A  complex  type  that  contains information about the
                        origins in an origin group.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of origins in an origin group.

                        Items -> (list)
                            Items (origins) in an origin group.

                            (structure)
                               An origin in an origin group.

                               OriginId -> (string)
                                   The ID for an origin in an origin group.

          DefaultCacheBehavior -> (structure)
              A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if  you
              don't  specify  a  CacheBehavior element or if files don't match
              any of the values of PathPattern in CacheBehavior elements.  You
              must create exactly one default cache behavior.

              TargetOriginId -> (string)
                 The  value  of  ID for the origin that you want CloudFront to
                 route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

              TrustedSigners -> (structure)

                 WARNING:
                     We recommend using TrustedKeyGroups instead  of  Trusted-
                     Signers .

                 A  list  of Amazon Web Services account IDs whose public keys
                 CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 When  a  cache  behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront
                 requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests  that
                 match  the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed
                 with the private key of a CloudFront key pair  in  a  trusted
                 signers Amazon Web Services account. The signed URL or cookie
                 contains information about which public key CloudFront should
                 use  to  verify  the  signature.  For  more  information, see
                 Serving private content in the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
                 Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     This  field  is  true  if  any of the Amazon Web Services
                     accounts have public keys that CloudFront can use to ver-
                     ify  the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If
                     not, this field is false .

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers.

                     (string)

              TrustedKeyGroups -> (structure)
                 A list of key groups that  CloudFront  can  use  to  validate
                 signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront
                 requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests  that
                 match  the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed
                 with a private key whose corresponding public key is  in  the
                 key  group.  The  signed  URL  or cookie contains information
                 about which public key CloudFront should use  to  verify  the
                 signature.  For more information, see Serving private content
                 in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     This field is true if any of the key groups in  the  list
                     have  public  keys  that CloudFront can use to verify the
                     signatures of signed URLs and  signed  cookies.  If  not,
                     this field is false .

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of key groups in the list.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A list of key groups identifiers.

                     (string)

              ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                 The  protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the
                 origin specified by TargetOriginId when a request matches the
                 path  pattern  in PathPattern . You can specify the following
                 options:

                 o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                 o redirect-to-https : If a viewer submits  an  HTTP  request,
                   CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Perma-
                   nently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The  viewer
                   then resubmits the request using the new URL.

                 o https-only  : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront
                   returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).

                 For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol,  see
                 Requiring  HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront in the Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object
                     that  was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to
                     use any other protocol to fetch the object. If  you  have
                     recently  changed  from  HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that
                     you clear your objects cache because cached  objects  are
                     protocol  agnostic. That means that an edge location will
                     return an object from the cache regardless of whether the
                     current request protocol matches the protocol used previ-
                     ously. For more information, see Managing  Cache  Expira-
                     tion in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type  that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront
                 processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your  cus-
                 tom origin. There are three choices:

                 o CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.

                 o CloudFront forwards only GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS requests.

                 o CloudFront forwards GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST  ,
                   and DELETE requests.

                 If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access
                 to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom  origin  so  users
                 can't  perform  operations  that  you don't want them to. For
                 example, you might not want  users  to  have  permissions  to
                 delete objects from your origin.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to
                     forward to your origin. Valid values are 2 (for  GET  and
                     HEAD requests), 3 (for GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS requests)
                     and 7 (for GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT,  PATCH,  POST  ,  and
                     DELETE requests).

                 Items -> (list)
                     A  complex  type  that contains the HTTP methods that you
                     want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                     (string)

                 CachedMethods -> (structure)
                     A complex type that controls  whether  CloudFront  caches
                     the  response  to requests using the specified HTTP meth-
                     ods. There are two choices:

                     o CloudFront caches responses to GET and HEAD requests.

                     o CloudFront caches responses to GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS
                       requests.

                     If  you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin,
                     you may need  to  forward  Access-Control-Request-Method,
                     Access-Control-Request-Headers,  and  Origin  headers for
                     the responses to be cached correctly.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of HTTP methods for which you  want  Cloud-
                        Front  to  cache  responses.  Valid  values are 2 (for
                        caching responses to GET and HEAD requests) and 3 (for
                        caching   responses  to  GET  ,  HEAD  ,  and  OPTIONS
                        requests).

                     Items -> (list)
                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you
                        want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                        (string)

              SmoothStreaming -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  you want to distribute media files in the
                 Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the  origin  that  is
                 associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify true ; if
                 not, specify false . If you specify true for  SmoothStreaming
                 ,  you  can  still  distribute other content using this cache
                 behavior if the content matches the value of PathPattern .

              Compress -> (boolean)
                 Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain
                 files  for this cache behavior. If so, specify true ; if not,
                 specify false . For more information, see Serving  Compressed
                 Files in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              LambdaFunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge func-
                 tion associations for a cache behavior.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of Lambda@Edge function associations for  this
                     cache behavior.

                 Items -> (list)
                        Optional  :  A  complex type that contains LambdaFunc-
                        tionAssociation items  for  this  cache  behavior.  If
                        Quantity is 0 , you can omit Items .

                     (structure)
                        A  complex  type  that contains a Lambda@Edge function
                        association.

                        LambdaFunctionARN -> (string)
                            The ARN of  the  Lambda@Edge  function.  You  must
                            specify  the  ARN of a function version; you can't
                            specify an alias or $LATEST.

                        EventType -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  event   type   that   triggers   a
                            Lambda@Edge  function  invocation. You can specify
                            the following values:

                            o viewer-request  :  The  function  executes  when
                              CloudFront  receives a request from a viewer and
                              before it checks to see  whether  the  requested
                              object is in the edge cache.

                            o origin-request : The function executes only when
                              CloudFront sends a request to your origin.  When
                              the  requested  object is in the edge cache, the
                              function doesn't execute.

                            o origin-response : The  function  executes  after
                              CloudFront  receives  a response from the origin
                              and before it caches the object in the response.
                              When  the requested object is in the edge cache,
                              the function doesn't execute.

                            o viewer-response : The function  executes  before
                              CloudFront  returns  the requested object to the
                              viewer.  The  function  executes  regardless  of
                              whether  the  object  was  already  in  the edge
                              cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code
                              other  than  HTTP 200 (OK), the function doesn't
                              execute.

                        IncludeBody -> (boolean)
                            A flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to  have

                 A DefaultCacheBehavior must include either a CachePolicyId or
                 ForwardedValues . We recommend that you use a CachePolicyId .

              OriginRequestPolicyId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  of the origin request policy that is
                 attached to the default cache behavior. For more information,

              ForwardedValues -> (structure)
                 This  field  is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache
                 policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For
                 more  information,  see  Working  with policies in the Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 If you want to include values in the cache key, use  a  cache

                 If you want to send values to the origin but not include them
                 in the cache key, use an  origin  request  policy.  For  more

                 A  complex  type  that specifies how CloudFront handles query
                 strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                 QueryString -> (boolean)
                     This field is deprecated. We recommend  that  you  use  a
                     cache  policy or an origin request policy instead of this
                     field.

                     If you want to include query strings in  the  cache  key,
                     use  a  cache  policy. For more information, see Creating
                     cache policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     If  you  want to send query strings to the origin but not
                     include them in the cache key, use an origin request pol-
                     icy.  For  more  information, see Creating origin request
                     policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     Indicates whether you want CloudFront  to  forward  query
                     strings  to the origin that is associated with this cache
                     behavior and cache based on the query string  parameters.
                     CloudFront  behavior  depends on the value of QueryString
                     and on the  values  that  you  specify  for  QueryString-
                     CacheKeys , if any:

                     If you specify true for QueryString and you don't specify
                     any values for QueryStringCacheKeys , CloudFront forwards
                     all  query  string  parameters  to  the origin and caches
                     based on all query string parameters.  Depending  on  how
                     many  query  string  parameters and values you have, this
                     can adversely affect performance because CloudFront  must
                     forward more requests to the origin.

                     If  you  specify true for QueryString and you specify one
                     or more values for QueryStringCacheKeys , CloudFront for-
                     wards  all  query string parameters to the origin, but it
                     only caches based on the query string parameters that you
                     specify.

                     If you specify false for QueryString , CloudFront doesn't
                     forward any query string parameters to  the  origin,  and
                     doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                 Cookies -> (structure)
                     This  field  is  deprecated.  We recommend that you use a
                     cache policy or an origin request policy instead of  this
                     field.

                     If  you  want  to include cookies in the cache key, use a
                     cache policy. For more information,  see  Creating  cache
                     policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include
                     them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.  For
                     more information, see Creating origin request policies in
                     the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     A complex type that specifies whether you want CloudFront
                     to  forward cookies to the origin and, if so, which ones.

                     Forward -> (string)
                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use  a
                        cache  policy  or  an origin request policy instead of
                        this field.

                        If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a

                        policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        If you want to send cookies  to  the  origin  but  not
                        include them in the cache key, use origin request pol-
                        icy. For more information, see Creating origin request
                        policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        Specifies  which  cookies to forward to the origin for
                        this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies
                        specified in the WhitelistedNames complex type.

                        Amazon  S3  doesn't  process  cookies.  When the cache
                        behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon  S3  ori-
                        gin, specify none for the Forward element.

                     WhitelistedNames -> (structure)
                        This  field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a
                        cache policy or an origin request  policy  instead  of
                        this field.

                        If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a
                        cache policy. For more information, see Creating cache
                        policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        If  you  want  to  send  cookies to the origin but not
                        include them in the cache key, use an  origin  request
                        policy.  For  more  information,  see  Creating origin
                        request policies in the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
                        Guide .

                        Required  if  you  specify  whitelist for the value of
                        Forward . A complex type that specifies how many  dif-
                        ferent  cookies  you want CloudFront to forward to the
                        origin for this cache behavior and,  if  you  want  to
                        forward  selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                        If you specify all or none for the value of Forward  ,
                        omit  WhitelistedNames  .  If  you change the value of
                        Forward from whitelist to all or none  and  you  don't
                        delete the WhitelistedNames element and its child ele-
                        ments, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                        For the current limit on the number  of  cookie  names

                 Headers -> (structure)
                     This  field  is  deprecated.  We recommend that you use a
                     cache policy or an origin request policy instead of  this
                     field.

                     If  you  want  to include headers in the cache key, use a

              MinTTL -> (long)
                 This  field  is  deprecated.  We  recommend  that you use the

                 The  minimum  amount of time that you want objects to stay in
                 CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another  request
                 to  your  origin  to  determine  whether  the object has been

                 This field is deprecated.  We  recommend  that  you  use  the
                 DefaultTTL field in a cache policy instead of this field. For
                 more information, see Creating cache policies  or  Using  the

                 The default amount of time that you want objects to  stay  in
                 CloudFront  caches before CloudFront forwards another request
                 to your origin to  determine  whether  the  object  has  been
                 updated.  The  value  that you specify applies only when your
                 origin does  not  add  HTTP  headers  such  as  Cache-Control
                 max-age  ,  Cache-Control  s-maxage , and Expires to objects.

              MaxTTL -> (long)
                 This field is deprecated.  We  recommend  that  you  use  the
                 MaxTTL  field  in  a  cache policy instead of this field. For

                 The maximum amount of time that you want objects to  stay  in
                 CloudFront  caches before CloudFront forwards another request
                 to your origin to  determine  whether  the  object  has  been
                 updated.  The  value  that you specify applies only when your
                 origin adds HTTP headers  such  as  Cache-Control  max-age  ,
                 Cache-Control  s-maxage  ,  and  Expires to objects. For more

          CacheBehaviors -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains zero  or  more  CacheBehavior  ele-
              ments.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of cache behaviors for this distribution.

              Items -> (list)
                 Optional:  A  complex  type that contains cache behaviors for
                 this distribution. If Quantity is 0 , you can omit Items .

                 (structure)
                     A complex type that describes  how  CloudFront  processes
                     requests.

                     You must create at least as many cache behaviors (includ-
                     ing the default cache behavior) as you  have  origins  if
                     you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the ori-
                     gins. Each cache behavior specifies the one  origin  from
                     which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two
                     origins and only the default cache behavior, the  default
                     cache  behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from
                     one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                     For the current quota (formerly known as  limit)  on  the
                     number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribu-
                     tion, see Quotas in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide
                     .

                     If  you dont want to specify any cache behaviors, include
                     only an empty CacheBehaviors  element.  Dont  include  an
                     empty CacheBehavior element because this is invalid.

                     To  delete  all  cache behaviors in an existing distribu-
                     tion, update the distribution configuration  and  include
                     only an empty CacheBehaviors element.

                     To  add,  change,  or remove one or more cache behaviors,
                     update the distribution configuration and specify all  of
                     the  cache  behaviors  that  you  want  to include in the
                     updated distribution.

                     For more information about  cache  behaviors,  see  Cache
                     Behavior  Settings  in  the  Amazon  CloudFront Developer
                     Guide .

                     PathPattern -> (string)
                        The pattern (for example, images/*.jpg )  that  speci-
                        fies  which  requests  to  apply the behavior to. When
                        CloudFront receives a viewer  request,  the  requested
                        path  is  compared  with path patterns in the order in
                        which cache behaviors are listed in the  distribution.

                        NOTE:
                            You  can  optionally  include  a slash (/ ) at the
                            beginning  of  the  path  pattern.  For   example,
                            /images/*.jpg  .  CloudFront  behavior is the same
                            with or without the leading / .

                        The path pattern for the default cache behavior  is  *
                        and  cannot  be  changed. If the request for an object
                        does not match the path pattern for any  cache  behav-
                        iors,  CloudFront  applies the behavior in the default
                        cache behavior.

                        For more information, see Path Pattern in  the  Amazon
                        CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     TargetOriginId -> (string)
                        The  value  of  ID for the origin that you want Cloud-
                        Front to route requests to when they match this  cache
                        behavior.

                     TrustedSigners -> (structure)

                        WARNING:
                            We  recommend  using  TrustedKeyGroups  instead of
                            TrustedSigners .

                        A list of Amazon Web Services account IDs whose public
                        keys  CloudFront  can  use  to validate signed URLs or
                        signed cookies.

                        When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, Cloud-
                        Front  requires  signed URLs or signed cookies for all
                        requests that match the cache behavior.  The  URLs  or
                        cookies  must  be  signed  with  the  private key of a
                        CloudFront key pair in the trusted signers Amazon  Web
                        Services  account.  The  signed URL or cookie contains
                        information about which public key  CloudFront  should
                        use to verify the signature. For more information, see
                        Serving  private  content  in  the  Amazon  CloudFront
                        Developer Guide .

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            This  field  is true if any of the Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices accounts have public  keys  that  CloudFront
                            can  use  to  verify the signatures of signed URLs
                            and signed cookies. If not, this field is false  .

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the
                            list.

                        Items -> (list)
                            A list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers.

                            (string)

                     TrustedKeyGroups -> (structure)
                        A  list of key groups that CloudFront can use to vali-
                        date signed URLs or signed cookies.

                        When a cache behavior  contains  trusted  key  groups,
                        CloudFront  requires signed URLs or signed cookies for
                        all requests that match the cache behavior.  The  URLs
                        or  cookies  must  be  signed with a private key whose
                        corresponding public key is  in  the  key  group.  The
                        signed  URL or cookie contains information about which
                        public key CloudFront should use to verify the  signa-
                        ture.  For  more information, see Serving private con-
                        tent in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            This field is true if any of the key groups in the
                            list  have  public keys that CloudFront can use to
                            verify the signatures of signed  URLs  and  signed
                            cookies. If not, this field is false .

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of key groups in the list.

                        Items -> (list)
                            A list of key groups identifiers.

                            (string)

                     ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                        The  protocol that viewers can use to access the files
                        in the  origin  specified  by  TargetOriginId  when  a
                        request  matches the path pattern in PathPattern . You
                        can specify the following options:

                        o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                        o redirect-to-https : If  a  viewer  submits  an  HTTP
                          request,  CloudFront  returns an HTTP status code of
                          301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the
                          HTTPS  URL.  The  viewer  then resubmits the request
                          using the new URL.

                        o https-only : If a  viewer  sends  an  HTTP  request,
                          CloudFront  returns an HTTP status code of 403 (For-
                          bidden).

                        Front in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        NOTE:
                            The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an
                            object  that  was  fetched  from  the origin using
                            HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to  fetch
                            the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP
                            to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects
                            cache  because  cached objects are protocol agnos-
                            tic. That means that an edge location will  return
                            an object from the cache regardless of whether the
                            current request protocol matches the protocol used
                            previously.  For  more  information,  see Managing

                     AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                        A complex type that controls which HTTP methods Cloud-
                        Front processes and forwards to your Amazon S3  bucket
                        or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                        o CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.

                        o CloudFront  forwards  only  GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS
                          requests.

                        o CloudFront forwards GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT,  PATCH,
                          POST , and DELETE requests.

                        If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict
                        access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom ori-
                        gin  so  users can't perform operations that you don't
                        want them to. For example, you might not want users to
                        have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  HTTP methods that you want Cloud-
                            Front to forward to your origin. Valid values  are
                            2 (for GET and HEAD requests), 3 (for GET , HEAD ,
                            and  OPTIONS  requests)  and  7  (for  GET,  HEAD,
                            OPTIONS,  PUT, PATCH, POST , and DELETE requests).

                        Items -> (list)
                            A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that
                            you want CloudFront to process and forward to your
                            origin.

                            (string)

                        CachedMethods -> (structure)
                            A complex type that  controls  whether  CloudFront
                            caches  the  response to requests using the speci-
                            fied HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                            o CloudFront caches  responses  to  GET  and  HEAD
                              requests.

                            o CloudFront  caches responses to GET , HEAD , and
                              OPTIONS requests.

                            If you pick the second choice for your  Amazon  S3
                            Origin,   you  may  need  to  forward  Access-Con-
                            trol-Request-Method,  Access-Control-Request-Head-
                            ers,  and  Origin  headers for the responses to be
                            cached correctly.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of HTTP methods for which  you  want
                               CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are
                               2  (for  caching  responses  to  GET  and  HEAD
                               requests) and 3 (for caching responses to GET ,
                               HEAD , and OPTIONS requests).

                            Items -> (list)
                               A complex type that contains the  HTTP  methods
                               that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                               (string)

                     SmoothStreaming -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether you want to distribute  media  files
                        in  the  Microsoft  Smooth  Streaming format using the
                        origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If
                        so,  specify  true  ;  if  not, specify false . If you
                        specify true for SmoothStreaming , you can still  dis-
                        tribute other content using this cache behavior if the
                        content matches the value of PathPattern .

                     Compress -> (boolean)
                        Whether you want CloudFront to automatically  compress
                        certain  files for this cache behavior. If so, specify
                        true; if not, specify false. For more information, see
                        Serving  Compressed  Files  in  the  Amazon CloudFront

                     LambdaFunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                        A complex type that contains zero or more  Lambda@Edge
                        function associations for a cache behavior.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  Lambda@Edge function associations
                            for this cache behavior.

                        Items -> (list)
                               Optional : A complex type that contains Lambda-
                               FunctionAssociation items for this cache behav-
                               ior. If Quantity is 0 , you can omit Items .

                            (structure)
                               A complex  type  that  contains  a  Lambda@Edge
                               function association.

                               LambdaFunctionARN -> (string)
                                   The  ARN  of  the Lambda@Edge function. You
                                   must specify the ARN of a function version;
                                   you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                               EventType -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  event  type that triggers a
                                   Lambda@Edge function  invocation.  You  can
                                   specify the following values:

                                   o viewer-request  :  The  function executes
                                     when CloudFront receives a request from a
                                     viewer   and  before  it  checks  to  see
                                     whether the requested object  is  in  the
                                     edge cache.

                                   o origin-request  :  The  function executes
                                     only when CloudFront sends a  request  to
                                     your origin. When the requested object is
                                     in the edge cache, the  function  doesn't
                                     execute.

                                   o origin-response  :  The function executes
                                     after CloudFront receives a response from
                                     the  origin  and  before  it  caches  the
                                     object  in   the   response.   When   the
                                     requested  object  is  in the edge cache,
                                     the function doesn't execute.

                                   o viewer-response : The  function  executes
                                     before  CloudFront  returns the requested
                                     object to the viewer. The  function  exe-
                                     cutes  regardless  of  whether the object
                                     was already in the  edge  cache.  If  the
                                     origin  returns an HTTP status code other
                                     than HTTP 200 (OK), the function  doesn't
                                     execute.

                               IncludeBody -> (boolean)
                                   A  flag  that allows a Lambda@Edge function
                                   to have read access to  the  body  content.

                     FunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                        A list of CloudFront  functions  that  are  associated
                        with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be
                        published to the LIVE stage to associate them  with  a
                        cache behavior.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of CloudFront functions in the list.

                            a cache behavior  in  a  CloudFront  distribution.
                            CloudFront functions must be published to the LIVE
                            stage to associate them with a cache behavior.

                            (structure)
                               A CloudFront function that is associated with a
                               cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution.

                               FunctionARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the func-
                                   tion.

                               EventType -> (string)
                                   The event  type  of  the  function,  either
                                   viewer-request  or  viewer-response  .  You
                                   cannot use origin-facing event types  (ori-
                                   gin-request  and  origin-response  ) with a
                                   CloudFront function.

                     FieldLevelEncryptionId -> (string)
                        The value of ID for the field-level encryption config-
                        uration that you want CloudFront to use for encrypting
                        specific fields of data for this cache behavior.

                     RealtimeLogConfigArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  real-time  log
                        configuration that is attached to this cache behavior.
                        For more information, see Real-time logs in the Amazon
                        CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     CachePolicyId -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier  of  the  cache policy that is
                        attached to this cache behavior. For more information,
                        see Creating cache policies or Using the managed cache
                        policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        A CacheBehavior must include either a CachePolicyId or
                        ForwardedValues  . We recommend that you use a CacheP-
                        olicyId .

                     OriginRequestPolicyId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier of  the  origin  request  policy
                        that  is  attached  to  this  cache behavior. For more

                     ResponseHeadersPolicyId -> (string)
                        The identifier for a response headers policy.

                     ForwardedValues -> (structure)
                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use  a
                        cache  policy  or  an origin request policy instead of
                        this field. For more  information,  see  Working  with
                        policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        If  you want to include values in the cache key, use a
                        cache policy. For more information, see Creating cache
                        policies  or  Using  the managed cache policies in the
                        Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        If you want to send  values  to  the  origin  but  not
                        include  them  in the cache key, use an origin request
                        policy. For  more  information,  see  Creating  origin
                        request  policies  or Using the managed origin request
                        policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        A CacheBehavior must include either a CachePolicyId or
                        ForwardedValues  . We recommend that you use a CacheP-
                        olicyId .

                        A complex type that specifies how  CloudFront  handles
                        query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                        QueryString -> (boolean)
                            This  field  is  deprecated. We recommend that you
                            use a cache policy or  an  origin  request  policy
                            instead of this field.

                            If  you want to include query strings in the cache
                            key, use a cache policy. For more information, see
                            Creating  cache  policies in the Amazon CloudFront
                            Developer Guide .

                            If you want to send query strings  to  the  origin
                            but not include them in the cache key, use an ori-
                            gin request  policy.  For  more  information,  see
                            Creating  origin  request  policies  in the Amazon
                            CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            Indicates whether you want CloudFront  to  forward
                            query  strings  to  the  origin that is associated
                            with this cache behavior and cache  based  on  the
                            query   string   parameters.  CloudFront  behavior
                            depends on the value of  QueryString  and  on  the
                            values that you specify for QueryStringCacheKeys ,
                            if any:

                            If you specify true for QueryString and you  don't
                            specify  any  values  for  QueryStringCacheKeys  ,
                            CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to
                            the  origin  and  caches based on all query string
                            parameters. Depending on  how  many  query  string
                            parameters and values you have, this can adversely
                            affect performance because CloudFront must forward
                            more requests to the origin.

                            If  you specify true for QueryString and you spec-
                            ify one or more values for QueryStringCacheKeys  ,
                            CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to
                            the origin, but it only caches based on the  query
                            string parameters that you specify.

                            If  you specify false for QueryString , CloudFront
                            doesn't forward any query string parameters to the
                            origin,  and  doesn't  cache based on query string
                            parameters.

                            For more information, see  Configuring  CloudFront

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            This field is deprecated. We  recommend  that  you
                            use  a  cache  policy  or an origin request policy
                            instead of this field.

                            If you want to include cookies in the  cache  key,
                            use  a  cache  policy.  For  more information, see

                            If  you want to send cookies to the origin but not
                            include them in  the  cache  key,  use  an  origin
                            request policy. For more information, see Creating

                            A  complex  type  that  specifies whether you want
                            CloudFront to forward cookies to the  origin  and,
                            if so, which ones. For more information about for-

                               If you want to send cookies to the  origin  but
                               not  include them in the cache key, use an ori-
                               gin request policy. For more  information,  see
                               Creating  origin request policies in the Amazon

                               Required if you specify whitelist for the value
                               of  Forward . A complex type that specifies how
                               many different cookies you want  CloudFront  to
                               forward  to  the origin for this cache behavior
                               and, if you want to forward  selected  cookies,
                               the names of those cookies.

                               If  you  specify  all  or none for the value of
                               Forward , omit WhitelistedNames . If you change
                               the  value  of Forward from whitelist to all or
                               none and you don't delete the  WhitelistedNames
                               element  and  its  child  elements,  CloudFront
                               deletes them automatically.

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            This field is deprecated. We  recommend  that  you
                            use  a  cache  policy  or an origin request policy
                            instead of this field.

                            If you want to include headers in the  cache  key,
                            use  a  cache  policy.  For  more information, see

                            If  you want to send headers to the origin but not
                            include them in  the  cache  key,  use  an  origin

                            also  caches  separate  versions  of  a  specified
                            object that is  based  on  the  header  values  in
                            viewer requests.

                            instead of this field.

                            If  you want to include query strings in the cache
                            key, use a cache policy. For more information, see

                     MinTTL -> (long)
                        This field is deprecated. We recommend  that  you  use
                        the  MinTTL  field  in  a cache policy instead of this

          CustomErrorResponses -> (structure)
              A complex type that controls the following:

              o Whether  CloudFront  replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and
                5xx range with custom  error  messages  before  returning  the
                response to the viewer.

              o How  long  CloudFront  caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and
                5xx range.

              For more information about custom error pages,  see  Customizing
              Error Responses in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify
                 a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If Quantity is
                 0 , you can omit Items .

              Items -> (list)
                 A  complex  type  that contains a CustomErrorResponse element
                 for each HTTP status code for which you  want  to  specify  a
                 custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type that controls:

                     o Whether  CloudFront  replaces  HTTP status codes in the
                       4xx and 5xx range with  custom  error  messages  before
                       returning the response to the viewer.

                     o How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx
                       and 5xx range.

                     For  more  information  about  custom  error  pages,  see
                     Customizing  Error  Responses  in  the  Amazon CloudFront
                     Developer Guide .

                     ErrorCode -> (integer)
                        The HTTP status code for which you want to  specify  a
                        custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                     ResponsePagePath -> (string)
                        The path to the custom error page that you want Cloud-
                        Front to return to a viewer when your  origin  returns
                        the  HTTP  status  code  specified  by ErrorCode , for
                        example, /4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html . If you  want
                        to  store  your objects and your custom error pages in
                        different locations, your distribution must include  a
                        cache behavior for which the following is true:

                        o The  value  of  PathPattern matches the path to your
                          custom error  messages.  For  example,  suppose  you
                          saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon
                          S3 bucket in a directory named  /4xx-errors  .  Your
                          distribution must include a cache behavior for which
                          the path pattern routes  requests  for  your  custom
                          error   pages   to   that   location,  for  example,
                          /4xx-errors/* .

                        o The value of TargetOriginId specifies the  value  of
                          the  ID  element  for  the origin that contains your
                          custom error pages.

                        If you specify a value for ResponsePagePath , you must
                        also specify a value for ResponseCode .

                        We  recommend  that you store custom error pages in an
                        Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error  pages  on
                        an  HTTP  server  and  the server starts to return 5xx
                        errors, CloudFront can't get the files that  you  want
                        to  return  to  viewers  because  the origin server is
                        unavailable.

                     ResponseCode -> (string)
                        The HTTP status  code  that  you  want  CloudFront  to
                        return to the viewer along with the custom error page.
                        There are a variety of reasons  that  you  might  want
                        CloudFront  to return a status code different from the
                        status code that your origin returned  to  CloudFront,
                        for example:

                        o Some  Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate
                          proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and
                          prevent  the  response  from  being  returned to the
                          viewer. If you substitute 200 , the  response  typi-
                          cally won't be intercepted.

                        o If you don't care about distinguishing among differ-
                          ent client errors or server errors, you can  specify
                          400  or  500  as the ResponseCode for all 4xx or 5xx
                          errors.

                        o You might want to return a 200 status code (OK)  and
                          static  website  so  your  customers don't know that
                          your website is down.

                        If you specify a value for  ResponseCode  ,  you  must
                        also specify a value for ResponsePagePath .

                     ErrorCachingMinTTL -> (long)
                        The  minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want
                        CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified  in
                        ErrorCode  . When this time period has elapsed, Cloud-
                        Front queries your origin to see whether  the  problem
                        that  caused  the  error  has  been  resolved  and the
                        requested object is now available.

                        in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          Comment -> (string)
              An  optional  comment  to describe the distribution. The comment
              cannot be longer than 128 characters.

          Logging -> (structure)
              A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for
              the distribution.

                 Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs  to
                 an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when
                 you create a distribution or if you want to  disable  logging
                 for an existing distribution, specify false for Enabled , and
                 specify empty Bucket and  Prefix  elements.  If  you  specify
                 false  for Enabled but you specify values for Bucket , prefix
                 , and IncludeCookies , the values are automatically  deleted.

              IncludeCookies -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  you want CloudFront to include cookies in
                 access logs, specify true for IncludeCookies . If you  choose
                 to  include  cookies  in  logs,  CloudFront  logs all cookies
                 regardless of how you configure the cache behaviors for  this
                 distribution.  If  you don't want to include cookies when you
                 create a distribution or if you want to disable include cook-
                 ies  for an existing distribution, specify false for Include-
                 Cookies .

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in,  for  exam-
                 ple, myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 An  optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the
                 access log filenames  for  this  distribution,  for  example,
                 myprefix/ . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want
                 to specify a prefix, you still must include an  empty  Prefix
                 element in the Logging element.

          PriceClass -> (string)
              The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you
              want to pay  for  CloudFront  service.  If  you  specify  Price-
              Class_All  ,  CloudFront  responds  to requests for your objects
              from all CloudFront edge locations.

              If you specify a price class other than PriceClass_All ,  Cloud-
              Front serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that
              has the lowest latency among the edge locations  in  your  price
              class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from
              your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

              For more information about price classes, see Choosing the Price
              Class  for  a  CloudFront  Distribution in the Amazon CloudFront
              Developer Guide .  For  information  about  CloudFront  pricing,
              including  how  price  classes  (such as Price Class 100) map to
              CloudFront regions, see Amazon CloudFront Pricing .

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              From this field, you can enable or disable the selected  distri-
              bution.

          ViewerCertificate -> (structure)
              A complex type that determines the distributions SSL/TLS config-
              uration for communicating with viewers.

              CloudFrontDefaultCertificate -> (boolean)
                 If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name  such  as
                 d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net , set this field to true .

                 If  the  distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names or
                 CNAMEs), set this field to false and specify values  for  the
                 following fields:

                 o ACMCertificateArn  or IAMCertificateId (specify a value for
                   one, not both)

                 o MinimumProtocolVersion

                 o SSLSupportMethod

              IAMCertificateId -> (string)
                 If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names  or
                 CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in Identity and
                 Access Management (IAM) , provide the ID of the IAM  certifi-
                 cate.

                 If  you  specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify
                 values for MinimumProtocolVersion and SSLSupportMethod .

              ACMCertificateArn -> (string)
                 If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names  or
                 CNAMEs)  and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in Certificate
                 Manager (ACM) , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
                 ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in
                 the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1 ).

                 If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also  specify
                 values for MinimumProtocolVersion and SSLSupportMethod .

              SSLSupportMethod -> (string)
                 If  the  distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names or
                 CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS
                 connections from.

                 o sni-only   The  distribution accepts HTTPS connections from
                   only viewers that support server name  indication  (SNI)  .
                   This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI.

                 o vip  The distribution accepts HTTPS  connections  from  all
                   viewers  including those that dont support SNI. This is not
                   recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from
                   CloudFront.

                 o static-ip - Do not specify this value unless your distribu-
                   tion has been enabled for this feature  by  the  CloudFront
                   team.  If  you  have  a  use  case  that requires static IP
                   addresses for a distribution,  contact  CloudFront  through
                   the Amazon Web Services Support Center .

                 If  the  distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as
                 d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net , dont set  a  value  for  this
                 field.

              MinimumProtocolVersion -> (string)
                 If  the  distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names or
                 CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront
                 to  use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security pol-
                 icy determines two settings:

                 o The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that  CloudFront  can  use  to
                   communicate with viewers.

                 o The  ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content
                   that it returns to viewers.

                 For more information, see Security Policy and Supported  Pro-
                 tocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront in the Ama-
                 zon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     On the CloudFront console, this setting is  called  Secu-
                     rity Policy .

                 When  youre  using  SNI  only  (you  set  SSLSupportMethod to
                 sni-only ), you must specify TLSv1 or higher.

                 If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name  such  as
                 d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net  (you set CloudFrontDefaultCer-
                 tificate to true ), CloudFront automatically sets  the  secu-
                 rity  policy  to  TLSv1  regardless of the value that you set
                 here.

              Certificate -> (string)
                 This field is deprecated. Use one  of  the  following  fields
                 instead:

                 o ACMCertificateArn

                 o IAMCertificateId

                 o CloudFrontDefaultCertificate

              CertificateSource -> (string)
                 This  field  is  deprecated.  Use one of the following fields
                 instead:

                 o ACMCertificateArn

                 o IAMCertificateId

                 o CloudFrontDefaultCertificate

          Restrictions -> (structure)
              A complex type  that  identifies  ways  in  which  you  want  to
              restrict distribution of your content.

              GeoRestriction -> (structure)
                 A complex type that controls the countries in which your con-
                 tent is distributed. CloudFront determines  the  location  of
                 your users using MaxMind GeoIP databases.

                 RestrictionType -> (string)
                     The  method that you want to use to restrict distribution
                     of your content by country:

                     o none : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to
                       content is not restricted by client geo location.

                     o blacklist : The Location elements specify the countries
                       in which you don't want CloudFront to  distribute  your
                       content.

                     o whitelist : The Location elements specify the countries
                       in which you want CloudFront to  distribute  your  con-
                       tent.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     When  geo  restriction is enabled , this is the number of
                     countries in your whitelist  or  blacklist  .  Otherwise,
                     when  it is not enabled, Quantity is 0 , and you can omit
                     Items .

                 Items -> (list)
                     A complex type that contains a Location element for  each
                     country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute
                     your content (whitelist ) or not distribute your  content
                     (blacklist ).

                     The  Location  element is a two-letter, uppercase country
                     code for a country that  you  want  to  include  in  your
                     blacklist or whitelist . Include one Location element for
                     each country.

                     CloudFront and MaxMind both use ISO 3166  country  codes.
                     For  the  current list of countries and the corresponding
                     codes, see ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code on  the  International
                     Organization  for  Standardization  website. You can also
                     refer to the country  list  on  the  CloudFront  console,
                     which includes both country names and codes.

                     (string)

          WebACLId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to
              associate with this distribution. To specify a web  ACL  created
              using  the  latest  version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example
              arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWe-
              bACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a . To specify a web ACL
              created  using  WAF  Classic,  use  the  ACL  ID,  for   example
              473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a .

              WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP
              and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to  CloudFront,  and  lets
              you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you
              specify, such as the IP addresses that requests  originate  from
              or  the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests
              either with the requested content or with  an  HTTP  403  status
              code  (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a
              custom error page when a request is blocked. For  more  informa-
              tion about WAF, see the WAF Developer Guide .

          HttpVersion -> (string)
              (Optional)  Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want view-
              ers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value for
              new  web  distributions  is  http2.  Viewers  that don't support
              HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

              For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers  must  support
              TLS  1.2  or  later, and must support Server Name Identification
              (SNI).

              In general, configuring CloudFront to communicate  with  viewers
              using  HTTP/2  reduces  latency.  You can improve performance by
              optimizing for HTTP/2. For  more  information,  do  an  Internet
              search for "http/2 optimization."

          IsIPV6Enabled -> (boolean)
              If  you  want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an
              IPv6 address for your distribution, specify true . If you  spec-
              ify  false  ,  CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the
              DNS response code NOERROR and with no IP addresses. This  allows
              viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your
              distribution.

              In general, you should enable IPv6 if you  have  users  on  IPv6
              networks  who  want  to  access your content. However, if you're
              using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access  to  your
              content,  and  if you're using a custom policy that includes the
              IpAddress parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access
              your  content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access
              to some content by IP address and not restrict access  to  other
              content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can cre-
              ate two distributions. For  more  information,  see  Creating  a
              Signed URL Using a Custom Policy in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
              oper Guide .

              If you're using an Route  53  Amazon  Web  Services  Integration
              alias  resource  record  set to route traffic to your CloudFront
              distribution, you need to create a second alias resource  record
              set when both of the following are true:

              o You enable IPv6 for the distribution

              o You're  using  alternate  domain  names  in  the URLs for your
                objects

              For more information, see Routing Traffic to  an  Amazon  Cloud-
              Front Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name in the Route 53
              Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide .

              If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53
              Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you
              don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route  traf-
              fic  to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of
              the viewer request.

       --id (string)
          The distribution's id.

       --if-match (string)
          The value of the ETag header that you received when  retrieving  the
          distribution's configuration. For example: E2QWRUHAPOMQZL .

       --default-root-object  (string)  The object that you want CloudFront to
       return (for example, index.html) when a viewer request points  to  your
       root URL. CLI will automatically make a get-distribution-config call to
       load and preserve your other settings. This  argument  and  --distribu-
       tion-config are mututally exclusive.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a CloudFront distribution's default root object

       The following example updates the default root object to index.html for
       the CloudFront distribution with the ID EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE:

          aws cloudfront update-distribution --id EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE \
              --default-root-object index.html

       Output:

       To update a CloudFront distribution

       The following example disables the CloudFront distribution with the  ID
       EMLARXS9EXAMPLE  by  providing the distribution configuration in a JSON
       file named dist-config-disable.json. To update a distribution, you must
       use  the  --if-match  option to provide the distribution's ETag. To get
       the ETag, use the get-distribution or get-distribution-config  command.

       After  you use the following example to disable a distribution, you can
       use the delete-distribution command to delete it.

          aws cloudfront update-distribution \
              --id EMLARXS9EXAMPLE \
              --if-match E2QWRUHEXAMPLE \
              --distribution-config file://dist-config-disable.json

       The file dist-config-disable.json is a JSON  document  in  the  current
       folder  that contains the following. Note that the Enabled field is set
       to false:

                            (string)

          ActiveTrustedKeyGroups -> (structure)
              CloudFront automatically adds this  field  to  the  response  if
              youve  configured a cache behavior in this distribution to serve
              private content using key groups. This field contains a list  of
              key groups and the public keys in each key group that CloudFront
              can use to verify the signatures of signed URLs or signed  cook-
              ies.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 This  field is true if any of the key groups have public keys
                 that CloudFront can use to verify the  signatures  of  signed
                 URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is false .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of key groups in the list.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of key groups, including the identifiers of the public
                 keys in each key group that CloudFront can use to verify  the
                 signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies.

                 (structure)
                     A list of identifiers for the public keys that CloudFront
                     can use to verify  the  signatures  of  signed  URLs  and

                     KeyGroupId -> (string)
                        The identifier of the key group that contains the pub-
                        lic keys.

                     KeyPairIds -> (structure)
                        A list of CloudFront key pair identifiers.

                        Quantity -> (integer)

                        Items -> (list)
                            A list of CloudFront key pair identifiers.

                            (string)

          DistributionConfig -> (structure)
              The current configuration information for the distribution. Send
              a  GET  request  to  the /*CloudFront API version* /distribution
              ID/config resource.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that  ensures
                 that the request can't be replayed.

                 If  the  value  of  CallerReference is new (regardless of the
                 content of the DistributionConfig object), CloudFront creates
                 a new distribution.

                 If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a pre-
                 vious request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns  a
                 DistributionAlreadyExists error.

              Aliases -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alter-
                 nate domain names), if any, for this distribution.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to as-
                     sociate with this distribution.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A  complex  type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any,
                     that you want to associate with this distribution.

                     (string)

              DefaultRootObject -> (string)
                 The object that you want CloudFront to request from your ori-
                 gin  (for  example,  index.html  ) when a viewer requests the
                 root URL  for  your  distribution  (http://www.example.com  )
                 instead  of  an object in your distribution (http://www.exam-
                 ple.com/product-description.html ). Specifying a default root
                 object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

                 Specify only the object name, for example, index.html . Don't
                 add a / before the object name.

                 If you don't want to specify a default root object  when  you
                 create  a  distribution,  include  an empty DefaultRootObject
                 element.

                 To delete the default root object from an existing  distribu-
                 tion,  update  the  distribution configuration and include an
                 empty DefaultRootObject element.

                 To replace the default root object, update  the  distribution
                 configuration and specify the new object.

                 For  more  information  about  the  default  root object, see
                 Creating a Default  Root  Object  in  the  Amazon  CloudFront
                 Developer Guide .

              Origins -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type  that contains information about origins for
                 this distribution.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of origins for this distribution.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A list of origins.

                     (structure)
                        An origin.

                        An origin is the location where content is stored, and
                        from  which  CloudFront gets content to serve to view-
                        ers. To specify an origin:

                        o Use S3OriginConfig to specify an  Amazon  S3  bucket
                          that  is not configured with static website hosting.

                        o Use CustomOriginConfig to specify all other kinds of
                          origins, including:

                          o An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static
                            website hosting

                          o An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer

                          o An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint

                          o An AWS Elemental MediaStore container

                          o Any other HTTP server, running on  an  Amazon  EC2
                            instance or any other kind of host

                        For the current maximum number of origins that you can
                        specify per distribution, see General  Quotas  on  Web
                        Distributions in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide
                        (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

                        Id -> (string)
                            A unique identifier for  the  origin.  This  value
                            must be unique within the distribution.

                            Use  this value to specify the TargetOriginId in a
                            CacheBehavior or DefaultCacheBehavior .

                        DomainName -> (string)
                            The domain name for the origin.

                            For more information, see Origin  Domain  Name  in
                            the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        OriginPath -> (string)
                            An  optional  path  that CloudFront appends to the
                            origin domain name when CloudFront  requests  con-
                            tent from the origin.

                            For  more information, see Origin Path in the Ama-
                            zon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        CustomHeaders -> (structure)
                            A list of HTTP header names and values that Cloud-
                            Front  adds  to  the requests that it sends to the
                            origin.

                            For more information, see Adding Custom Headers to
                            Origin Requests in the Amazon CloudFront Developer
                            Guide .

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of custom headers, if any, for  this
                               distribution.

                            Items -> (list)
                                   Optional : A list that contains one Origin-
                                   CustomHeader element for each custom header
                                   that  you want CloudFront to forward to the
                                   origin. If Quantity is 0 , omit Items .

                               (structure)
                                   A complex type that contains HeaderName and
                                   HeaderValue elements, if any, for this dis-
                                   tribution.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name  of  a  header  that  you  want
                                      CloudFront  to  send to your origin. For
                                      more  information,  see  Adding   Custom
                                      Headers to Origin Requests in the Amazon
                                      CloudFront Developer Guide .

                                   HeaderValue -> (string)
                                      The value for the header that you speci-
                                      fied in the HeaderName field.

                        S3OriginConfig -> (structure)
                            Use this type to specify an origin that is an Ama-
                            zon S3 bucket that is not configured  with  static
                            website hosting. To specify any other type of ori-
                            gin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is config-
                            ured with static website hosting, use the CustomO-
                            riginConfig type instead.

                            OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                               The CloudFront origin access identity to  asso-
                               ciate  with  the  origin.  Use an origin access
                               identity to configure the origin so that  view-
                               ers  can  only  access  objects in an Amazon S3
                               bucket through CloudFront. The  format  of  the
                               value is:

                               origin-access-identity/cloudfront/ID-of-ori-
                               gin-access-identity

                               where `` ID-of-origin-access-identity `` is the
                               value  that  CloudFront returned in the ID ele-
                               ment when you created the origin  access  iden-
                               tity.

                               If  you  want  viewers  to  be  able  to access
                               objects using either the CloudFront URL or  the
                               Amazon  S3 URL, specify an empty OriginAccessI-
                               dentity element.

                               To delete the origin access  identity  from  an
                               existing  distribution, update the distribution
                               configuration and include an empty OriginAcces-
                               sIdentity element.

                               To  replace  the origin access identity, update
                               the distribution configuration and specify  the
                               new origin access identity.

                               For  more  information  about the origin access
                               identity, see Serving Private  Content  through
                               CloudFront  in  the Amazon CloudFront Developer
                               Guide .

                        CustomOriginConfig -> (structure)
                            Use this type to specify an origin that is not  an
                            Amazon  S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Ama-
                            zon S3 bucket is configured  with  static  website
                            hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is

                            HTTPPort -> (integer)
                               The  HTTP  port that CloudFront uses to connect
                               to the origin. Specify the HTTP port  that  the
                               origin listens on.

                            HTTPSPort -> (integer)
                               The  HTTPS port that CloudFront uses to connect
                               to the origin. Specify the HTTPS port that  the
                               origin listens on.

                            OriginProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                               Specifies  the  protocol  (HTTP  or HTTPS) that
                               CloudFront uses to connect to the origin. Valid
                               values are:

                               o http-only   CloudFront  always  uses  HTTP to
                                 connect to the origin.

                               o match-viewer  CloudFront connects to the ori-
                                 gin  using  the same protocol that the viewer
                                 used to connect to CloudFront.

                               o https-only  CloudFront always uses  HTTPS  to
                                 connect to the origin.

                            OriginSslProtocols -> (structure)
                               Specifies  the  minimum  SSL/TLS  protocol that
                               CloudFront uses when connecting to your  origin
                               over  HTTPS. Valid values include SSLv3 , TLSv1
                               , TLSv1.1 , and TLSv1.2 .

                               Items -> (list)
                                   A list that contains allowed SSL/TLS proto-
                                   cols for this distribution.

                                   (string)

                            OriginReadTimeout -> (integer)
                               Specifies  how  long,  in  seconds,  CloudFront
                               waits  for  a response from the origin. This is
                               also known as the origin response timeout . The
                               minimum  timeout is 1 second, the maximum is 60
                               seconds, and the default (if you  dont  specify
                               otherwise) is 30 seconds.

                            OriginKeepaliveTimeout -> (integer)
                               Specifies how long, in seconds, CloudFront per-
                               sists its connection to the origin. The minimum
                               timeout is 1 second, the maximum is 60 seconds,
                               and the default (if you dont specify otherwise)
                               is 5 seconds.

                        ConnectionAttempts -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  times that CloudFront attempts to
                            connect to the origin. The minimum  number  is  1,
                            the  maximum  is  3,  and the default (if you dont
                            specify otherwise) is 3.

                            For a custom origin (including an Amazon S3 bucket
                            thats  configured  with  static  website hosting),
                            this value also specifies the number of times that
                            CloudFront  attempts  to  get  a response from the
                            origin, in the case of an Origin Response  Timeout
                            .

                            For   more   information,  see  Origin  Connection
                            Attempts in the Amazon CloudFront Developer  Guide
                            .

                        ConnectionTimeout -> (integer)
                            The  number  of seconds that CloudFront waits when
                            trying to establish a connection  to  the  origin.
                            The minimum timeout is 1 second, the maximum is 10
                            seconds, and the default (if you dont specify oth-
                            erwise) is 10 seconds.

                        OriginShield -> (structure)
                            CloudFront Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield  can
                            help reduce the load on your origin.

                            For  more  information, see Using Origin Shield in
                            the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            Enabled -> (boolean)
                               A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield  is
                               enabled.

                               When   its   enabled,   CloudFront  routes  all
                               requests through Origin Shield, which can  help
                               protect  your origin. When its disabled, Cloud-
                               Front might send requests directly to your ori-
                               gin  from  multiple  edge locations or regional
                               edge caches.

                            OriginShieldRegion -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Web  Services  Region  for  Origin
                               Shield.

                               Specify the Amazon Web Services Region that has
                               the lowest latency to your origin. To specify a
                               region,  use  the  region  code, not the region
                               name. For example, specify the US  East  (Ohio)
                               region as us-east-2 .

                               When  you  enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you
                               must specify the Amazon Web Services Region for
                               Origin  Shield. For the list of Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices Regions that you  can  specify,  and  for

              OriginGroups -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about origin  groups
                 for this distribution.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of origin groups.

                 Items -> (list)
                     The items (origin groups) in a distribution.

                     (structure)
                        An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin
                        and a second origin to failover  to)  and  a  failover
                        criteria  that you specify. You create an origin group
                        to support origin failover  in  CloudFront.  When  you
                        create  or update a distribution, you can specifiy the
                        origin group instead of a single  origin,  and  Cloud-
                        Front  will  failover  from  the primary origin to the
                        second  origin  under  the  failover  conditions  that
                        you've chosen.

                            The origin group's ID.

                        FailoverCriteria -> (structure)
                            A complex type that contains information about the
                            failover criteria for an origin group.

                            StatusCodes -> (structure)
                               The status codes that, when returned  from  the
                               primary  origin,  will  trigger  CloudFront  to
                               failover to the second origin.

                               Quantity -> (integer)
                                   The number of status codes.

                               Items -> (list)
                                   The items  (status  codes)  for  an  origin
                                   group.

                                   (integer)

                        Members -> (structure)
                            A complex type that contains information about the
                            origins in an origin group.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of origins in an origin group.

                            Items -> (list)
                               Items (origins) in an origin group.

                               (structure)
                                   An origin in an origin group.

                                   OriginId -> (string)
                                      The ID for an origin in an origin group.

              DefaultCacheBehavior -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type that describes the default cache behavior if
                 you don't specify a CacheBehavior element or if  files  don't
                 match  any of the values of PathPattern in CacheBehavior ele-
                 ments. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

                 TargetOriginId -> (string)
                     The value of ID for the origin that you  want  CloudFront
                     to  route  requests  to  when  they use the default cache
                     behavior.

                 TrustedSigners -> (structure)

                     WARNING:
                        We recommend using TrustedKeyGroups instead of  Trust-
                        edSigners .

                     A  list  of  Amazon Web Services account IDs whose public
                     keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed
                     cookies.

                     When  a  cache  behavior contains trusted signers, Cloud-
                     Front requires signed URLs  or  signed  cookies  for  all
                     requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cook-
                     ies must be signed with the private key of  a  CloudFront
                     key  pair  in  a  trusted  signers  Amazon  Web  Services
                     account. The signed URL or  cookie  contains  information
                     about  which  public  key CloudFront should use to verify
                     the signature. For more information, see Serving  private
                     content in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        This  field  is true if any of the Amazon Web Services
                        accounts have public keys that CloudFront can  use  to
                        verify  the signatures of signed URLs and signed cook-
                        ies. If not, this field is false .

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of Amazon  Web  Services  accounts  in  the

                        (string)

                 TrustedKeyGroups -> (structure)
                     A  list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate
                     signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, Cloud-
                     Front  requires  signed  URLs  or  signed cookies for all
                     requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cook-
                     ies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding
                     public key is in the key group. The signed URL or  cookie
                     contains  information  about  which public key CloudFront
                     should use to verify the signature. For more information,
                     see  Serving  private  content  in  the Amazon CloudFront

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        This field is true if any of the  key  groups  in  the
                        list  have public keys that CloudFront can use to ver-
                        ify the signatures of signed URLs and signed  cookies.
                        If not, this field is false .

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of key groups in the list.

                     Items -> (list)
                        A list of key groups identifiers.

                        (string)

                 ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                     The  protocol that viewers can use to access the files in
                     the origin specified by  TargetOriginId  when  a  request
                     matches the path pattern in PathPattern . You can specify
                     the following options:

                     o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                     o redirect-to-https  :  If  a  viewer  submits  an   HTTP
                       request,  CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301
                       (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the  HTTPS
                       URL.  The  viewer  then resubmits the request using the
                       new URL.

                     o https-only : If a viewer sends an HTTP request,  Cloud-
                       Front returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).

                     For  more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol,
                     see Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront in the
                     Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        The  only  way  to  guarantee that viewers retrieve an
                        object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is
                        never  to  use any other protocol to fetch the object.
                        If you have recently changed from HTTP  to  HTTPS,  we
                        recommend  that  you  clear your objects cache because
                        cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means  that
                        an  edge location will return an object from the cache
                        regardless of whether  the  current  request  protocol
                        matches  the protocol used previously. For more infor-
                        mation, see Managing Cache Expiration  in  the  Amazon
                        CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                     A  complex  type  that controls which HTTP methods Cloud-
                     Front processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket  or
                     your custom origin. There are three choices:

                     o CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.

                     o CloudFront  forwards  only  GET  ,  HEAD  , and OPTIONS
                       requests.

                     o CloudFront forwards GET,  HEAD,  OPTIONS,  PUT,  PATCH,
                       POST , and DELETE requests.

                     If  you  pick  the third choice, you may need to restrict
                     access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom  origin
                     so  users  can't  perform  operations that you don't want
                     them to. For example, you might not want  users  to  have
                     permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to
                        forward to your origin. Valid values are  2  (for  GET
                        and  HEAD  requests),  3 (for GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS
                        requests) and 7 (for GET, HEAD, OPTIONS,  PUT,  PATCH,
                        POST , and DELETE requests).

                     Items -> (list)
                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you
                        want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                        (string)

                     CachedMethods -> (structure)
                        A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches
                        the response to  requests  using  the  specified  HTTP
                        methods. There are two choices:

                        o CloudFront   caches   responses   to  GET  and  HEAD
                          requests.

                        o CloudFront caches responses to  GET  ,  HEAD  ,  and
                          OPTIONS requests.

                        If  you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Ori-
                        gin,   you   may   need   to    forward    Access-Con-
                        trol-Request-Method,   Access-Control-Request-Headers,
                        and Origin headers for the responses to be cached cor-
                        rectly.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  HTTP  methods  for which you want
                            CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are  2
                            (for  caching  responses to GET and HEAD requests)
                            and 3 (for caching responses to GET , HEAD  ,  and
                            OPTIONS requests).

                        Items -> (list)
                            A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that
                            you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                            (string)

                 SmoothStreaming -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether you want to distribute media  files  in
                     the  Microsoft  Smooth  Streaming format using the origin
                     that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, spec-
                     ify  true  ;  if not, specify false . If you specify true
                     for SmoothStreaming , you can still distribute other con-
                     tent using this cache behavior if the content matches the
                     value of PathPattern .

                 Compress -> (boolean)
                     Whether you want  CloudFront  to  automatically  compress
                     certain  files  for  this  cache behavior. If so, specify
                     true ; if not, specify false . For more information,  see
                     Serving  Compressed Files in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
                     oper Guide .

                 LambdaFunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                     A complex type that contains  zero  or  more  Lambda@Edge
                     function associations for a cache behavior.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  Lambda@Edge function associations for
                        this cache behavior.

                     Items -> (list)
                            Optional : A complex type  that  contains  Lambda-
                            FunctionAssociation items for this cache behavior.
                            If Quantity is 0 , you can omit Items .

                        (structure)
                            A complex type that contains a  Lambda@Edge  func-
                            tion association.

                            LambdaFunctionARN -> (string)
                               The  ARN  of the Lambda@Edge function. You must
                               specify the ARN  of  a  function  version;  you
                               can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                            EventType -> (string)
                               Specifies   the  event  type  that  triggers  a
                               Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can  spec-
                               ify the following values:

                               o viewer-request  :  The function executes when
                                 CloudFront receives a request from  a  viewer
                                 and  before  it  checks  to  see  whether the
                                 requested object is in the edge cache.

                               o origin-request : The function  executes  only
                                 when  CloudFront sends a request to your ori-
                                 gin. When the requested object is in the edge
                                 cache, the function doesn't execute.

                               o origin-response : The function executes after
                                 CloudFront receives a response from the  ori-
                                 gin  and  before  it caches the object in the
                                 response. When the requested object is in the
                                 edge cache, the function doesn't execute.

                               o viewer-response   :   The  function  executes
                                 before  CloudFront  returns   the   requested
                                 object  to  the viewer. The function executes
                                 regardless of whether the object was  already
                                 in  the  edge cache. If the origin returns an
                                 HTTP status code other than  HTTP  200  (OK),
                                 the function doesn't execute.

                            IncludeBody -> (boolean)
                               A  flag  that  allows a Lambda@Edge function to
                               have read access to the body content. For  more
                               information,  see Accessing the Request Body by
                               Choosing the Include Body Option in the  Amazon
                               CloudFront Developer Guide.

                 FunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                     A  list  of CloudFront functions that are associated with
                     this cache behavior. CloudFront functions  must  be  pub-
                     lished  to  the LIVE stage to associate them with a cache
                     behavior.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of CloudFront functions in the list.

                     Items -> (list)
                        The CloudFront functions that are  associated  with  a
                        cache  behavior  in  a CloudFront distribution. Cloud-
                        Front functions must be published to the LIVE stage to
                        associate them with a cache behavior.

                        (structure)
                            A  CloudFront  function  that is associated with a
                            cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution.

                            FunctionARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

                            EventType -> (string)
                               The   event   type   of  the  function,  either
                               viewer-request or viewer-response . You  cannot
                               use  origin-facing  event types (origin-request
                               and origin-response ) with a  CloudFront  func-
                               tion.

                 FieldLevelEncryptionId -> (string)
                     The value of ID for the field-level encryption configura-
                     tion that you want CloudFront to use for encrypting  spe-
                     cific fields of data for the default cache behavior.

                 RealtimeLogConfigArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log con-
                     figuration that is attached to this cache  behavior.  For
                     more information, see Real-time logs in the Amazon Cloud-
                     Front Developer Guide .

                 CachePolicyId -> (string)
                     The  unique  identifier  of  the  cache  policy  that  is
                     attached to the default cache behavior. For more informa-
                     tion, see Creating cache policies or  Using  the  managed
                     cache policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     A DefaultCacheBehavior must include either  a  CachePoli-
                     cyId  or  ForwardedValues  .  We recommend that you use a
                     CachePolicyId .

                 OriginRequestPolicyId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier of the origin request  policy  that
                     is  attached  to  the  default  cache  behavior. For more
                     information, see  Creating  origin  request  policies  or

                     CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 ResponseHeadersPolicyId -> (string)
                     The identifier for a response headers policy.

                 ForwardedValues -> (structure)
                     This field is deprecated. We recommend  that  you  use  a
                     cache  policy or an origin request policy instead of this
                     field. For more information, see Working with policies in
                     the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     If  you  want  to  include values in the cache key, use a
                     cache policy. For more information,  see  Creating  cache
                     policies  or Using the managed cache policies in the Ama-
                     zon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     If you want to send values to the origin but not  include
                     them  in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For
                     more information, see Creating origin request policies or
                     Using  the  managed origin request policies in the Amazon
                     CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     A DefaultCacheBehavior must include either  a  CachePoli-
                     cyId  or  ForwardedValues  .  We recommend that you use a
                     CachePolicyId .

                     A complex type  that  specifies  how  CloudFront  handles
                     query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                     QueryString -> (boolean)
                        This  field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a
                        cache policy or an origin request  policy  instead  of
                        this field.

                        If you want to include query strings in the cache key,
                        use a cache policy. For more information, see Creating
                        cache  policies  in  the  Amazon  CloudFront Developer
                        Guide .

                        If you want to send query strings to  the  origin  but
                        not  include  them  in  the  cache  key, use an origin
                        request policy. For  more  information,  see  Creating
                        origin  request  policies  in  the  Amazon  CloudFront
                        Developer Guide .

                        Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query
                        strings  to  the  origin  that is associated with this
                        cache behavior and cache based  on  the  query  string
                        parameters.  CloudFront  behavior depends on the value
                        of QueryString and on the values that you specify  for
                        QueryStringCacheKeys , if any:

                        If  you  specify  true  for  QueryString and you don't
                        specify any values for QueryStringCacheKeys  ,  Cloud-
                        Front forwards all query string parameters to the ori-
                        gin and caches based on all query  string  parameters.
                        Depending on how many query string parameters and val-
                        ues you have, this can  adversely  affect  performance
                        because  CloudFront  must forward more requests to the
                        origin.

                        If you specify true for QueryString  and  you  specify
                        one  or  more values for QueryStringCacheKeys , Cloud-
                        Front forwards all query string parameters to the ori-
                        gin,  but  it  only  caches  based on the query string
                        parameters that you specify.

                        If you specify  false  for  QueryString  ,  CloudFront
                        doesn't  forward  any  query  string parameters to the
                        origin, and doesn't cache based on query string param-

                        this field.

                        If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a

                 A  complex type that contains zero or more CacheBehavior ele-
                 ments.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of cache behaviors for this distribution.

                 Items -> (list)
                     Optional: A complex type that  contains  cache  behaviors
                     for  this  distribution.  If Quantity is 0 , you can omit
                     Items .

                     (structure)
                        A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes
                        requests.

                        You  must  create  at  least  as  many cache behaviors
                        (including the default cache  behavior)  as  you  have
                        origins  if  you want CloudFront to serve objects from
                        all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies  the
                        one  origin  from  which  you  want  CloudFront to get
                        objects. If you have two origins and only the  default
                        cache  behavior, the default cache behavior will cause
                        CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but
                        the other origin is never used.

                        For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the
                        number of cache behaviors that you can add to  a  dis-
                        tribution,  see Quotas in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
                        oper Guide .

                        If you dont  want  to  specify  any  cache  behaviors,
                        include  only  an  empty  CacheBehaviors element. Dont
                        include an empty CacheBehavior element because this is
                        invalid.

                        To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribu-
                        tion,  update  the  distribution   configuration   and
                        include only an empty CacheBehaviors element.

                        To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors,
                        update the distribution configuration and specify  all
                        of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the
                        updated distribution.

                        For more information about cache behaviors, see  Cache
                        Behavior  Settings  in the Amazon CloudFront Developer
                        Guide .

                        PathPattern -> (string)
                            The pattern  (for  example,  images/*.jpg  )  that
                            specifies which requests to apply the behavior to.
                            When CloudFront receives  a  viewer  request,  the
                            requested  path  is compared with path patterns in
                            the order in which cache behaviors are  listed  in
                            the distribution.

                            NOTE:
                               You  can optionally include a slash (/ ) at the
                               beginning of the  path  pattern.  For  example,
                               /images/*.jpg . CloudFront behavior is the same
                               with or without the leading / .

                            The path pattern for the default cache behavior is
                            *  and  cannot  be  changed. If the request for an
                            object does not match the  path  pattern  for  any
                            cache  behaviors,  CloudFront applies the behavior
                            in the default cache behavior.

                            The  value  of  ID  for  the  origin that you want
                            CloudFront to route requests to  when  they  match

                            WARNING:
                               We  recommend using TrustedKeyGroups instead of
                               TrustedSigners .

                            A list of Amazon Web Services  account  IDs  whose
                            public  keys CloudFront can use to validate signed
                            URLs or signed cookies.

                            When a cache behavior  contains  trusted  signers,
                            CloudFront  requires signed URLs or signed cookies
                            for all requests that match  the  cache  behavior.
                            The  URLs  or cookies must be signed with the pri-
                            vate key of a CloudFront key pair in  the  trusted
                            signers  Amazon  Web  Services account. The signed
                            URL or cookie  contains  information  about  which
                            public  key  CloudFront  should  use to verify the
                            signature. For more information, see Serving  pri-

                               signed  URLs  and  signed cookies. If not, this
                               field is false .

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of Amazon Web Services  accounts  in

                        TrustedKeyGroups -> (structure)
                            A list of key groups that CloudFront  can  use  to
                            validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                            When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups,
                            CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed  cookies
                            for  all  requests  that match the cache behavior.
                            The URLs or cookies must be signed with a  private
                            key  whose  corresponding public key is in the key
                            group. The signed URL or cookie contains  informa-
                            tion  about which public key CloudFront should use
                            to verify the signature. For more information, see

                        ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                            The  protocol  that  viewers can use to access the
                            files in the origin  specified  by  TargetOriginId
                            when  a  request matches the path pattern in Path-
                            Pattern . You can specify the following options:

                            o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                            o redirect-to-https : If a viewer submits an  HTTP
                              request,  CloudFront returns an HTTP status code
                              of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the  viewer  along
                              with  the  HTTPS  URL. The viewer then resubmits
                              the request using the new URL.

                            o https-only : If a viewer sends an HTTP  request,
                              CloudFront  returns  an  HTTP status code of 403
                              (Forbidden).

                            For more information  about  requiring  the  HTTPS
                            protocol,  see Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and
                            CloudFront  in  the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
                            Guide .

                            NOTE:
                               The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve
                               an object that  was  fetched  from  the  origin
                               using  HTTPS is never to use any other protocol
                               to fetch  the  object.  If  you  have  recently
                               changed  from  HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that
                               you clear your  objects  cache  because  cached
                               objects  are protocol agnostic. That means that
                               an edge location will return an object from the
                               cache regardless of whether the current request
                               protocol matches the protocol used  previously.

                        AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                            A  complex  type  that controls which HTTP methods
                            CloudFront processes and forwards to  your  Amazon
                            S3  bucket  or your custom origin. There are three
                            choices:

                            o CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD  requests.

                            o CloudFront  forwards  only  GET  ,  HEAD  ,  and
                              OPTIONS requests.

                            o CloudFront forwards  GET,  HEAD,  OPTIONS,  PUT,
                              PATCH, POST , and DELETE requests.

                            If  you  pick  the  third  choice, you may need to
                            restrict access to your Amazon  S3  bucket  or  to
                            your  custom  origin so users can't perform opera-
                            tions that you don't want them  to.  For  example,
                            you  might  not  want users to have permissions to
                            delete objects from your origin.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of HTTP methods that you want Cloud-
                               Front  to  forward to your origin. Valid values
                               are 2 (for GET and HEAD requests), 3 (for GET ,
                               HEAD  ,  and  OPTIONS requests) and 7 (for GET,
                               HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST  ,  and  DELETE
                               requests).

                            Items -> (list)
                               A  complex  type that contains the HTTP methods
                               that you want CloudFront to process and forward
                               to your origin.

                               (string)

                            CachedMethods -> (structure)
                               A complex type that controls whether CloudFront
                               caches the response to requests using the spec-
                               ified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                               o CloudFront  caches  responses to GET and HEAD
                                 requests.

                               o CloudFront caches responses to GET ,  HEAD  ,
                                 and OPTIONS requests.

                               If  you  pick the second choice for your Amazon
                               S3 Origin, you may need to forward  Access-Con-
                               trol-Request-Method,                Access-Con-
                               trol-Request-Headers, and  Origin  headers  for
                               the responses to be cached correctly.

                               Quantity -> (integer)
                                   The  number  of  HTTP methods for which you
                                   want CloudFront to cache  responses.  Valid
                                   values  are 2 (for caching responses to GET
                                   and  HEAD  requests)  and  3  (for  caching
                                   responses  to  GET  ,  HEAD  ,  and OPTIONS
                                   requests).

                               Items -> (list)
                                   A complex type that contains the HTTP meth-
                                   ods  that  you  want  CloudFront  to  cache
                                   responses to.

                                   (string)

                        SmoothStreaming -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether you  want  to  distribute  media
                            files  in  the  Microsoft  Smooth Streaming format
                            using the origin  that  is  associated  with  this
                            cache  behavior.  If  so,  specify  true ; if not,
                            specify false . If you specify  true  for  Smooth-
                            Streaming , you can still distribute other content
                            using this cache behavior if the  content  matches
                            the value of PathPattern .

                        Compress -> (boolean)
                            Whether  you want CloudFront to automatically com-
                            press certain files for this  cache  behavior.  If
                            so,  specify true; if not, specify false. For more

                            Lambda@Edge  function  associations  for  a  cache
                            behavior.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of Lambda@Edge function associations
                               for this cache behavior.

                            Items -> (list)
                                   Optional : A  complex  type  that  contains
                                   LambdaFunctionAssociation  items  for  this
                                   cache behavior. If Quantity is 0 , you  can
                                   omit Items .

                               (structure)
                                   A  complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge
                                   function association.

                                   LambdaFunctionARN -> (string)
                                      The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You
                                      must  specify the ARN of a function ver-
                                      sion; you  can't  specify  an  alias  or
                                      $LATEST.

                                   EventType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the event type that triggers a
                                      Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can
                                      specify the following values:

                                      o viewer-request : The function executes
                                        when  CloudFront  receives  a  request
                                        from  a viewer and before it checks to
                                        see whether the requested object is in
                                        the edge cache.

                                      o origin-request : The function executes
                                        only when CloudFront sends  a  request
                                        to  your  origin.  When  the requested
                                        object is in the edge cache, the func-
                                        tion doesn't execute.

                                      o origin-response  :  The  function exe-
                                        cutes  after  CloudFront  receives   a
                                        response from the origin and before it
                                        caches the  object  in  the  response.

                               but not include them in the cache key,  use  an
                               origin  request  policy.  For more information,

                               Indicates  whether  you want CloudFront to for-
                               ward query strings to the origin that is  asso-
                               ciated with this cache behavior and cache based
                               on  the  query  string  parameters.  CloudFront
                               behavior  depends  on  the value of QueryString
                               and on the values that you specify for  QueryS-
                               tringCacheKeys , if any:

                               If  you  specify  true  for QueryString and you
                               don't  specify  any  values  for   QueryString-
                               CacheKeys   ,  CloudFront  forwards  all  query
                               string parameters  to  the  origin  and  caches
                               based on all query string parameters. Depending
                               on how many query string parameters and  values
                               you have, this can adversely affect performance
                               because CloudFront must forward  more  requests
                               to the origin.

                               If  you  specify  true  for QueryString and you
                               specify one or  more  values  for  QueryString-
                               CacheKeys   ,  CloudFront  forwards  all  query
                               string parameters to the origin,  but  it  only
                               caches  based  on  the  query string parameters
                               that you specify.

                               If you specify false for QueryString  ,  Cloud-
                               Front  doesn't forward any query string parame-
                               ters to the origin, and doesn't cache based  on
                               query string parameters.

                            The HTTP status code for which you want to specify
                            a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                        ResponsePagePath -> (string)
                            The path to the custom error page  that  you  want
                            CloudFront  to return to a viewer when your origin
                            returns the HTTP status code specified  by  Error-
                            Code , for example, /4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html
                            . If you want to store your objects and your  cus-
                            tom  error pages in different locations, your dis-
                            tribution must include a cache behavior for  which
                            the following is true:

                            o The  value  of  PathPattern  matches the path to
                              your custom error messages. For example, suppose
                              you  saved  custom error pages for 4xx errors in
                              an  Amazon  S3  bucket  in  a  directory   named
                              /4xx-errors  .  Your distribution must include a
                              cache behavior for which the path pattern routes
                              requests  for  your  custom  error pages to that
                              location, for example, /4xx-errors/* .

                            o The value of TargetOriginId specifies the  value
                              of  the  ID element for the origin that contains
                              your custom error pages.

                            If you specify a value for ResponsePagePath ,  you
                            must also specify a value for ResponseCode .

                            We  recommend that you store custom error pages in
                            an Amazon S3 bucket. If  you  store  custom  error
                            pages  on  an HTTP server and the server starts to
                            return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the  files
                            that  you  want  to  return to viewers because the
                            origin server is unavailable.

                        ResponseCode -> (string)
                            The HTTP status code that you want  CloudFront  to
                            return  to  the viewer along with the custom error
                            page. There are a  variety  of  reasons  that  you
                            might want CloudFront to return a status code dif-
                            ferent from  the  status  code  that  your  origin
                            returned to CloudFront, for example:

                            o Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corpo-
                              rate proxies, for example)  intercept  HTTP  4xx
                              and  5xx  and  prevent  the  response from being
                              returned to the viewer. If you substitute 200  ,
                              the response typically won't be intercepted.

                            o If  you  don't  care  about distinguishing among
                              different client errors or  server  errors,  you
                              can  specify  400 or 500 as the ResponseCode for
                              all 4xx or 5xx errors.

                            o You might want to return a 200 status code  (OK)
                              and  static website so your customers don't know
                              that your website is down.

                            If you specify a value for ResponseCode , you must
                            also specify a value for ResponsePagePath .

                        ErrorCachingMinTTL -> (long)
                            The  minimum  amount of time, in seconds, that you
                            want CloudFront to  cache  the  HTTP  status  code
                            specified in ErrorCode . When this time period has
                            elapsed, CloudFront queries  your  origin  to  see
                            whether the problem that caused the error has been
                            resolved and the requested object  is  now  avail-
                            able.

                            For   more   information,  see  Customizing  Error
                            Responses in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide
                            .

              Comment -> (string)
                 An optional comment to describe the distribution. The comment
                 cannot be longer than 128 characters.

              Logging -> (structure)
                 A complex type that controls whether access logs are  written
                 for the distribution.

                 For  more  information  about logging, see Access Logs in the
                 Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs
                     to  an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable log-
                     ging when you create a distribution or  if  you  want  to
                     disable  logging  for  an  existing distribution, specify
                     false for Enabled , and specify empty Bucket  and  Prefix
                     elements.  If you specify false for Enabled but you spec-
                     ify values for Bucket , prefix , and IncludeCookies , the
                     values are automatically deleted.

                 IncludeCookies -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether you want CloudFront to include cookies
                     in access logs, specify true for IncludeCookies . If  you
                     choose  to  include  cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all
                     cookies regardless of how you configure the cache  behav-
                     iors  for this distribution. If you don't want to include
                     cookies when you create a distribution or if you want  to
                     disable  include  cookies  for  an existing distribution,
                     specify false for IncludeCookies .

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 bucket to store the  access  logs  in,  for
                     example, myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An  optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to
                     the access log filenames for this distribution, for exam-
                     ple,  myprefix/  . If you want to enable logging, but you
                     don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an
                     empty Prefix element in the Logging element.

              PriceClass -> (string)
                 The  price class that corresponds with the maximum price that
                 you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify Price-
                 Class_All  , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects
                 from all CloudFront edge locations.

                 If you specify a price  class  other  than  PriceClass_All  ,
                 CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge loca-
                 tion that has the lowest latency among the edge locations  in
                 your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are
                 excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower
                 performance.

                 For  more  information  about price classes, see Choosing the
                 Price Class for  a  CloudFront  Distribution  in  the  Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide . For information about CloudFront
                 pricing, including how price classes  (such  as  Price  Class
                 100) map to CloudFront regions, see Amazon CloudFront Pricing
                 .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 From this field, you can enable or disable the selected  dis-
                 tribution.

              ViewerCertificate -> (structure)
                 A complex type that determines the distributions SSL/TLS con-
                 figuration for communicating with viewers.

                 CloudFrontDefaultCertificate -> (boolean)
                     If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name  such
                     as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net , set this field to true
                     .

                     If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names
                     or  CNAMEs),  set  this field to false and specify values
                     for the following fields:

                     o ACMCertificateArn or IAMCertificateId (specify a  value
                       for one, not both)

                     o MinimumProtocolVersion

                     o SSLSupportMethod

                 IAMCertificateId -> (string)
                     If  the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names
                     or CNAMEs) and  the  SSL/TLS  certificate  is  stored  in
                     Identity  and Access Management (IAM) , provide the ID of
                     the IAM certificate.

                     If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also spec-
                     ify  values  for  MinimumProtocolVersion  and SSLSupport-
                     Method .

                 ACMCertificateArn -> (string)
                     If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names
                     or  CNAMEs)  and  the  SSL/TLS  certificate  is stored in
                     Certificate Manager (ACM) , provide the  Amazon  Resource
                     Name  (ARN)  of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only sup-
                     ports ACM certificates  in  the  US  East  (N.  Virginia)
                     Region (us-east-1 ).

                     If  you  specify  an  ACM  certificate ARN, you must also
                     specify values for MinimumProtocolVersion and SSLSupport-
                     Method .

                 SSLSupportMethod -> (string)
                     If  the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names
                     or  CNAMEs),  specify  which  viewers  the   distribution
                     accepts HTTPS connections from.

                     o sni-only   The  distribution  accepts HTTPS connections
                       from only viewers that support server  name  indication
                       (SNI)  . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients
                       support SNI.

                     o vip  The distribution accepts  HTTPS  connections  from
                       all viewers including those that dont support SNI. This
                       is not recommended, and results in  additional  monthly
                       charges from CloudFront.

                     o static-ip  - Do not specify this value unless your dis-
                       tribution has been enabled  for  this  feature  by  the
                       CloudFront  team.  If you have a use case that requires
                       static IP addresses for a distribution, contact  Cloud-
                       Front  through the Amazon Web Services Support Center .

                     If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name  such
                     as  d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net  , dont set a value for
                     this field.

                 MinimumProtocolVersion -> (string)
                     If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names
                     or  CNAMEs),  specify  the  security policy that you want
                     CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The
                     security policy determines two settings:

                     o The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to
                       communicate with viewers.

                     o The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the con-
                       tent that it returns to viewers.

                     For  more  information, see Security Policy and Supported
                     Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and  CloudFront  in
                     the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        On  the  CloudFront  console,  this  setting is called
                        Security Policy .

                     When youre using SNI only (you  set  SSLSupportMethod  to
                     sni-only ), you must specify TLSv1 or higher.

                     If  the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such
                     as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net (you  set  CloudFrontDe-
                     faultCertificate to true ), CloudFront automatically sets
                     the security policy to TLSv1 regardless of the value that
                     you set here.

                 Certificate -> (string)
                     This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields
                     instead:

                     o ACMCertificateArn

                     o IAMCertificateId

                     o CloudFrontDefaultCertificate

                 CertificateSource -> (string)
                     This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields
                     instead:

                     o ACMCertificateArn

                     o IAMCertificateId

                     o CloudFrontDefaultCertificate

              Restrictions -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type  that  identifies  ways in which you want to
                 restrict distribution of your content.

                 GeoRestriction -> (structure)
                     A complex type that controls the countries in which  your
                     content  is  distributed. CloudFront determines the loca-
                     tion of your users using MaxMind GeoIP databases.

                     RestrictionType -> (string)
                        The method that you want to use to restrict  distribu-
                        tion of your content by country:

                        o none : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access
                          to content is not restricted by client geo location.

                        o blacklist  : The Location elements specify the coun-
                          tries in which you don't want CloudFront to distrib-
                          ute your content.

                        o whitelist  : The Location elements specify the coun-
                          tries in which you  want  CloudFront  to  distribute
                          your content.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        When  geo  restriction is enabled , this is the number
                        of countries in your whitelist or blacklist  .  Other-
                        wise,  when it is not enabled, Quantity is 0 , and you
                        can omit Items .

                     Items -> (list)
                        A complex type that contains a  Location  element  for
                        each  country  in  which you want CloudFront either to
                        distribute your content (whitelist ) or not distribute
                        your content (blacklist ).

                        The  Location element is a two-letter, uppercase coun-
                        try code for a country that you  want  to  include  in
                        your  blacklist  or  whitelist  . Include one Location
                        element for each country.

                        CloudFront and  MaxMind  both  use  ISO  3166  country
                        codes.  For the current list of countries and the cor-
                        responding codes, see ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code  on  the
                        International  Organization  for  Standardization web-
                        site. You can also refer to the country  list  on  the
                        CloudFront  console, which includes both country names
                        and codes.

                        (string)

              WebACLId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL,  if  any,
                 to  associate  with  this  distribution. To specify a web ACL
                 created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for
                 example
                 arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWe-
                 bACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a  . To specify a web
                 ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL  ID,  for  example
                 473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a .

                 WAF  is  a web application firewall that lets you monitor the
                 HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and
                 lets  you control access to your content. Based on conditions
                 that you specify, such as  the  IP  addresses  that  requests
                 originate  from  or  the  values of query strings, CloudFront
                 responds to requests either with  the  requested  content  or
                 with  an  HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also con-
                 figure CloudFront to  return  a  custom  error  page  when  a
                 request  is  blocked. For more information about WAF, see the
                 WAF Developer Guide .

              HttpVersion -> (string)
                 (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP  version  that  you  want
                 viewers  to  use  to communicate with CloudFront. The default
                 value for new web distributions is http2. Viewers that  don't
                 support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

                 For  viewers  and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must sup-
                 port TLS 1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Identifi-
                 cation (SNI).

                 In  general, configuring CloudFront to communicate with view-
                 ers using HTTP/2 reduces latency. You can improve performance
                 by  optimizing for HTTP/2. For more information, do an Inter-
                 net search for "http/2 optimization."

              IsIPV6Enabled -> (boolean)
                 If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS  requests  with
                 an  IPv6 address for your distribution, specify true . If you
                 specify false , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with
                 the  DNS response code NOERROR and with no IP addresses. This
                 allows viewers to  submit  a  second  request,  for  an  IPv4
                 address for your distribution.

                 In  general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6
                 networks who want to access your content. However, if  you're
                 using  signed  URLs  or  signed cookies to restrict access to
                 your content, and  if  you're  using  a  custom  policy  that
                 includes the IpAddress parameter to restrict the IP addresses
                 that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you  want
                 to  restrict  access  to  some  content by IP address and not
                 restrict access to other content (or restrict access but  not
                 by  IP  address),  you can create two distributions. For more
                 information, see Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom  Policy
                 in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 If  you're  using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration
                 alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront
                 distribution,  you  need  to  create  a second alias resource
                 record set when both of the following are true:

                 o You enable IPv6 for the distribution

                 o You're using alternate domain names in the  URLs  for  your
                   objects

                 If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route
                 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another  DNS  ser-
                 vice, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will
                 route traffic to  your  distribution  regardless  of  the  IP
                 address format of the viewer request.

              Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an
              Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want  to  serve
              content  publicly  on  an alternate domain name, also known as a
              CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront.  AliasICPRecordal  pro-
              vides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distri-
              butions.

                 Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for
                 an  Internet  Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to
                 serve content publicly on  an  alternate  domain  name,  also

                 sICPRecordal provides the  ICP  recordal  status  for  CNAMEs
                 associated  with distributions. The status is returned in the
                 CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

                 CNAME -> (string)
                     A domain name associated with a distribution.

                 ICPRecordalStatus -> (string)
                     The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a
                     CNAME.  The  ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all
                     CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China.

                     The status values returned are the following:

                     o APPROVED indicates that  the  associated  CNAME  has  a
                       valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be asso-
                       ciated with a distribution, and CNAMEs  can  correspond
                       to  different  ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED,
                       that is, valid to use with China region, a  CNAME  must
                       have one ICP recordal number associated with it.

                     o SUSPENDED  indicates that the associated CNAME does not
                       have a valid ICP recordal number.

                     o PENDING indicates that CloudFront can't  determine  the
                       ICP  recordal  status  of the CNAME associated with the
                       distribution because there was an error  in  trying  to
                       determine  the  status. You can try again to see if the
                       error is resolved in which case CloudFront  returns  an
                       APPROVED or SUSPENDED status.

       ETag -> (string)
          The   current   version   of   the   configuration.   For   example:
          E2QWRUHAPOMQZL .
