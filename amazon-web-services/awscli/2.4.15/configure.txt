CONFIGURE()                                                        CONFIGURE()



NAME
       configure -

DESCRIPTION
       Configure  AWS  CLI  options. If this command is run with no arguments,
       you will be prompted for configuration values such as your  AWS  Access
       Key  Id and your AWS Secret Access Key.  You can configure a named pro-
       file using the --profile argument.  If your config file does not  exist
       (the default location is ~/.aws/config), the AWS CLI will create it for
       you.  To keep an existing value, hit enter when prompted for the value.
       When  you  are prompted for information, the current value will be dis-
       played in [brackets].  If the config item has no value, it be displayed
       as [None].  Note that the configure command only works with values from
       the config file.  It does not use any configuration values  from  envi-
       ronment variables or the IAM role.

       Note:  the  values  you  provide  for the AWS Access Key ID and the AWS
       Secret Access Key will  be  written  to  the  shared  credentials  file
       (~/.aws/credentials).

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The following configuration variables are supported in the config file:

       o aws_access_key_id - The AWS access key part of your credentials

       o aws_secret_access_key - The AWS secret access key part of  your  cre-
         dentials

       o aws_session_token  - The session token part of your credentials (ses-
         sion tokens only)

       o metadata_service_timeout - The number of seconds to  wait  until  the
         metadata service request times out.  This is used if you are using an
         IAM role to provide your credentials.

       o metadata_service_num_attempts - The number  of  attempts  to  try  to
         retrieve  credentials.   If you know for certain you will be using an
         IAM role on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can set this value to  ensure
         any intermittent failures are retried.  By default this value is 1.

       For  more information on configuration options, see Configuring the AWS
       Command Line Interface in the AWS CLI User Guide.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
