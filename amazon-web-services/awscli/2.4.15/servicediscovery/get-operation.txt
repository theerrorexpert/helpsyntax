GET-OPERATION()                                                GET-OPERATION()



NAME
       get-operation -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  any operation that returns an operation ID in
       the response, such as a CreateService request.

       NOTE:
          To get a list of  operations  that  match  specified  criteria,  see
          ListOperations .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-operation
          --operation-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --operation-id (string)
          The ID of the operation that you want to get more information about.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the result of an operation

       The following get-operation example gets the result of an operation.

          aws servicediscovery get-operation \
              --operation-id gv4g5meo7ndmeh4fqskygvk23d2fijwa-k9302yzd

       Output:

          {

                      "NAMESPACE": "ns-ylexjili4cdxy3xm"
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Operation -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about the operation.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the operation that you want to get information  about.

          Type -> (string)
              The  name  of the operation that's associated with the specified
              ID.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the operation. Values include the following:
                 SUBMITTED

              This is the initial state that occurs immediately after you sub-
              mit a request.
                 PENDING

              Cloud Map is performing the operation.
                 SUCCESS

              The operation succeeded.
                 FAIL

              The operation failed. For the failure reason, see ErrorMessage .

          ErrorMessage -> (string)
              If the value of Status is FAIL , the reason that  the  operation
              failed.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              The  code  associated  with  ErrorMessage . Values for ErrorCode
              include the following:

              o ACCESS_DENIED

              o CANNOT_CREATE_HOSTED_ZONE

              o EXPIRED_TOKEN

              o HOSTED_ZONE_NOT_FOUND

              o INTERNAL_FAILURE

              o INVALID_CHANGE_BATCH

              o THROTTLED_REQUEST

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time  that  the  request  was  submitted,  in  Unix
              date/time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value
              of CreateDate is accurate  to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the
              value   1516925490.087   represents  Friday,  January  26,  2018

              The date and time that the value of Status changed to  the  cur-
              rent  value,  in Unix date/time format and Coordinated Universal
              Time (UTC). The value of UpdateDate is accurate to milliseconds.
              For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January
              26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

          Targets -> (map)
