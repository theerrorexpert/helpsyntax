LIST-SERVICES()                                                LIST-SERVICES()



NAME
       list-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists summary information for all the services that are associated with
       one or more specified namespaces.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-services is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Services

SYNOPSIS
            list-services
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          A  complex type that contains specifications for the namespaces that
          you want to list services for.

          If you specify more than one filter, an  operation  must  match  all
          filters to be returned by ListServices .

          (structure)
              A  complex  type  that  lets you specify the namespaces that you
              want to list services for.

              Name -> (string)
                 Specify NAMESPACE_ID .

              Values -> (list)
                 The values that are applicable to the value that you  specify
                 for Condition to filter the list of services.

                 (string)

              Condition -> (string)
                 The operator that you want to use to determine whether a ser-
                 vice is returned by ListServices . Valid values for Condition
                 include the following:

                 o EQ  :  When  you  specify EQ , specify one namespace ID for
                   Values . EQ is the default condition and can be omitted.

                 o IN : When you specify IN , specify a list of  the  IDs  for
                   the  namespaces that you want ListServices to return a list
                   of services for.

                 o BETWEEN : Not applicable.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "NAMESPACE_ID",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Condition": "EQ"|"IN"|"BETWEEN"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Services -> (list)
          An array that contains one ServiceSummary object  for  each  service
          that matches the specified filter criteria.

          (structure)
              A  complex type that contains information about a specified ser-
              vice.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID that Cloud Map assigned to the service when  you  cre-
                 ated it.

              Arn -> (string)

                 service when you create it.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the service.

              Type -> (string)
                 Describes the systems that can be used to discover  the  ser-
                 vice instances.
                     DNS_HTTP

                 The  service  instances  can  be  discovered using either DNS
                 queries or the DiscoverInstances API operation.
                     HTTP

                 The service instances can only be discovered using  the  Dis-
                 coverInstances API operation.
                     DNS

                 Reserved.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description that you specify when you create the service.

              InstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The number of instances that are  currently  associated  with
                 the  service.  Instances that were previously associated with
                 the service but that  are  deleted  aren't  included  in  the
                 count.  The count might not reflect pending registrations and
                 deregistrations.

              DnsConfig -> (structure)
                 Information about the Route 53  DNS  records  that  you  want
                 Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                 NamespaceId -> (string)
                     The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

                 RoutingPolicy -> (string)
                     The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53
                     DNS records that Cloud Map creates when you  register  an
                     instance and specify this service.

                     NOTE:
                        If  you want to use this service to register instances
                        that create alias records, specify  WEIGHTED  for  the
                        routing policy.

                     You can specify the following values:
                        MULTIVALUE

                     If  you  define  a  health  check for the service and the
                     health check is healthy, Route 53 returns the  applicable
                     value for up to eight instances.

                     For example, suppose that the service includes configura-
                     tions for one A record and a health check.  You  use  the
                     service  to  register  10 instances. Route 53 responds to
                     DNS queries with IP addresses for  up  to  eight  healthy
                     instances.  If  fewer  than  eight instances are healthy,
                     Route  53  responds  to  every  DNS  query  with  the  IP
                     addresses for all of the healthy instances.

                     If you don't define a health check for the service, Route
                     53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the
                     values for up to eight instances.

                     For more information about the multivalue routing policy,
                     see Multivalue Answer Routing in the Route  53  Developer
                     Guide .
                        WEIGHTED

                     Route  53  returns the applicable value from one randomly
                     selected instance from among the instances that you  reg-
                     istered  using  the  same service. Currently, all records
                     have the same weight, so you can't  route  more  or  less
                     traffic to any instances.

                     For example, suppose that the service includes configura-
                     tions for one A record and a health check.  You  use  the
                     service  to  register  10 instances. Route 53 responds to
                     DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected
                     instance   from   among  the  healthy  instances.  If  no
                     instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to  DNS  queries
                     as if all of the instances were healthy.

                     If you don't define a health check for the service, Route
                     53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the
                     applicable value for one randomly selected instance.

                     For  more  information about the weighted routing policy,
                     see Weighted Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

                 DnsRecords -> (list)
                     An array that contains  one  DnsRecord  object  for  each
                     Route  53  DNS  record  that you want Cloud Map to create
                     when you register an instance.

                     (structure)
                        A complex type that  contains  information  about  the
                        Route 53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create
                        when you register an instance.

                        Type -> (string)
                            The type of the resource, which indicates the type
                            of  value that Route 53 returns in response to DNS
                            queries. You can specify values for  Type  in  the
                            following combinations:

                            o
                              **
                              A **

                            o
                              **
                              AAAA **

                            o
                              **
                              A ** and ** AAAA **

                            o
                              **
                              SRV **

                            o
                              **
                              CNAME **

                            If  you  want Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias
                            record when you register an instance, specify A or
                            AAAA for Type .

                            You specify other settings, such as the IP address
                            for A and  AAAA  records,  when  you  register  an
                            instance.     For     more     information,    see
                            RegisterInstance .

                            The following values are supported:
                               A

                            Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in
                            IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
                               AAAA

                            Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in
                            IPv6           format,           such           as
                            2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
                               CNAME

                            Route  53 returns the domain name of the resource,
                            such as www.example.com. Note the following:

                            o You specify the domain name  that  you  want  to
                              route  traffic to when you register an instance.
                              For more  information,  see  Attributes  in  the
                              topic RegisterInstance .

                            o You must specify WEIGHTED for the value of Rout-
                              ingPolicy .

                            o You can't specify both CNAME for Type  and  set-
                              tings  for  HealthCheckConfig  .  If you do, the
                              request will fail with an InvalidInput error.

                              SRV

                            Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record.  The
                            value for an SRV record uses the following values:
                               priority weight port service-hostname

                            Note the following about the values:

                            o The values of priority and weight are  both  set
                              to 1 and can't be changed.

                            o The  value of port comes from the value that you
                              specify for the AWS_INSTANCE_PORT attribute when
                              you submit a RegisterInstance request.

                            o The value of service-hostname is a concatenation
                              of the following values:

                              o The value that you specify for InstanceId when
                                you register an instance.

                              o The name of the service.

                              o The name of the namespace.

                            For  example, if the value of InstanceId is test ,
                            the name of the service is backend , and the  name
                            of  the  namespace  is  example.com , the value of
                            service-hostname is the following:
                               test.backend.example.com

                            If you specify settings for an  SRV  record,  note
                            the following:

                            o If  you  specify  values for AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4 ,
                              AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6 , or both in  the  RegisterIn-
                              stance  request, Cloud Map automatically creates
                              A and/or AAAA records that have the same name as
                              the value of service-hostname in the SRV record.
                              You can ignore these records.

                            o If you're using a system that  requires  a  spe-
                              cific  SRV format, such as HAProxy, see the Name
                              element in the documentation about CreateService
                              for information about how to specify the correct
                              name format.

                        TTL -> (long)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, that you want  DNS
                            resolvers to cache the settings for this record.

                            NOTE:
                               Alias records don't include a TTL because Route
                               53 uses the TTL for  the  Amazon  Web  Services
                               resource  that  an  alias record routes traffic
                               to.  If  you  include  the   AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME
                               attribute  when  you  submit a RegisterInstance
                               request, the TTL value is ignored. Always spec-
                               ify  a  TTL for the service; you can use a ser-
                               vice to register instances that  create  either
                               alias or non-alias records.

              HealthCheckConfig -> (structure)
                     Public  DNS  and  HTTP  namespaces  only. Settings for an
                     optional health check. If  you  specify  settings  for  a
                     health  check, Cloud Map associates the health check with
                     the records that you specify in DnsConfig .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of health check that you want to  create,  which
                     indicates  how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is
                     healthy.

                     WARNING:
                        You can't change the value of Type after you create  a
                        health check.

                     You can create the following types of health checks:

                     o HTTP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
                       successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and  waits
                       for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than
                       400.

                     o HTTPS : Route 53 tries to establish a  TCP  connection.
                       If  successful,  Route  53 submits an HTTPS request and
                       waits for an HTTP status code of  200  or  greater  and
                       less than 400.

                     WARNING:
                        If  you specify HTTPS for the value of Type , the end-
                        point must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                     o TCP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.  If
                       you  specify  TCP  for Type , don't specify a value for
                       ResourcePath .

                     For more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether
                     an  Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

                 ResourcePath -> (string)
                     The path that you want Route 53 to request when  perform-
                     ing  health  checks.  The path can be any value that your
                     endpoint returns an HTTP status code of a 2xx or 3xx for-
                     mat  for when the endpoint is healthy. An example file is
                     /docs/route53-health-check.html . Route 53  automatically
                     adds the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a
                     value for ResourcePath , the default value is / .

                     If you specify TCP for Type ,  you  must  not  specify  a
                     value for ResourcePath .

                 FailureThreshold -> (integer)
                     The  number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint
                     must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current sta-
                     tus  of  the  endpoint  from  unhealthy to healthy or the
                     other way around. For more information, see How Route  53
                     Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53
                     Developer Guide .

              HealthCheckCustomConfig -> (structure)
                 Information about an optional custom health check.  A  custom
                 health  check,  which  requires  that  you  use a third-party
                 health checker to evaluate the health of your  resources,  is
                 useful in the following circumstances:

                 o You can't use a health check that's defined by HealthCheck-
                   Config because the resource isn't available over the inter-
                   net.  For  example,  you can use a custom health check when
                   the instance is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the  health  of
                   resources  in a VPC, the health checker must also be in the
                   VPC.)

                 o You want to use a third-party health checker regardless  of
                   where your resources are located.

                 WARNING:
                     If  you  specify  a  health  check configuration, you can
                     specify either HealthCheckCustomConfig or HealthCheckCon-
                     fig but not both.

                 FailureThreshold -> (integer)

                     WARNING:
                        This  parameter  is  no longer supported and is always
                        set to 1. Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds
                        after  receiving  an  UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus
                        request before changing  the  status  of  the  service
                        instance.

                     The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map
                     to wait after receiving an UpdateInstanceCustomHealthSta-
                     tus request before it changes the health status of a ser-
                     vice instance.

                     Sending  a  second   or   subsequent   UpdateInstanceCus-
                     tomHealthStatus  request  with  the  same value before 30
                     seconds has passed doesn't accelerate the  change.  Cloud
                     Map  still  waits  30  seconds after the first request to
                     make the change.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the service was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response contains NextToken  ,  submit  another  ListServices
          request to get the next group of results. Specify the value of Next-
          Token from the previous response in the next request.

          NOTE:
              Cloud Map gets MaxResults services and then filters  them  based
              on the specified criteria. It's possible that no services in the
              first MaxResults services matched  the  specified  criteria  but
              that  subsequent  groups  of MaxResults services do contain ser-
              vices that match the criteria.
