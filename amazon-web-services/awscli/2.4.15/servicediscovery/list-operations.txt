LIST-OPERATIONS()                                            LIST-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists operations that match the criteria that you specify.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-operations  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Operations

SYNOPSIS
            list-operations
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          A complex type that contains specifications for the operations  that
          you want to list, for example, operations that you started between a
          specified start date and end date.

          If you specify more than one filter, an  operation  must  match  all
          filters to be returned by ListOperations .

          (structure)
              A complex type that lets you select the operations that you want
              to list.

              Name -> (string)
                 Specify the operations that you want to get:

                 o NAMESPACE_ID : Gets operations related to specified  names-
                   paces.

                 o SERVICE_ID : Gets operations related to specified services.

                 o STATUS : Gets operations based on the status of the  opera-
                   tions: SUBMITTED , PENDING , SUCCEED , or FAIL .

                 o TYPE : Gets specified types of operation.

                 o UPDATE_DATE  : Gets operations that changed status during a
                   specified date/time range.

              Values -> (list)
                 Specify values that are applicable  to  the  value  that  you
                 specify for Name :

                 o NAMESPACE_ID : Specify one namespace ID.

                 o SERVICE_ID : Specify one service ID.

                 o STATUS  : Specify one or more statuses: SUBMITTED , PENDING
                   , SUCCEED , or FAIL .

                 o TYPE : Specify one or more of  the  following  types:  CRE-
                   ATE_NAMESPACE  , DELETE_NAMESPACE , UPDATE_SERVICE , REGIS-
                   TER_INSTANCE , or DEREGISTER_INSTANCE .

                 o UPDATE_DATE : Specify a start date and an end date in  Unix
                   date/time  format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The
                   start date must be the first value.

                 (string)

              Condition -> (string)
                 The operator that you want to use  to  determine  whether  an
                 operation  matches the specified value. Valid values for con-
                 dition include:

                 o EQ : When you specify EQ for the condition, you can specify
                   only  one  value.  EQ  is supported for NAMESPACE_ID , SER-
                   VICE_ID , STATUS , and TYPE . EQ is the  default  condition
                   and can be omitted.

                 o IN : When you specify IN for the condition, you can specify
                   a list of one or more values. IN is  supported  for  STATUS
                   and  TYPE  .  An  operation must match one of the specified
                   values to be returned in the response.

                 o BETWEEN : Specify a start date and  an  end  date  in  Unix
                   date/time  format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The
                   start date must be the first value.  BETWEEN  is  supported
                   for UPDATE_DATE .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "NAMESPACE_ID"|"SERVICE_ID"|"STATUS"|"TYPE"|"UPDATE_DATE",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Condition": "EQ"|"IN"|"BETWEEN"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Operations -> (list)
          Summary information about the operations that  match  the  specified
          criteria.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about an operation that
              matches the criteria that  you  specified  in  a  ListOperations
              request.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID for an operation.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the operation. Values include the following:

                 o SUBMITTED : This is the initial state immediately after you
                   submit a request.

                 o PENDING : Cloud Map is performing the operation.

                 o SUCCESS : The operation succeeded.

                 o FAIL : The operation failed. For the  failure  reason,  see
                   ErrorMessage .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response contains NextToken , submit another ListOperations
          request to get the next group of results. Specify the value of Next-
          Token from the previous response in the next request.

          NOTE:
              Cloud Map gets MaxResults operations and then filters them based
              on the specified criteria. It's possible that no  operations  in
              the  first  MaxResults operations matched the specified criteria
              but that subsequent groups of MaxResults operations  do  contain
              operations that match the criteria.
