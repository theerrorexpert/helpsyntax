GET-INSTANCES-HEALTH-STATUS()                    GET-INSTANCES-HEALTH-STATUS()



NAME
       get-instances-health-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  current health status (Healthy , Unhealthy , or Unknown ) of
       one or more instances that are associated with a specified service.

       NOTE:
          There's a brief delay between when you register an instance and when
          the health status for the instance is available.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-instances-health-status
          --service-id <value>
          [--instances <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-id (string)
          The ID of the service that the instance is associated with.

       --instances (list)
          An array that contains the IDs of all the instances that you want to
          get the health status for.

          If you omit Instances , Cloud Map returns the health status for  all
          the instances that are associated with the specified service.

          NOTE:
              To get the IDs for the instances that you've registered by using
              a specified service, submit a ListInstances request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of instances that you want Cloud Map to return in
          the  response  to  a  GetInstancesHealthStatus request. If you don't
          specify a value for  MaxResults  ,  Cloud  Map  returns  up  to  100
          instances.

       --next-token (string)
          For the first GetInstancesHealthStatus request, omit this value.

          If  more than MaxResults instances match the specified criteria, you
          can submit another GetInstancesHealthStatus request to get the  next
          group  of  results. Specify the value of NextToken from the previous
          response in the next request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (map)
          A complex type that contains the IDs and the health  status  of  the
          instances   that   you  specified  in  the  GetInstancesHealthStatus
          request.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If more than MaxResults instances match the specified criteria,  you
          can  submit another GetInstancesHealthStatus request to get the next
          group of results. Specify the value of NextToken from  the  previous
          response in the next request.
