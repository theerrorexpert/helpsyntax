DEREGISTER-INSTANCE()                                    DEREGISTER-INSTANCE()



NAME
       deregister-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the Amazon Route 53 DNS records and health check, if any, that
       Cloud Map created for the specified instance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-instance
          --service-id <value>
          --instance-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-id (string)
          The ID of the service that the instance is associated with.

       --instance-id (string)
          The value that you specified for Id in the RegisterInstance request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To deregister a service instance

       The   following   deregister-instance  example  deregisters  a  service
       instance.

          aws servicediscovery deregister-instance \
              --service-id srv-p5zdwlg5uvvzjita \
              --instance-id myservice-53

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "4yejorelbukcjzpnr6tlmrghsjwpngf4-k98rnaiq"
          }

       To confirm that the operation succeeded, you can run get-operation. For
       more information, see get-operation .

       For  more  information,  see Deregistering service instances in the AWS
       Cloud Map Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          A value that you can use to determine whether the request  completed
          successfully. To get the status of the operation, see GetOperation .
