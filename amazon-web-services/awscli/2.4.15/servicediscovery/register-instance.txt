REGISTER-INSTANCE()                                        REGISTER-INSTANCE()



NAME
       register-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  one  or  more  records and, optionally, creates a
       health check based on the settings in a  specified  service.  When  you
       submit a RegisterInstance request, the following occurs:

       o For  each  DNS record that you define in the service that's specified
         by ServiceId , a record is created or  updated  in  the  hosted  zone
         that's associated with the corresponding namespace.

       o If the service includes HealthCheckConfig , a health check is created
         based on the settings in the health check configuration.

       o The health check, if any, is associated  with  each  of  the  new  or
         updated records.

       WARNING:
          One  RegisterInstance  request  must  complete before you can submit
          another request and specify the same service ID and instance ID.

       For more information, see CreateService .

       When Cloud Map receives a DNS query for  the  specified  DNS  name,  it
       returns the applicable value:

       o If the health check is healthy : returns all the records

       o If  the  health check is unhealthy : returns the applicable value for
         the last healthy instance

       o If you didn't specify a health check configuration : returns all  the
         records

       For  the current quota on the number of instances that you can register
       using the same namespace and using the same service, see Cloud Map quo-
       tas in the Cloud Map Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            register-instance
          --service-id <value>
          --instance-id <value>
          [--creator-request-id <value>]
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  service  that you want to use for settings for the
          instance.

       --instance-id (string)
          An identifier that you want to associate with the instance. Note the
          following:

          o If the service that's specified by ServiceId includes settings for
            an SRV record, the value of InstanceId is  automatically  included
            as part of the value for the SRV record. For more information, see
            DnsRecord > Type .

          o You can use this value to update an existing instance.

          o To register a new instance, you must specify a value that's unique
            among instances that you register by using the same service.

          o If  you  specify  an existing InstanceId and ServiceId , Cloud Map
            updates the existing DNS records,  if  any.  If  there's  also  an
            existing  health check, Cloud Map deletes the old health check and
            creates a new one.

          NOTE:
              The health check isn't deleted immediately,  so  it  will  still
              appear for a while if you submit a ListHealthChecks request, for
              example.

       --creator-request-id (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and that  allows  failed
          RegisterInstance  requests to be retried without the risk of execut-
          ing the operation twice. You  must  use  a  unique  CreatorRequestId
          string  every  time  you submit a RegisterInstance request if you're
          registering additional instances for the same namespace and service.
          CreatorRequestId  can be any unique string (for example, a date/time
          stamp).

       --attributes (map)
          A string map that contains the following information for the service
          that you specify in ServiceId :

          o The  attributes  that apply to the records that are defined in the
            service.

          o For each attribute, the applicable value.

          Supported attribute keys include the following:
              AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME

          If you want Cloud Map to create an Amazon Route 53 alias record that
          routes  traffic  to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify
          the DNS name that's associated with the load balancer. For  informa-
          tion  about  how  to  get  the  DNS name, see "DNSName" in the topic
          AliasTarget in the Route 53 API Reference .

          Note the following:

          o The configuration for the service that's  specified  by  ServiceId
            must include settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both.

          o In  the service that's specified by ServiceId , the value of Rout-
            ingPolicy must be WEIGHTED .

          o If the service that's specified by ServiceId includes HealthCheck-
            Config  settings, Cloud Map will create the Route 53 health check,
            but it doesn't associate the health check with the alias record.

          o Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records  that
            route  traffic to Amazon Web Services resources other than Elastic
            Load Balancing load balancers.

          o If you specify a value for AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME , don't specify val-
            ues for any of the AWS_INSTANCE attributes.

            AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID
              HTTP  namespaces  only.  The  Amazon  EC2  instance  ID  for the
              instance. If the  AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID  attribute  is  specified,
              then   the  only  other  attribute  that  can  be  specified  is
              AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS . When the AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID  attribute
              is  specified,  then  the  AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4  attribute  will be
              filled out with the primary private IPv4 address.
                 AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS

          If the service configuration includes HealthCheckCustomConfig ,  you
          can  optionally  use  AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS  to specify the initial
          status of the custom health check, HEALTHY or  UNHEALTHY  .  If  you
          don't  specify a value for AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS , the initial sta-
          tus is HEALTHY .
              AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME

          If the service configuration includes a  CNAME  record,  the  domain
          name  that  you  want  Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries
          (for example, example.com ).

          This value  is  required  if  the  service  specified  by  ServiceId
          includes settings for an CNAME record.
              AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4

          If  the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 address
          that you want Route 53 to return in response  to  DNS  queries  (for
          example, 192.0.2.44 ).

          This  value  is  required  if  the  service  specified  by ServiceId
          includes settings for an A record. If the service includes  settings
          for  an SRV record, you must specify a value for AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4 ,
          AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6 , or both.
              AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6

          If the service configuration  includes  an  AAAA  record,  the  IPv6
          address  that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries
          (for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345 ).

          This value  is  required  if  the  service  specified  by  ServiceId
          includes  settings  for an AAAA record. If the service includes set-
          tings  for  an  SRV  record,  you   must   specify   a   value   for
          AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4 , AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6 , or both.
              AWS_INSTANCE_PORT

          If the service includes an SRV record, the value that you want Route
          53 to return for the port.

          If the service includes HealthCheckConfig , the port on the endpoint
          that you want Route 53 to send requests to.

          This  value  is required if you specified settings for an SRV record
          or a Route 53 health check when you created the service.
              Custom attributes

          You can add up to 30 custom attributes. For each key-value pair, the
          maximum length of the attribute name is 255 characters, and the max-
          imum length of the attribute value is 1,024  characters.  The  total
          size  of  all  provided attributes (sum of all keys and values) must
          not exceed 5,000 characters.
              key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To register a service instance

       The following register-instance example registers a service instance.

          aws servicediscovery register-instance \
              --service-id srv-p5zdwlg5uvvzjita \
              --instance-id myservice-53 \
              --attributes=AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4=172.2.1.3,AWS_INSTANCE_PORT=808

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "4yejorelbukcjzpnr6tlmrghsjwpngf4-k95yg2u7"
          }

       To confirm that the operation succeeded, you can run get-operation. For
       more information, see get-operation .

       For  more  information,  see Registering instances in the AWS Cloud Map
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          A value that you can use to determine whether the request  completed
          successfully. To get the status of the operation, see GetOperation .
