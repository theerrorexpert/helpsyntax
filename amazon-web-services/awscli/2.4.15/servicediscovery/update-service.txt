UPDATE-SERVICE()                                              UPDATE-SERVICE()



NAME
       update-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Submits a request to perform the following operations:

       o Update the TTL setting for existing DnsRecords configurations

       o Add, update, or delete HealthCheckConfig for a specified service

       NOTE:
          You  can't add, update, or delete a HealthCheckCustomConfig configu-
          ration.

       For public and private DNS namespaces, note the following:

       o If you omit any existing DnsRecords or  HealthCheckConfig  configura-
         tions  from  an UpdateService request, the configurations are deleted
         from the service.

       o If you omit an existing HealthCheckCustomConfig configuration from an
         UpdateService  request, the configuration isn't deleted from the ser-
         vice.

       When you update settings for a service, Cloud Map also updates the cor-
       responding settings in all the records and health checks that were cre-
       ated by using the specified service.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-service
          --id <value>
          --service <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the service that you want to update.

       --service (structure)
          A complex type that contains the new settings for the service.

          Description -> (string)
              A description for the service.

          DnsConfig -> (structure)
              Information about the Route 53 DNS records that you  want  Cloud
              Map to create when you register an instance.

              DnsRecords -> (list)
                 An array that contains one DnsRecord object for each Route 53
                 record that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an
                 instance.

                 (structure)
                     A  complex type that contains information about the Route
                     53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you
                     register an instance.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  type of the resource, which indicates the type of
                        value  that  Route  53  returns  in  response  to  DNS
                        queries.  You  can specify values for Type in the fol-
                        lowing combinations:

                        o
                          **
                          A **

                        o
                          **
                          AAAA **

                        o
                          **
                          A ** and ** AAAA **

                        o
                          **
                          SRV **

                        o
                          **
                          CNAME **

                        If you want Cloud Map  to  create  a  Route  53  alias
                        record  when  you  register  an instance, specify A or
                        AAAA for Type .

                        You specify other settings, such as the IP address for
                        A and AAAA records, when you register an instance. For
                        more information, see RegisterInstance .

                        The following values are supported:
                            A

                        Route 53 returns the IP address  of  the  resource  in
                        IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
                            AAAA

                        Route  53  returns  the  IP address of the resource in
                        IPv6            format,            such             as
                        2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
                            CNAME

                        Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such
                        as www.example.com. Note the following:

                        o You specify the domain name that you want  to  route
                          traffic  to  when you register an instance. For more
                          information,   see   Attributes   in    the    topic
                          RegisterInstance .

                        o You  must specify WEIGHTED for the value of Routing-
                          Policy .

                        o You can't specify both CNAME for Type  and  settings
                          for  HealthCheckConfig . If you do, the request will
                          fail with an InvalidInput error.

                          SRV

                        Route 53 returns the value  for  an  SRV  record.  The
                        value for an SRV record uses the following values:
                            priority weight port service-hostname

                        Note the following about the values:

                        o The  values of priority and weight are both set to 1
                          and can't be changed.

                        o The value of port comes  from  the  value  that  you
                          specify for the AWS_INSTANCE_PORT attribute when you
                          submit a RegisterInstance request.

                        o The value of service-hostname is a concatenation  of
                          the following values:

                          o The value that you specify for InstanceId when you
                            register an instance.

                          o The name of the service.

                          o The name of the namespace.

                        For example, if the value of InstanceId is test ,  the
                        name  of  the service is backend , and the name of the
                        namespace is example.com , the value of  service-host-
                        name is the following:
                            test.backend.example.com

                        If  you  specify  settings for an SRV record, note the
                        following:

                        o If  you  specify  values  for  AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4   ,
                          AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6  , or both in the RegisterInstance
                          request, Cloud Map automatically  creates  A  and/or
                          AAAA records that have the same name as the value of
                          service-hostname in the SRV record. You  can  ignore
                          these records.

                        o If  you're  using  a system that requires a specific
                          SRV format, such as HAProxy, see the Name element in
                          the  documentation  about CreateService for informa-
                          tion about how to specify the correct name format.

                     TTL -> (long)
                        The amount of time, in  seconds,  that  you  want  DNS
                        resolvers to cache the settings for this record.

                        NOTE:
                            Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53
                            uses the TTL for the Amazon Web Services  resource
                            that  an  alias  record  routes traffic to. If you
                            include the AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME attribute when  you
                            submit  a  RegisterInstance request, the TTL value
                            is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the  service;
                            you  can  use a service to register instances that
                            create either alias or non-alias records.

          HealthCheckConfig -> (structure)
                 Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only. Settings for an optional
                 health  check.  If  you  specify settings for a health check,
                 Cloud Map associates the health check with the  records  that
                 you specify in DnsConfig .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of health check that you want to create, which indi-
                 cates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

                 WARNING:
                     You  can't  change  the  value of Type after you create a
                     health check.

                 You can create the following types of health checks:

                 o HTTP : Route 53 tries to establish  a  TCP  connection.  If
                   successful,  Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 o HTTPS : Route 53 tries to establish a  TCP  connection.  If
                   successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 WARNING:
                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of Type , the endpoint
                     must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                 o TCP  : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you
                   specify TCP for Type , don't specify a  value  for  Resour-
                   cePath .

                 For  more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether an
                 Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

              ResourcePath -> (string)
                 The path that you want Route 53 to  request  when  performing
                 health  checks.  The path can be any value that your endpoint
                 returns an HTTP status code of a 2xx or 3xx format  for  when
                 the    endpoint    is    healthy.    An   example   file   is
                 /docs/route53-health-check.html . Route 53 automatically adds
                 the  DNS  name  for the service. If you don't specify a value
                 for ResourcePath , the default value is / .

                 If you specify TCP for Type , you must not  specify  a  value
                 for ResourcePath .

              FailureThreshold -> (integer)
                 The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must
                 pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the
                 endpoint  from  unhealthy to healthy or the other way around.
                 For more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether  an
                 Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          A  value that you can use to determine whether the request completed
          successfully. To get the status of the operation, see GetOperation .
