OPTIONS
       --target-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

       --health-check-protocol (string)
          The protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on
          targets.  For  Application  Load Balancers, the default is HTTP. For
          Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers,  the  default  is
          TCP. The TCP protocol is not supported for health checks if the pro-
          tocol of the target group is HTTP or  HTTPS.  It  is  supported  for
          health  checks only if the protocol of the target group is TCP, TLS,
          UDP, or TCP_UDP. The GENEVE, TLS, UDP, and TCP_UDP protocols are not
          supported for health checks.

          With Network Load Balancers, you can't modify this setting.

          Possible values:

          o HTTP

          o HTTPS

          o TCP

          o TLS

          o UDP

          o TCP_UDP

          o GENEVE

       --health-check-port (string)
          The  port  the  load  balancer uses when performing health checks on
          targets.

       --health-check-path (string)
          [HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The destination for health checks on  the
          targets.

          [HTTP1 or HTTP2 protocol version] The ping path. The default is /.

          [GRPC  protocol  version]  The  path of a custom health check method
          with the format /package.service/method. The default is /Amazon  Web
          Services.ALB/healthcheck.

       --health-check-enabled | --no-health-check-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether health checks are enabled.

       --health-check-interval-seconds (integer)
          The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of
          an individual target. For TCP health checks,  the  supported  values
          are 10 or 30 seconds.

          With Network Load Balancers, you can't modify this setting.

       --health-check-timeout-seconds (integer)
          [HTTP/HTTPS  health  checks]  The amount of time, in seconds, during
          which no response means a failed health check.

          With Network Load Balancers, you can't modify this setting.

       --healthy-threshold-count (integer)
          The number of consecutive health checks  successes  required  before
          considering an unhealthy target healthy.

       --unhealthy-threshold-count (integer)
          The number of consecutive health check failures required before con-
          sidering the target unhealthy. For target groups with a protocol  of
          TCP  or  TLS,  this  value must be the same as the healthy threshold
          count.

       --matcher (structure)
          [HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The HTTP or gRPC codes to use when check-
          ing for a successful response from a target.

          With Network Load Balancers, you can't modify this setting.

          HttpCode -> (string)
              For  Application  Load Balancers, you can specify values between
              200 and 499, and the default value is 200. You can specify  mul-
              tiple  values (for example, "200,202") or a range of values (for
              example, "200-299").

              For Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers, this must
              be "200399".

              Note  that when using shorthand syntax, some values such as com-
              mas need to be escaped.

          GrpcCode -> (string)
              You can specify values between 0 and 99. You can specify  multi-
              ple  values (for example, "0,1") or a range of values (for exam-
              ple, "0-5"). The default value is 12.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          HttpCode=string,GrpcCode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "HttpCode": "string",
            "GrpcCode": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
