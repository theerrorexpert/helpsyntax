CREATE-LISTENER()                                            CREATE-LISTENER()



NAME
       create-listener -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a listener for the specified Application Load Balancer, Network
       Load Balancer, or Gateway Load Balancer.

       For more information, see the following:

       o Listeners for your Application Load Balancers

       o Listeners for your Network Load Balancers

       o Listeners for your Gateway Load Balancers

       This operation is idempotent, which means that it completes at most one
       time.  If  you  attempt to create multiple listeners with the same set-
       tings, each call succeeds.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

       --protocol (string)
          The protocol for connections from clients to the load balancer.  For
          Application  Load  Balancers,  the  supported protocols are HTTP and
          HTTPS. For Network Load Balancers, the supported protocols are  TCP,
          TLS,  UDP, and TCP_UDP. You cant specify the UDP or TCP_UDP protocol
          if dual-stack mode is enabled. You cannot specify a protocol  for  a
          Gateway Load Balancer.

          Possible values:

          o HTTP

          o HTTPS

          o TCP

          o TLS

          o UDP

          o TCP_UDP

          o GENEVE

       --port (integer)
          The port on which the load balancer is listening. You cannot specify
          a port for a Gateway Load Balancer.

       --ssl-policy (string)
          [HTTPS and TLS listeners] The security  policy  that  defines  which
          protocols and ciphers are supported.

          For  more information, see Security policies in the Application Load
          Balancers Guide and Security policies in the Network Load  Balancers
          Guide .

       --certificates (list)
          [HTTPS  and TLS listeners] The default certificate for the listener.
          You must provide exactly one certificate. Set CertificateArn to  the
          certificate ARN but do not set IsDefault .

          (structure)
              Information about an SSL server certificate.

              CertificateArn -> (string)

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the certificate is the default certificate.
                 Do not set this value when specifying  a  certificate  as  an
                 input. This value is not included in the output when describ-
                 ing a listener, but is included when describing listener cer-
                 tificates.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags to assign to the listener.

          (structure)
              Information about a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create an HTTP listener

       The  following create-listener example creates an HTTP listener for the
       specified Application Load Balancer that forwards requests to the spec-
       ified target group.

          aws elbv2 create-listener \
              --load-balancer-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188 \
              --protocol HTTP \
              --port 80 \
              --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-targets/73e2d6bc24d8a067

       For more information, see Tutorial: Create an Application Load Balancer
       using the AWS CLI in the User Guide for Application Load Balancers.

       Example 2: To create an HTTPS listener

       The following create-listener example creates an HTTPS listener for the
       specified Application Load Balancer that forwards requests to the spec-
       ified target group. You must specify an SSL certificate  for  an  HTTPS
       listener.  You can create and manage certificates using AWS Certificate
       Manager (ACM).  Alternatively,  you  can  create  a  certificate  using
       SSL/TLS  tools,  get  the certificate signed by a certificate authority
       (CA), and upload the certificate to AWS Identity and Access  Management
       (IAM).

          aws elbv2 create-listener \
              --load-balancer-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188 \
              --protocol HTTPS \
              --port 443 \
              --certificates CertificateArn=arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate/3dcb0a41-bd72-4774-9ad9-756919c40557 \

       specified Network Load Balancer that forwards requests to the specified
       target group.

          aws elbv2 create-listener \
              --load-balancer-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/net/my-network-load-balancer/5d1b75f4f1cee11e \
              --protocol TCP \

       The  following  create-listener  example creates a TLS listener for the
       specified Network Load Balancer that forwards requests to the specified
       target group. You must specify an SSL certificate for a TLS listener.

          aws elbv2 create-listener \
              --load-balancer-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188 \
              --protocol TLS \
              --port 443 \
              --certificates CertificateArn=arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate/3dcb0a41-bd72-4774-9ad9-756919c40557 \
              --ssl-policy ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08 \
              --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-targets/73e2d6bc24d8a067

       specified Network Load Balancer that forwards requests to the specified
       target group.

          aws elbv2 create-listener \
              --load-balancer-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/net/my-network-load-balancer/5d1b75f4f1cee11e \
              --protocol UDP \
