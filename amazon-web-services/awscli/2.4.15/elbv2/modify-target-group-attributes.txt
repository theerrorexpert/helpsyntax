SYNOPSIS
            modify-target-group-attributes
          --target-group-arn <value>
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

       --attributes (list)
          The attributes.

          (structure)
              Information about a target group attribute.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

                 The following attribute is supported by all load balancers:

                 o deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds  - The amount of time,
                   in seconds, for  Elastic  Load  Balancing  to  wait  before
                   changing  the state of a deregistering target from draining
                   to unused . The range is 0-3600 seconds. The default  value
                   is  300  seconds.  If the target is a Lambda function, this
                   attribute is not supported.

                 The following attributes are supported  by  both  Application
                 Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers:

                 o stickiness.enabled  - Indicates whether sticky sessions are
                   enabled. The value is true or false . The default is  false
                   .

                 o stickiness.type - The type of sticky sessions. The possible
                   values are lb_cookie and app_cookie  for  Application  Load
                   Balancers or source_ip for Network Load Balancers.

                 The  following attributes are supported only if the load bal-
                 ancer is an Application Load Balancer and the  target  is  an
                 instance or an IP address:

                 o load_balancing.algorithm.type  -  The  load balancing algo-
                   rithm determines how the load balancer selects targets when
                   routing  requests.  The  value is round_robin or least_out-
                   standing_requests . The default is round_robin .

                 o slow_start.duration_seconds - The time period, in  seconds,
                   during which a newly registered target receives an increas-
                   ing share of the traffic to the target  group.  After  this
                   time  period  ends,  the  target receives its full share of
                   traffic. The range is  30-900  seconds  (15  minutes).  The
                   default is 0 seconds (disabled).

                 o stickiness.app_cookie.cookie_name  -  Indicates the name of
                   the application-based cookie. Names  that  start  with  the
                   following  prefixes  are  not allowed: AWSALB , AWSALBAPP ,
                   and AWSALBTG ; they're reserved for use by  the  load  bal-
                   ancer.

                 o stickiness.app_cookie.duration_seconds  -  The time period,
                   in seconds, during which requests from a client  should  be
                   routed  to the same target. After this time period expires,
                   the application-based cookie is considered stale. The range
                   is  1  second to 1 week (604800 seconds). The default value
                   is 1 day (86400 seconds).

                 o stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds - The time period, in
                   seconds,  during  which  requests  from  a client should be
                   routed to the same target. After this time period  expires,
                   the load balancer-generated cookie is considered stale. The
                   range is 1 second to 1 week (604800 seconds).  The  default
                   value is 1 day (86400 seconds).

                 The  following  attribute  is supported only if the load bal-
                 ancer is an Application Load Balancer and  the  target  is  a
                 Lambda function:

                 o lambda.multi_value_headers.enabled  - Indicates whether the
                   request and response headers that are exchanged between the
                   load  balancer  and  the  Lambda function include arrays of
                   values or strings. The value is true or false . The default
                   is false . If the value is false and the request contains a
                   duplicate header field name or  query  parameter  key,  the
                   load balancer uses the last value sent by the client.

                 The  following  attributes are supported only by Network Load
                 Balancers:

                 o deregistration_delay.connection_termination.enabled - Indi-
                   cates  whether  the load balancer terminates connections at
                   the end of the deregistration timeout. The value is true or
                   false . The default is false .

                 o preserve_client_ip.enabled  -  Indicates  whether client IP
                   preservation is enabled. The value is true or false  .  The
                   default  is disabled if the target group type is IP address
                   and the target group protocol is TCP or TLS. Otherwise, the
                   default  is  enabled. Client IP preservation cannot be dis-
                   abled for UDP and TCP_UDP target groups.

                 o proxy_protocol_v2.enabled - Indicates whether Proxy  Proto-
                   col  version 2 is enabled. The value is true or false . The
                   default is false .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 o stickiness.app_cookie.duration_seconds  -  The time period,
                   in seconds, during which requests from a client  should  be
                   routed  to the same target. After this time period expires,
