CREATE-LOAD-BALANCER()                                  CREATE-LOAD-BALANCER()



NAME
       create-load-balancer -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Gateway
       Load Balancer.

       For more information, see the following:

       o Application Load Balancers

       o Network Load Balancers

       o Gateway Load Balancers

       This operation is idempotent, which means that it completes at most one
       time.  If  you  attempt to create multiple load balancers with the same
       settings, each call succeeds.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

          This name must be unique per region per account, can have a  maximum
          of  32  characters,  must  contain  only  alphanumeric characters or
          hyphens, must not begin or end with a hyphen,  and  must  not  begin
          with "internal-".

       --subnets (list)
          The  IDs  of the public subnets. You can specify only one subnet per
          Availability Zone. You must specify either subnets  or  subnet  map-
          pings.

          [Application  Load Balancers] You must specify subnets from at least
          two Availability Zones.

          [Application Load Balancers on Outposts] You must specify  one  Out-
          post subnet.

          [Application  Load Balancers on Local Zones] You can specify subnets
          from one or more Local Zones.

          [Network Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from  one  or  more
          Availability Zones.

          [Gateway  Load  Balancers]  You can specify subnets from one or more
          Availability Zones.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subnet-mappings (list)
          The IDs of the public subnets. You can specify only one  subnet  per
          Availability  Zone.  You  must specify either subnets or subnet map-
          pings.

          [Application Load Balancers] You must specify subnets from at  least
          two  Availability Zones. You cannot specify Elastic IP addresses for
          your subnets.

          [Application Load Balancers on Outposts] You must specify  one  Out-
          post subnet.

          [Application  Load Balancers on Local Zones] You can specify subnets
          from one or more Local Zones.

          [Network Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from  one  or  more
          Availability  Zones. You can specify one Elastic IP address per sub-
          net if you need static IP addresses for  your  internet-facing  load
          balancer.  For  internal load balancers, you can specify one private
          IP address per subnet from the IPv4 range of the subnet. For  inter-
          net-facing  load balancer, you can specify one IPv6 address per sub-
          net.

          [Gateway Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from  one  or  more
          Availability Zones. You cannot specify Elastic IP addresses for your

              AllocationId -> (string)
                 [Network Load Balancers] The allocation ID of the Elastic  IP
                 address for an internet-facing load balancer.

              PrivateIPv4Address -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetId=string,AllocationId=string,PrivateIPv4Address=string,IPv6Address=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SubnetId": "string",
              "AllocationId": "string",
              "PrivateIPv4Address": "string",
              "IPv6Address": "string"

       --security-groups (list)
          [Application Load Balancers] The IDs of the security groups for  the
          load balancer.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --scheme (string)
          The  nodes  of  an  Internet-facing  load  balancer  have  public IP
          addresses. The DNS name of an Internet-facing load balancer is  pub-
          licly resolvable to the public IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore,
          Internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients  over
          the internet.

          The  nodes  of  an  internal  load  balancer  have  only  private IP
          addresses. The DNS name of an internal  load  balancer  is  publicly
          resolvable  to  the  private  IP  addresses of the nodes. Therefore,
          internal load balancers can route requests only  from  clients  with
          access to the VPC for the load balancer.

          The default is an Internet-facing load balancer.

          You cannot specify a scheme for a Gateway Load Balancer.

          Possible values:

          o internet-facing

          o internal

       --tags (list)
          The tags to assign to the load balancer.

          (structure)
              Information about a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --type (string)
          The type of load balancer. The default is application .

          Possible values:

          o application

          o network

          o gateway

       --ip-address-type (string)
          The type of IP addresses used by the subnets for your load balancer.
          The possible values are ipv4 (for IPv4 addresses) and dualstack (for
          IPv4 and IPv6 addresses).

          Possible values:

          o ipv4

          o dualstack

       --customer-owned-ipv4-pool (string)
          [Application  Load  Balancers  on  Outposts]  The  ID  of  the  cus-
          tomer-owned address pool (CoIP pool).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

          (structure)
              Information about a load balancer.

              LoadBalancerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

              DNSName -> (string)
                 The public DNS name of the load balancer.

              CanonicalHostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone associated with the
                 load balancer.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the load balancer was created.

              LoadBalancerName -> (string)
                 The name of the load balancer.

              Scheme -> (string)
                 The nodes of an Internet-facing load balancer have public  IP
                 addresses.  The  DNS name of an Internet-facing load balancer
                 is publicly resolvable to the  public  IP  addresses  of  the
                 nodes.  Therefore,  Internet-facing  load balancers can route
                 requests from clients over the internet.

                 The nodes of an internal load balancer have only  private  IP
                 addresses.  The DNS name of an internal load balancer is pub-
                 licly resolvable to the private IP addresses  of  the  nodes.
                 Therefore,  internal  load  balancers can route requests only
                 from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC for the load balancer.

              State -> (structure)
                 The state of the load balancer.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The state code. The initial state of the load balancer is
                     provisioning  .  After  the load balancer is fully set up
                     and ready to route traffic, its state is active . If load
                     balancer  is  routing  traffic  but  does  not  have  the
                     resources    it    needs    to    scale,    its     state
                     is``active_impaired`` . If the load balancer could not be
                     set up, its state is failed .

                 Reason -> (string)
                     A description of the state.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of load balancer.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 The subnets for the load balancer.

                 (structure)

                     ZoneName -> (string)
                        The name of the Availability Zone.

                     SubnetId -> (string)
                        The ID of the subnet. You can specify one  subnet  per
                        Availability Zone.

                     LoadBalancerAddresses -> (list)
                        [Network  Load  Balancers]  If  you  need  static   IP
                        addresses  for your load balancer, you can specify one
                        Elastic IP address per Availability Zone when you cre-
                        ate  an  internal-facing  load  balancer. For internal
                        load balancers, you can specify a private  IP  address
                        from the IPv4 range of the subnet.
