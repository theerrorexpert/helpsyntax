MODIFY-LISTENER()                                            MODIFY-LISTENER()



NAME
       modify-listener -

DESCRIPTION
       Replaces  the specified properties of the specified listener. Any prop-
       erties that you do not specify remain unchanged.

       Changing the protocol from HTTPS to HTTP, or from TLS to  TCP,  removes
       the  security  policy and default certificate properties. If you change
       the protocol from HTTP to HTTPS, or from TCP to TLS, you must  add  the
       security policy and default certificate properties.

       To add an item to a list, remove an item from a list, or update an item
       in a list, you must provide the entire list. For  example,  to  add  an
       action, specify a list with the current actions plus the new action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-listener
          --listener-arn <value>
          [--port <value>]
          [--protocol <value>]
          [--ssl-policy <value>]
          [--certificates <value>]
          [--default-actions <value>]
          [--alpn-policy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

       --port (integer)
          The port for connections from clients to the load balancer. You can-
          not specify a port for a Gateway Load Balancer.

       --protocol (string)
          The protocol for connections from  clients  to  the  load  balancer.
          Application  Load  Balancers  support  the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
          Network Load Balancers support the TCP, TLS, UDP, and TCP_UDP proto-
          cols.  You  cant change the protocol to UDP or TCP_UDP if dual-stack
          mode is enabled. You cannot specify a protocol for  a  Gateway  Load
          Balancer.

          Possible values:

          o HTTP

          o HTTPS

          o TCP

          o TLS

          o UDP

          o TCP_UDP

          o GENEVE

       --ssl-policy (string)
          [HTTPS  and  TLS  listeners]  The security policy that defines which
          protocols and ciphers are supported.

          For more information, see Security policies in the Application  Load
          Balancers  Guide  or Security policies in the Network Load Balancers
          Guide .

       --certificates (list)
          [HTTPS and TLS listeners] The default certificate for the  listener.
          You  must provide exactly one certificate. Set CertificateArn to the
          certificate ARN but do not set IsDefault .

          (structure)
              Information about an SSL server certificate.

              CertificateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate.

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the certificate is the default certificate.
                 Do  not  set  this  value when specifying a certificate as an
                 input. This value is not included in the output when describ-
                 ing a listener, but is included when describing listener cer-
                 tificates.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CertificateArn=string,IsDefault=boolean ...

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To change the default action to a forward action

       The following modify-listener example changes the default action (to  a
       forward action)for the specified listener.
