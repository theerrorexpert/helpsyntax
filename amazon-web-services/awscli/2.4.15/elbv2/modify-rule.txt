NAME
       modify-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Replaces the specified properties of the specified rule. Any properties
       that you do not specify are unchanged.

       To add an item to a list, remove an item from a list, or update an item
       in  a  list,  you  must provide the entire list. For example, to add an
       action, specify a list with the current actions plus the new action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-rule
          --rule-arn <value>
          [--conditions <value>]
          [--actions <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.

       --conditions (list)
          The conditions.

          (structure)
              Information about a condition for a rule.

              Each rule can optionally include up to one of each of  the  fol-
              lowing conditions: http-request-method , host-header , path-pat-
              tern , and source-ip . Each rule can also optionally include one
              or  more  of  each  of the following conditions: http-header and
              query-string .

              Field -> (string)
                 The field in the HTTP request. The following are the possible
                 values:

                 o http-header

                 o http-request-method

                 o host-header

                 o path-pattern

                 o query-string

                 o source-ip

              Values -> (list)
                 The  condition  value. Specify only when Field is host-header
                 or path-pattern . Alternatively,  to  specify  multiple  host
                 names  or  multiple  path  patterns,  use HostHeaderConfig or
                 PathPatternConfig .

                 If Field is host-header and you are not using  HostHeaderCon-
                 fig  ,  you  can  specify  a  single  host name (for example,
                 my.example.com) in Values . A host name is case  insensitive,
                 can be up to 128 characters in length, and can contain any of
                 the following characters.

                 o A-Z, a-z, 0-9

                 o

                   o .

                 o

                   o (matches 0 or more characters)

                 o ? (matches exactly 1 character)

                 If Field is path-pattern and you are not  using  PathPattern-
                 Config  , you can specify a single path pattern (for example,
                 /img/
                 *
                 ) in Values . A path pattern is case-sensitive, can be up  to
                 128  characters in length, and can contain any of the follow-
                 ing characters.

                 o A-Z, a-z, 0-9

                 o _ - . $ / ~ " ' @ : +

                 o & (using &amp;)

                 o

                   o (matches 0 or more characters)

                 o ? (matches exactly 1 character)

                 (string)

              HostHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                 Information for a host header condition.  Specify  only  when
                 Field is host-header .

                 Values -> (list)
                     One  or more host names. The maximum size of each name is
                     128 characters. The comparison is case  insensitive.  The
                     following wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0
                     or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1  character).

                     If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is satis-
                     fied if one of the strings matches the host name.

                     (string)

              PathPatternConfig -> (structure)
                 Information for a path pattern condition. Specify  only  when
                 Field is path-pattern .

                 Values -> (list)
                     One  or more path patterns to compare against the request
                     URL. The maximum size of each string is  128  characters.
                     The  comparison is case sensitive. The following wildcard
                     characters are supported: * (matches 0  or  more  charac-
                     ters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).

                     If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is satis-
                     fied if one of them matches the  request  URL.  The  path
                     pattern  is  compared only to the path of the URL, not to
                     its query string. To compare against  the  query  string,
                     use  QueryStringConditionConfig .

                     (string)

              HttpHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  for  an HTTP header condition. Specify only when
                 Field is http-header .

                 HttpHeaderName -> (string)
                     The name of the HTTP header field. The maximum size is 40
                     characters.  The  header  name  is  case insensitive. The
                     allowed characters are specified by RFC  7230.  Wildcards
                     are not supported.

                     You  can't  use  an  HTTP header condition to specify the
                     host header. Use  HostHeaderConditionConfig to specify  a
                     host header condition.

                 Values -> (list)
                     One  or  more strings to compare against the value of the
                     HTTP header. The maximum size of each string is 128 char-
                     acters.  The comparison strings are case insensitive. The
                     following wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0
                     or  more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).

                     If the same header appears multiple times in the request,
                     we search them in order until a match is found.

                     If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is satis-
                     fied if one of the strings matches the value of the  HTTP
                     header.  To  require that all of the strings are a match,
                     create one condition per string.

                     (string)

              QueryStringConfig -> (structure)
                 Information for a query string condition. Specify  only  when
                 Field is query-string .

                 Values -> (list)
                     One  or  more  key/value  pairs  or values to find in the
                     query string. The maximum size  of  each  string  is  128
                     characters.  The comparison is case insensitive. The fol-
                     lowing wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0 or
                     more  characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character). To
                     search for a literal '*' or  '?'  character  in  a  query
                     string,  you must escape these characters in Values using
                     a '' character.

                     If you specify multiple key/value pairs  or  values,  the
                     condition  is  satisfied  if  one of them is found in the
                     query string.

                     (structure)
                        Information about a key/value pair.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The key. You can omit the key.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value.

              HttpRequestMethodConfig -> (structure)
                 Information for an HTTP method condition. Specify  only  when
                 Field is http-request-method .

                 Values -> (list)
                     The  name  of  the request method. The maximum size is 40
                     characters. The allowed characters are A-Z,  hyphen  (-),
                     and  underscore  (_).  The  comparison is case sensitive.
                     Wildcards are not supported; therefore, the  method  name
                     must be an exact match.

                     If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is satis-
                     fied if one of  the  strings  matches  the  HTTP  request
                     method. We recommend that you route GET and HEAD requests
                     in the same way, because the response to a  HEAD  request
                     may be cached.

                     (string)

              SourceIpConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  for  a  source  IP  condition. Specify only when
                 Field is source-ip .

                 Values -> (list)
                     One or more source IP addresses, in CIDR format. You  can
                     use  both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Wildcards are not sup-
                     ported.

                     If you specify multiple addresses, the condition is  sat-
                     isfied  if  the  source IP address of the request matches
                     one of the CIDR blocks. This condition is  not  satisfied
                     by the addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header. To search
                     for addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header,  use   Http-
                     HeaderConditionConfig .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                            request URL. The maximum size of  each  string  is
                            128  characters. The comparison is case sensitive.
                            The following wildcard characters are supported: *
                            (matches  0  or  more  characters)  and ? (matches
                            exactly 1 character).

                            satisfied  if one of them matches the request URL.
                            The path pattern is compared only to the  path  of
                            the  URL,  not  to  its  query  string. To compare
                            against the query string,  use   QueryStringCondi-
                            tionConfig .

                            (string)

                     HttpHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for an HTTP header condition. Specify only
                        when Field is http-header .

                        HttpHeaderName -> (string)
                            The name of the HTTP  header  field.  The  maximum
                            size  is  40  characters.  The header name is case
                            insensitive. The allowed characters are  specified
                            by RFC 7230. Wildcards are not supported.

                            You  can't use an HTTP header condition to specify
                            the host header. Use  HostHeaderConditionConfig to
                            specify a host header condition.

                        Values -> (list)
                            One  or  more strings to compare against the value
                            of the HTTP  header.  The  maximum  size  of  each
                            string  is  128 characters. The comparison strings
                            are case insensitive. The following wildcard char-
                            acters are supported: * (matches 0 or more charac-
                            ters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).

                            If the same header appears multiple times  in  the
                            request,  we search them in order until a match is
                            found.

                            If you specify multiple strings, the condition  is
                            satisfied  if one of the strings matches the value
                            of the HTTP header. To require  that  all  of  the
                            strings  are  a  match,  create  one condition per
                            string.

                            (string)

                     QueryStringConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for a query string condition. Specify only
                        when Field is query-string .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One  or  more key/value pairs or values to find in
                            the query string. The maximum size of each  string
                            is 128 characters. The comparison is case insensi-
                            tive. The following wildcard characters  are  sup-
                            ported:  *  (matches  0  or more characters) and ?
                            (matches exactly 1 character).  To  search  for  a
                            literal  '*'  or  '?' character in a query string,
                            you must escape these characters in Values using a
                            '' character.

                            If you specify multiple key/value pairs or values,
                            the condition is satisfied if one of them is found
                            in the query string.

                            (structure)
                               Information about a key/value pair.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The key. You can omit the key.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value.

                     HttpRequestMethodConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for an HTTP method condition. Specify only
                        when Field is http-request-method .

                        Values -> (list)
                            The name of the request method. The  maximum  size
                            is  40 characters. The allowed characters are A-Z,
                            hyphen (-), and underscore (_). The comparison  is
                            case   sensitive.  Wildcards  are  not  supported;
                            therefore, the method name must be an exact match.

                            If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is
                            satisfied if one of the strings matches  the  HTTP
                            request  method.  We  recommend that you route GET
                            and HEAD requests in the  same  way,  because  the
                            response to a HEAD request may be cached.

                            (string)

                     SourceIpConfig -> (structure)
                        Information  for  a  source IP condition. Specify only
                        when Field is source-ip .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One or more source IP addresses, in  CIDR  format.
                            You  can  use  both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Wild-
                            cards are not supported.

                            If you specify multiple addresses,  the  condition
                            is  satisfied  if  the  source  IP  address of the
                            request matches one of the CIDR blocks. This  con-
                            dition  is  not  satisfied by the addresses in the
                            X-Forwarded-For header. To search for addresses in
                            the  X-Forwarded-For header, use  HttpHeaderCondi-
                            tionConfig .
