DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()                            DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()



NAME
       describe-load-balancers -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified load balancers or all of your load balancers.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-load-balancers  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: LoadBalancers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancers
          [--load-balancer-arns <value>]
          [--names <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the load balancers. You can spec-
          ify up to 20 load balancers in a single call.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --names (list)
          The names of the load balancers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       To describe all load balancers

       This example describes all of your load balancers.

       Command:

          aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers

OUTPUT
       LoadBalancers -> (list)
          Information about the load balancers.

          (structure)
              Information about a load balancer.

              LoadBalancerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

              DNSName -> (string)
                 The public DNS name of the load balancer.

              CanonicalHostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone associated with the
                 load balancer.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the load balancer was created.

              LoadBalancerName -> (string)
                 The name of the load balancer.

              Scheme -> (string)
                 The  nodes of an Internet-facing load balancer have public IP
                 addresses. The DNS name of an Internet-facing  load  balancer
                 is  publicly  resolvable  to  the  public IP addresses of the
                 nodes. Therefore, Internet-facing load  balancers  can  route
                 requests from clients over the internet.

                 The  nodes  of an internal load balancer have only private IP
                 addresses. The DNS name of an internal load balancer is  pub-
                 licly  resolvable  to  the private IP addresses of the nodes.
                 Therefore, internal load balancers can  route  requests  only
                 from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC for the load balancer.

              State -> (structure)
                 The state of the load balancer.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The state code. The initial state of the load balancer is
                     provisioning . After the load balancer is  fully  set  up
                     and ready to route traffic, its state is active . If load
                     balancer  is  routing  traffic  but  does  not  have  the
                     resources     it    needs    to    scale,    its    state
                     is``active_impaired`` . If the load balancer could not be
                     set up, its state is failed .

                 Reason -> (string)
                     A description of the state.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of load balancer.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 The subnets for the load balancer.

                 (structure)
                     Information about an Availability Zone.

                     ZoneName -> (string)
                        The name of the Availability Zone.

                     SubnetId -> (string)
                        The  ID  of the subnet. You can specify one subnet per
                        Availability Zone.

                     OutpostId -> (string)
                        [Application Load Balancers on Outposts] The ID of the
                        Outpost.

                     LoadBalancerAddresses -> (list)
                        [Network   Load  Balancers]  If  you  need  static  IP
                        addresses for your load balancer, you can specify  one
                        Elastic IP address per Availability Zone when you cre-
                        ate an internal-facing  load  balancer.  For  internal
                        load  balancers,  you can specify a private IP address
                        from the IPv4 range of the subnet.

                        (structure)
                            Information about a static IP address for  a  load
                            balancer.

                            IpAddress -> (string)
                               The static IP address.

                            AllocationId -> (string)
                               [Network  Load  Balancers] The allocation ID of
                               the Elastic IP address for  an  internal-facing
                               load balancer.

                            IPv6Address -> (string)
                               [Network Load Balancers] The IPv6 address.

              SecurityGroups -> (list)
                 The IDs of the security groups for the load balancer.

                 (string)

              IpAddressType -> (string)
                 The type of IP addresses used by the subnets  for  your  load
                 balancer.  The  possible values are ipv4 (for IPv4 addresses)
                 and dualstack (for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses).

              CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool -> (string)
                 [Application Load Balancers on Outposts] The ID of  the  cus-
                 tomer-owned address pool.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the marker for the next set
