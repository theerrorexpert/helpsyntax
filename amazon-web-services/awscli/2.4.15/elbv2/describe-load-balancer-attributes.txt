NAME
       describe-load-balancer-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  attributes for the specified Application Load Balancer,
       Network Load Balancer, or Gateway Load Balancer.

       For more information, see the following:

       o Load balancer attributes in the Application Load Balancers Guide

       o Load balancer attributes in the Network Load Balancers Guide

       o Load balancer attributes in the Gateway Load Balancers Guide

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancer-attributes
          --load-balancer-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following describe-load-balancer-attributes  example  displays  the
       attributes of the specified load balancer.

OUTPUT
       Attributes -> (list)
          Information about the load balancer attributes.

          (structure)
              Information about a load balancer attribute.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

                 The following attribute is supported by all load balancers:

                 o deletion_protection.enabled  -  Indicates  whether deletion
                   protection is enabled. The value is true  or  false  .  The
                   default is false .

                 The  following  attributes  are supported by both Application
                 Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers:

                 o access_logs.s3.enabled - Indicates whether access logs  are
                   enabled.  The value is true or false . The default is false
                   .

                 o access_logs.s3.bucket - The name of the S3 bucket  for  the
                   access  logs. This attribute is required if access logs are
                   enabled. The bucket must exist in the same  region  as  the
                   load  balancer and have a bucket policy that grants Elastic
                   Load Balancing permissions to write to the bucket.

                 o access_logs.s3.prefix - The prefix for the location in  the
                   S3 bucket for the access logs.

                 o ipv6.deny-all-igw-traffic  -  Blocks internet gateway (IGW)
                   access to the load balancer. It is set to false for  inter-
                   net-facing  load  balancers and true for internal load bal-
                   ancers, preventing unintended access to your internal  load
                   balancer through an internet gateway.

                 The  following  attributes  are supported by only Application
                 Load Balancers:

                 o idle_timeout.timeout_seconds - The idle timeout  value,  in
                   seconds.  The valid range is 1-4000 seconds. The default is
                   60 seconds.

                 o routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode -  Determines  how  the
                   load  balancer  handles requests that might pose a security
                   risk to your application. The possible values are monitor ,
                   defensive , and strictest . The default is defensive .

                 o routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled - Indicates
                   whether HTTP headers with invalid header fields are removed
                   by the load balancer (true ) or routed to targets (false ).
                   The default is false .

                 o routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled  -
                   Indicates  whether  the two headers (x-amzn-tls-version and
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite ), which contain information  about
                   the  negotiated  TLS version and cipher suite, are added to
                   the client request before sending it  to  the  target.  The
                   x-amzn-tls-version  header  has  information  about the TLS
                   protocol  version  negotiated  with  the  client,  and  the
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite  header  has  information about the
                   cipher suite negotiated with the client. Both  headers  are
                   in  OpenSSL  format.  The possible values for the attribute
                   are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.xff_client_port.enabled  -  Indicates  whether
                   the  X-Forwarded-For header should preserve the source port
                   that the client used to connect to the load  balancer.  The
                   possible values are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http2.enabled  -  Indicates   whether   HTTP/2   is
                   enabled.  The  possible  values  are  true  and false . The
                   default is true . Elastic Load Balancing requires that mes-
                   sage  header names contain only alphanumeric characters and
                   hyphens.

                 o waf.fail_open.enabled  -  Indicates  whether  to  allow   a
                   WAF-enabled  load  balancer to route requests to targets if
                   it is unable to forward the request to Amazon Web  Services
                   WAF.  The  possible values are true and false . The default
                   is false .

                 The following attribute is supported  by  Network  Load  Bal-
                 ancers and Gateway Load Balancers:

                 o load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled   -   Indicates   whether
                   cross-zone load balancing is enabled. The  possible  values
                   are true and false . The default is false .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.
