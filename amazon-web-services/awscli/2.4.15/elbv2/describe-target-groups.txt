DESCRIBE-TARGET-GROUPS()                              DESCRIBE-TARGET-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-target-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the specified target groups or all of your target groups. By
       default, all target groups are described. Alternatively, you can  spec-
       ify  one  of  the  following to filter the results: the ARN of the load
       balancer, the names of one or more target groups, or the ARNs of one or
       more target groups.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-target-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: TargetGroups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-target-groups
          [--load-balancer-arn <value>]
          [--target-group-arns <value>]
          [--names <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

       --target-group-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the target groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --names (list)
          The names of the target groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
