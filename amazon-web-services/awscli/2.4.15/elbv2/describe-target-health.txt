NAME
       describe-target-health -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the health of the specified targets or all of your targets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-target-health
          --target-group-arn <value>
          [--targets <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

       --targets (list)
          The targets.

          (structure)
              Information about a target.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID of the target. If the target type of the target group
                 is instance , specify an instance ID. If the target  type  is
                 ip  ,  specify  an IP address. If the target type is lambda ,
                 specify the ARN of the Lambda function. If the target type is
                 alb  ,  specify the ARN of the Application Load Balancer tar-
                 get.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port on which the target  is  listening.  If  the  target
                 group  protocol is GENEVE, the supported port is 6081. If the
                 target type is alb , the targeted Application  Load  Balancer
                 must have at least one listener whose port matches the target
                 group port. Not used if the target is a Lambda function.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 An Availability Zone or all .  This  determines  whether  the
                 target  receives  traffic from the load balancer nodes in the
                 specified Availability Zone or from all enabled  Availability
                 Zones for the load balancer.

                 This  parameter  is  not  supported if the target type of the
                 target group is instance or alb .

                 If the target type is ip and the IP address is in a subnet of
                 the  VPC for the target group, the Availability Zone is auto-
                 matically detected and this parameter is optional. If the  IP
                 address is outside the VPC, this parameter is required.

                 With  an  Application Load Balancer, if the target type is ip
                 and the IP address is outside the VPC for the  target  group,
                 the only supported value is all .

                 If the target type is lambda , this parameter is optional and
                 the only supported value is all .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Port=integer,AvailabilityZone=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "Port": integer,
              "AvailabilityZone": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To describe the health of the targets for a target group

       The following describe-target-health example  displays  health  details
       for  the  targets  of  the  specified  target  group. These targets are
       healthy.

          aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
              --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-targets/73e2d6bc24d8a067

       Output:

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "i-ceddcd4d",
                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "healthy"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "i-0f76fade",
                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "healthy"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To describe the health of a target

       The following describe-target-health example  displays  health  details
       for the specified target. This target is healthy.

          aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
              --targets Id=i-0f76fade,Port=80 \
              --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-targets/73e2d6bc24d8a067

       Output:

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "i-0f76fade",
                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "healthy"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The  following example output is for a target whose target group is not
       specified in an action for a listener. This target can't receive  traf-
       fic from the load balancer.

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
              {
                  "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                  "Target": {
                      "Id": "i-0f76fade",
                      "Port": 80
                  },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "unused",
                          "Reason": "Target.NotInUse",
                          "Description": "Target group is not configured to receive traffic from the load balancer"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The  following  example  output  is for a target whose target group was
       just specified in an action for a listener. The target is  still  being
       registered.

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "i-0f76fade",
                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "initial",
                          "Reason": "Elb.RegistrationInProgress",
                          "Description": "Target registration is in progress"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The following example output is for an unhealthy target.

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "i-0f76fade",
                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "unhealthy",
                          "Reason": "Target.Timeout",
                          "Description": "Connection to target timed out"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The  following example output is for a target that is a Lambda function
       and health checks are disabled.

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function",
                          "AvailabilityZone": "all",
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "unavailable",
                          "Reason": "Target.HealthCheckDisabled",
                          "Description": "Health checks are not enabled for this target"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       TargetHealthDescriptions -> (list)
          Information about the health of the targets.

          (structure)
              Information about the health of a target.

              Target -> (structure)
                 The description of the target.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The ID of the target. If the target type  of  the  target
                     group is instance , specify an instance ID. If the target
                     type is ip , specify an IP address. If the target type is
                     lambda  ,  specify the ARN of the Lambda function. If the
                     target type is alb , specify the ARN of  the  Application
                     Load Balancer target.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The  port on which the target is listening. If the target
                     group protocol is GENEVE, the supported port is 6081.  If
                     the  target  type  is alb , the targeted Application Load
                     Balancer must have  at  least  one  listener  whose  port
                     matches  the target group port. Not used if the target is
                     a Lambda function.

                 AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                     An Availability Zone or all . This determines whether the
                     target  receives  traffic from the load balancer nodes in
                     the specified  Availability  Zone  or  from  all  enabled
                     Availability Zones for the load balancer.

                     This parameter is not supported if the target type of the
                     target group is instance or alb .

                     If the target type is ip and the IP address is in a  sub-
                     net  of  the  VPC  for the target group, the Availability
                     Zone is automatically  detected  and  this  parameter  is
                     optional.  If  the  IP  address  is outside the VPC, this
                     parameter is required.

                     With an Application Load Balancer, if the target type  is
                     ip  and  the IP address is outside the VPC for the target
                     group, the only supported value is all .

                     If the target type is lambda , this parameter is optional
                     and the only supported value is all .

              HealthCheckPort -> (string)
                 The port to use to connect with the target.

              TargetHealth -> (structure)
                 The health information for the target.

                 State -> (string)
                     The state of the target.

                 Reason -> (string)
                     The reason code.

                     If  the  target  state  is healthy , a reason code is not
                     provided.

                     If the target state is initial , the reason code  can  be
                     one of the following values:

                     o Elb.RegistrationInProgress  -  The  target  is  in  the
                       process of being registered with the load balancer.

                     o Elb.InitialHealthChecking - The load balancer is  still
                       sending  the target the minimum number of health checks
                       required to determine its health status.

                     If the target state is unhealthy , the reason code can be
                     one of the following values:

                     o Target.ResponseCodeMismatch - The health checks did not
                       return an expected HTTP code. Applies only to  Applica-
                       tion Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers.

                     o Target.Timeout  -  The health check requests timed out.
                       Applies only to Application Load Balancers and  Gateway
                       Load Balancers.

                     o Target.FailedHealthChecks  - The load balancer received
                       an error while establishing a connection to the  target
                       or the target response was malformed.

                     o Elb.InternalError  - The health checks failed due to an
                       internal error. Applies only to Application  Load  Bal-
                       ancers.

                     If  the  target  state is unused , the reason code can be
                     one of the following values:

                     o Target.NotRegistered - The  target  is  not  registered
                       with the target group.

                     o Target.NotInUse  -  The target group is not used by any
                       load balancer or the target is in an Availability  Zone
                       that is not enabled for its load balancer.

                     o Target.InvalidState  -  The target is in the stopped or
                       terminated state.

                     o Target.IpUnusable - The target IP address  is  reserved
                       for use by a load balancer.

                     If  the target state is draining , the reason code can be
                     the following value:

                     o Target.DeregistrationInProgress - The target is in  the
                       process  of  being  deregistered and the deregistration
                       delay period has not expired.

                     If the target state is unavailable , the reason code  can
                     be the following value:

                     o Target.HealthCheckDisabled - Health checks are disabled
                       for the target group. Applies only to Application  Load
                       Balancers.

                     o Elb.InternalError - Target health is unavailable due to
                       an internal error. Applies only to  Network  Load  Bal-
                       ancers.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A  description  of  the target health that provides addi-
                     tional details. If the state is healthy ,  a  description
                     is not provided.
