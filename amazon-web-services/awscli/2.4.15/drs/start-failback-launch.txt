START-FAILBACK-LAUNCH()                                START-FAILBACK-LAUNCH()



NAME
       start-failback-launch -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates  a Job for launching the machine that is being failed back to
       from the specified Recovery Instance. This will run conversion  on  the
       failback client and will reboot your machine, thus completing the fail-
       back process.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-failback-launch
          --recovery-instance-ids <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recovery-instance-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Recovery Instance whose failback launch  we  want  to
          request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (map)
          The tags to be associated with the failback launch Job.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
