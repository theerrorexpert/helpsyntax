NAME
       start-recovery -

DESCRIPTION
       Launches  Recovery Instances for the specified Source Servers. For each
       Source Server you may choose a point in time snapshot to  launch  from,
       or use an on demand snapshot.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-recovery
          [--is-drill | --no-is-drill]
          --source-servers <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --is-drill | --no-is-drill (boolean)
          Whether this Source Server Recovery operation is a drill or not.

       --source-servers (list)
          The Source Servers that we want to start a Recovery Job for.

          (structure)
              An object representing the Source Server to recover.

              recoverySnapshotID -> (string)
                 The  ID  of a Recovery Snapshot we want to recover from. Omit
                 this field to launch  from  the  latest  data  by  taking  an
                 on-demand snapshot.

              sourceServerID -> (string)
                 The ID of the Source Server you want to recover.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          recoverySnapshotID=string,sourceServerID=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "recoverySnapshotID": "string",
              "sourceServerID": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          The tags to be associated with the Recovery Job.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
