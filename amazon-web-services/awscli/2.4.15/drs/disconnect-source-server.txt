DISCONNECT-SOURCE-SERVER()                          DISCONNECT-SOURCE-SERVER()



NAME
       disconnect-source-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Disconnects  a  specific  Source Server from Elastic Disaster Recovery.
       Data replication is stopped immediately. All AWS resources  created  by
       Elastic  Disaster  Recovery  for enabling the replication of the Source
       Server will be terminated / deleted within 90 minutes. You cannot  dis-
       connect  a Source Server if it has a Recovery Instance. If the agent on
       the Source Server has not been prevented from  communicating  with  the
       Elastic  Disaster  Recovery  service, then it will receive a command to
       uninstall itself (within approximately 10 minutes). The following prop-
       erties  of  the  SourceServer will be changed immediately: dataReplica-
       tionInfo.dataReplicationState will be set to DISCONNECTED;  The  total-
       StorageBytes  property  for each of dataReplicationInfo.replicatedDisks
       will be set to zero; dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration  and  dataReplica-
       tionInfo.lagDuration will be nullified.

SYNOPSIS
            disconnect-source-server
          --source-server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-server-id (string)
          The ID of the Source Server to disconnect.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
