DISCONNECT-RECOVERY-INSTANCE()                  DISCONNECT-RECOVERY-INSTANCE()



NAME
       disconnect-recovery-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Disconnect  a  Recovery  Instance  from Elastic Disaster Recovery. Data
       replication is stopped immediately. All AWS resources created by  Elas-
       tic  Disaster  Recovery  for  enabling  the replication of the Recovery
       Instance will be terminated / deleted within 90 minutes. If  the  agent
       on the Recovery Instance has not been prevented from communicating with
       the Elastic Disaster Recovery service, then it will receive  a  command
       to  uninstall  itself  (within approximately 10 minutes). The following
       properties of  the  Recovery  Instance  will  be  changed  immediately:
       dataReplicationInfo.dataReplicationState  will  be set to DISCONNECTED;
       The totalStorageBytes property for each  of  dataReplicationInfo.repli-
       catedDisks  will  be  set  to zero; dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration and
       dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration will be nullified.

SYNOPSIS
            disconnect-recovery-instance
          --recovery-instance-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recovery-instance-id (string)
          The ID of the Recovery Instance to disconnect.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
