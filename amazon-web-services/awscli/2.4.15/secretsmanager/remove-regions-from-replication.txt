NAME
       remove-regions-from-replication -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a  secret  that is replicated to other Regions, deletes the secret
       replicas from the Regions you specify.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            remove-regions-from-replication
          --secret-id <value>
          --remove-replica-regions <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret.

       --remove-replica-regions (list)
          The Regions of the replicas to remove.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a replica secret

       The following remove-regions-from-replication example deletes a replica
       secret  in  eu-west-3. To delete a primary secret that is replicated to
       other regions, first delete the replicas and then call delete-secret.

          aws secretsmanager remove-regions-from-replication \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --remove-replica-regions eu-west-3

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-1a2b3c",
              "ReplicationStatus": []
          }

       For more information, see Delete a replica secret in the  Secrets  Man-
       ager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the primary secret.

       ReplicationStatus -> (list)
          The status of replicas for this secret after you remove Regions.

          (structure)
              A  replication  object  consisting  of a RegionReplicationStatus
              object and includes a Region, KMSKeyId, status, and status  mes-
              sage.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where replication occurs.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Can be an ARN , Key ID , or Alias .

              Status -> (string)
                 The status can be InProgress , Failed , or InSync .

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Status  message such as "Secret with this name already exists
                 in this region ".

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that you last accessed the secret in the Region.
