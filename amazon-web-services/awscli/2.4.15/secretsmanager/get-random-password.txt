OPTIONS
       --password-length (long)
          The length of the password. If you don't include this parameter, the
          default length is 32 characters.

       --exclude-characters (string)
          A string of the characters that you don't want in the password.

       --exclude-numbers | --no-exclude-numbers (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude numbers from the password. If you don't
          include this switch, the password can contain numbers.

       --exclude-punctuation | --no-exclude-punctuation (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  exclude the following punctuation characters
          from the password: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ]
          ^  _  ` { | } ~ . If you don't include this switch, the password can
          contain punctuation.

       --exclude-uppercase | --no-exclude-uppercase (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude uppercase letters from the password. If
          you  don't  include  this switch, the password can contain uppercase
          letters.

       --exclude-lowercase | --no-exclude-lowercase (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude lowercase letters from the password. If
          you  don't  include  this switch, the password can contain lowercase
          letters.

       --include-space | --no-include-space (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include the space  character.  If  you  include
          this switch, the password can contain space characters.

       --require-each-included-type      |     --no-require-each-included-type
       (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include at least one upper and  lowercase  let-
          ter,  one  number,  and  one  punctuation. If you don't include this
          switch, the password contains at least one of every character  type.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
