DELETE-SECRET()                                                DELETE-SECRET()



NAME
       delete-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  secret  and all of its versions. You can specify a recovery
       window during which you can restore the secret.  The  minimum  recovery
       window  is 7 days. The default recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Man-
       ager attaches a DeletionDate stamp to the secret that specifies the end
       of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Man-
       ager deletes the secret permanently.

       For  information  about  deleting  a  secret  in   the   console,   see
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_delete-secret.html
       .

       Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at  the  end  of
       the  waiting period as a background task with low priority. There is no
       guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for  the  perma-
       nent delete to occur.

       At  any time before recovery window ends, you can use  RestoreSecret to
       remove the DeletionDate and cancel the deletion of the secret.

       In a secret scheduled for deletion, you  cannot  access  the  encrypted
       secret  value.  To  access  that information, first cancel the deletion
       with  RestoreSecret and then retrieve the information.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-secret
          --secret-id <value>
          [--recovery-window-in-days <value>]
          [--force-delete-without-recovery | --no-force-delete-without-recovery]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to delete.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --recovery-window-in-days (long)
          The  number  of  days from 7 to 30 that Secrets Manager waits before
          permanently deleting the secret. You can't use both  this  parameter
          and  ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery  in  the same call. If you don't use
          either, then Secrets Manager defaults to a 30 day recovery window.

       --force-delete-without-recovery  |   --no-force-delete-without-recovery
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to delete the secret without any recovery window.
          You can't use both this parameter and  RecoveryWindowInDays  in  the
          same call. If you don't use either, then Secrets Manager defaults to
          a 30 day recovery window.

          Secrets Manager performs the actual deletion  with  an  asynchronous
          background  process,  so  there  might  be  a short delay before the
          secret is permanently deleted. If you delete a secret and then imme-
          diately create a secret with the same name, use appropriate back off
          and retry logic.

          WARNING:
              Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the oper-
              ation  to  skip  the normal recovery window before the permanent
              deletion that Secrets Manager would  normally  impose  with  the
              RecoveryWindowInDays  parameter. If you delete a secret with the
              ForceDeleteWithouRecovery parameter, then you have  no  opportu-
              nity to recover the secret. You lose the secret permanently.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To delete a secret

       The  following  delete-secret example deletes a secret. You can recover
       the secret with restore-secret until the date and time in the Deletion-
       Date  response  field.  To  delete a secret that is replicated to other
       regions, first remove its  replicas  with  remove-regions-from-replica-
       tion, and then call delete-secret.

          aws secretsmanager delete-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --recovery-window-in-days 7

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "DeletionDate": 1524085349.095
          }

       Guide.

       Example 2: To delete a secret without a recovery window

       The following delete-secret example deletes a secret without a recovery
       window. Yuo can't recover this secret.

          aws secretsmanager delete-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              ----force-delete-without-recovery

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "DeletionDate": 1508750180.309
          }

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the secret.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the secret.

       DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
