       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-secret-version-ids
          --secret-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret whose versions you want to list.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of results to include in the response.

          If there are more results available, in the response,  Secrets  Man-
          ager  includes  NextToken  .  To  get the next results, call ListSe-
          cretVersionIds again with the value from NextToken .

       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates where the output should continue from,  if  a
          previous  call  did  not  show all results. To get the next results,
          call ListSecretVersionIds again with this value.

       --include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include versions of secrets that don't have any
          staging labels attached to them. Versions without staging labels are
          considered deprecated and are subject to deletion  by  Secrets  Man-
          ager.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all of the secret versions associated with a secret

       The following list-secret-version-ids example gets a list of all of the
       versions of a secret.

          aws secretsmanager list-secret-version-ids \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret

       Output:

OUTPUT
       Versions -> (list)
          A list of the versions of the secret.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains information about  one  version  of  a
              secret.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The  unique version identifier of this version of the secret.

              VersionStages -> (list)
                 An array of staging labels that are currently associated with
                 this version of the secret.

                 (string)

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that this version of the secret was last accessed.
                 Note that the resolution of this field is at the  date  level
                 and does not include the time.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time this version of the secret was created.

              KmsKeyIds -> (list)
                 The KMS keys used to encrypt the secret version.

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          Secrets Manager includes this value if there's more output available
          than what is included in the current response. This can  occur  even
          when  the  response  includes no values at all, such as when you ask
          for a filtered view of a long list. To get the  next  results,  call
          ListSecretVersionIds again with this value.

       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the secret.

       Name -> (string)
