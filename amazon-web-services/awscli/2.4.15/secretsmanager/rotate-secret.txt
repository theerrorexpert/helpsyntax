ROTATE-SECRET()                                                ROTATE-SECRET()



NAME
       rotate-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  and starts the asynchronous process of rotating the secret.

       If you include the configuration parameters,  the  operation  sets  the
       values  for  the  secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you
       don't include the configuration  parameters,  the  operation  starts  a
       rotation  with the values already stored in the secret. For more infor-
       mation about rotation, see Rotate secrets .

       To configure rotation, you include the ARN of an  Amazon  Web  Services
       Lambda  function and the schedule for the rotation. The Lambda rotation
       function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the
       credentials  on the database or service to match. After testing the new
       credentials, the function marks the new secret version with the staging
       label  AWSCURRENT  .  Then anyone who retrieves the secret gets the new
       version. For more information, see How rotation works .

       When rotation is successful, the  AWSPENDING  staging  label  might  be
       attached to the same version as the AWSCURRENT version, or it might not
       be attached to any version.

       If the AWSPENDING staging label is present but not attached to the same
       version  as  AWSCURRENT  ,  then  any  later invocation of RotateSecret
       assumes that a previous rotation  request  is  still  in  progress  and
       returns an error.

       To  run this command, you must have secretsmanager:RotateSecret permis-
       sions and lambda:InvokeFunction permissions on the  function  specified
       in the secret's metadata.

SYNOPSIS
            rotate-secret
          --secret-id <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--rotation-lambda-arn <value>]
          [--rotation-rules <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to rotate.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for the new version of  the  secret  that  helps
          ensure  idempotency.  Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the
          accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures  and
          retries during rotation. This value becomes the VersionId of the new
          version.

          If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices  SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter
          empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you  and  includes
          that in the request for this parameter. If you don't use the SDK and
          instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets  Manager  service
          endpoint,  then  you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for
          new versions and include that value in the request.

          You only need to specify this value if you implement your own  retry
          logic and you want to ensure that Secrets Manager doesn't attempt to
          create a secret version twice. We  recommend  that  you  generate  a
          UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.

       --rotation-lambda-arn (string)
          The  ARN of the Lambda rotation function that can rotate the secret.

       --rotation-rules (structure)
          A structure that defines the rotation configuration for this secret.

          AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number of days between automatic scheduled rota-
              tions of the secret.

              Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation  when  the  previous
              one  is  complete.  Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding
              the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the
              last  rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour
              date window randomly. The minute is also  chosen  somewhat  ran-
              domly,  but  weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced
              by a variety of factors that help distribute load.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AutomaticallyAfterDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AutomaticallyAfterDays": long
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To configure and start automatic rotation for a secret

       The following rotate-secret example  configures  and  starts  automatic
       rotation  for a secret. Secrets Manager rotates the secret once immedi-
       ately and then automatically every 10 days. The output shows  the  Ver-
       sionId of the new secret version created by rotation.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret \
              --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:1234566789012:function:SecretsManagerTestRotationLambda \
              --rotation-rules AutomaticallyAfterDays=10

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       ager User Guide.

       Example 2: To rotate a secret immediately

       The following rotate-secret example starts an immediate  rotation.  The
       output  shows  the VersionId of the new secret version created by rota-
       tion. The secret must already have rotation configured.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       Guide.
