VALIDATE-RESOURCE-POLICY()                          VALIDATE-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       validate-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Validates that a resource policy does not grant a wide range of princi-
       pals access to your secret. A resource-based  policy  is  optional  for
       secrets.

       The API performs three checks when validating the policy:

       o Sends  a  call  to Zelkova , an automated reasoning engine, to ensure
         your resource policy does not allow broad access to your secret,  for
         example policies that use a wildcard for the principal.

       o Checks for correct syntax in a policy.

       o Verifies the policy does not lock out a caller.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            validate-resource-policy
          [--secret-id <value>]
          --resource-policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          This field is reserved for internal use.

       --resource-policy (string)
          A  JSON-formatted  string  that  contains  an  Amazon  Web  Services
          resource-based policy. The policy in the string identifies  who  can
          access or manage this secret and its versions. For example policies,
          see Permissions policy examples .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To validate a resource policy

       The following validate-resource-policy example checks that  a  resource
       policy  doesn't grant broad access to a secret. The policy is read from
       a file on disk. For more information, see Loading  AWS  CLI  parameters
       from a file in the AWS CLI User Guide.

          aws secretsmanager validate-resource-policy \
              --resource-policy file://mypolicy.json

       Contents of mypolicy.json:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {
                          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole"
                      },
                      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                      "Resource": "*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyValidationPassed": true,
              "ValidationErrors": []
          }

       For  more information, see Permissions reference for Secrets Manager in
       the Secrets Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       PolicyValidationPassed -> (boolean)
          True if your policy passes validation, otherwise false.

       ValidationErrors -> (list)
          Validation errors if your policy didn't pass validation.

          (structure)
              Displays errors that occurred during validation of the  resource
              policy.

              CheckName -> (string)
                 Checks the name of the policy.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 Displays  error  messages  if  validation encounters problems
                 during validation of the resource policy.
