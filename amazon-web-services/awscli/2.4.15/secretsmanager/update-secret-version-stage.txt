UPDATE-SECRET-VERSION-STAGE()                    UPDATE-SECRET-VERSION-STAGE()



NAME
       update-secret-version-stage -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Secrets
       Manager uses staging labels to track a version as it progresses through
       the secret rotation process. Each staging label can be attached to only
       one version at a time. To add a staging label to a version when  it  is
       already  attached  to another version, Secrets Manager first removes it
       from the other version first and then attaches it to this one. For more
       information  about versions and staging labels, see Concepts: Version .

       The staging labels that you specify in the VersionStage  parameter  are
       added to the existing list of staging labels for the version.

       You  can move the AWSCURRENT staging label to this version by including
       it in this call.

       NOTE:
          Whenever you move AWSCURRENT , Secrets Manager  automatically  moves
          the  label  AWSPREVIOUS  to  the version that AWSCURRENT was removed
          from.

       If this action results in the last label being removed from a  version,
       then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by
       Secrets Manager.

SYNOPSIS
            update-secret-version-stage
          --secret-id <value>
          --version-stage <value>
          [--remove-from-version-id <value>]
          [--move-to-version-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or the name of the  secret  with  the  version  and  staging
          labelsto modify.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --version-stage (string)
          The staging label to add to this version.

       --remove-from-version-id (string)
          The ID of the version that the staging label is to be removed  from.
          If  the  staging  label  you  are trying to attach to one version is
          already attached to a different version, then you must include  this
          parameter  and  specify  the version that the label is to be removed
          from. If the label is attached and you either do  not  specify  this
          parameter,  or  the  version  ID  does not match, then the operation
          fails.

       --move-to-version-id (string)
          The ID of the version to add the staging label to. To remove a label
          from a version, then do not specify this parameter.

          If  the  staging label is already attached to a different version of
          the secret, then  you  must  also  specify  the  RemoveFromVersionId
          parameter.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To revert a secret to the previous version

       The  following update-secret-version-stage example moves the AWSCURRENT
       staging label to the previous version of a secret,  which  reverts  the
       secret  to  the  previous version. To find the ID for the previous ver-
       sion, use list-secret-version-ids. For this example, the  version  with
       the  AWSCURRENT  label  is a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 and the
       version with the  AWSPREVIOUS  label  is  a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAM-
       PLE22222.  In  this example, you move the AWSCURRENT label from version
       11111 to 22222. Because the AWSCURRENT label is removed from a version,
       update-secret-version-stage  automatically  moves the AWSPREVIOUS label
       to that version (11111). The effect is that the AWSCURRENT and  AWSPRE-
       VIOUS versions are swapped.

          aws secretsmanager update-secret-version-stage \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --version-stage AWSCURRENT \
              --move-to-version-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --remove-from-version-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret"
          }

       Example 2: To add a staging label attached to a version of a secret

       The  following update-secret-version-stage example adds a staging label
       to a version of a  secret.  You  can  review  the  results  by  running
       list-secret-version-ids  and  viewing  the VersionStages response field
       for the affected version.

          aws secretsmanager update-secret-version-stage \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --version-stage STAGINGLABEL1 \
              --move-to-version-id EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret"
          }

       Example 3: To delete a staging label attached to a version of a secret

       The following update-secret-version-stage  example  deletes  a  staging
       label  that  is  attached  to a version of a secret. You can review the
       results by running list-secret-version-ids  and  viewing  the  Version-
       Stages response field for the affected version.

          aws secretsmanager update-secret-version-stage \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --version-stage STAGINGLABEL1 \
              --remove-from-version-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret"
          }
