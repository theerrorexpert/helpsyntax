GET-RESOURCE-POLICY()                                    GET-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       get-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the JSON text of the resource-based policy document attached
       to the secret. For more information about permissions policies attached
       to a secret, see Permissions policies attached to a secret .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-policy
          --secret-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The   ARN   or   name   of  the  secret  to  retrieve  the  attached
          resource-based policy for.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the resource-based policy attached to a secret

       The  following get-resource-policy example retrieves the resource-based
       policy attached to a secret.

          aws secretsmanager get-resource-policy \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "ResourcePolicy": "{\n\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\":[{\n\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\n
              \"Principal\":{\n\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root\"\n},\n\"Action\":
              \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\n\"Resource\":\"*\"\n}]\n}"
          }

       Secrets Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the secret that the resource-based policy was  retrieved
          for.

       ResourcePolicy -> (string)
          A   JSON-formatted  string  that  contains  the  permissions  policy
