COPY-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                                COPY-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       copy-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies the specified automated cluster snapshot to a new manual cluster
       snapshot. The source must be an automated snapshot and it  must  be  in
       the available state.

       When  you delete a cluster, Amazon Redshift deletes any automated snap-
       shots of the cluster. Also, when the retention period of  the  snapshot
       expires,  Amazon Redshift automatically deletes it. If you want to keep
       an automated snapshot for a longer period, you can make a  manual  copy
       of the snapshot. Manual snapshots are retained until you delete them.

       For  more  information  about working with snapshots, go to Amazon Red-
       shift Snapshots in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            copy-cluster-snapshot
          --source-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--source-snapshot-cluster-identifier <value>]
          --target-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--manual-snapshot-retention-period <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the source snapshot.

          Constraints:

          o Must be the identifier for a valid automated snapshot whose  state
            is available .

       --source-snapshot-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier of the cluster the source snapshot was created from.
          This parameter is required if your IAM user has a policy  containing
          a snapshot resource element that specifies anything other than * for
          the cluster name.

          Constraints:

          o Must be the identifier for a valid cluster.

       --target-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier given to the new manual snapshot.

          Constraints:

          o Cannot be null, empty, or blank.

          o Must contain from 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          o Must be unique for the Amazon Web Services account that is  making
            the request.

       --manual-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The  number of days that a manual snapshot is retained. If the value
          is -1, the manual snapshot is retained indefinitely.

          The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.

          The default value is -1.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                as "creating".

              o DescribeClusterSnapshots returns status as "creating", "avail-
                able", "final snapshot", or "failed".

              create  or copy the snapshot. For automatic snapshots, the owner
              of the cluster. The owner can perform all snapshot actions, such
              as sharing a manual snapshot.
