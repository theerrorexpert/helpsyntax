NAME
       describe-data-shares-for-consumer -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of datashares where the account identifier being called
       is a consumer account identifier.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-data-shares-for-consumer is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DataShares

SYNOPSIS
            describe-data-shares-for-consumer
          [--consumer-arn <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --consumer-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the consumer that returns in the
          list of datashares.

       --status (string)
          An identifier giving the status of a datashare in the consumer clus-
          ter. If this field is specified, Amazon Redshift returns the list of
          datashares that have the specified status.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o AVAILABLE

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DataShares -> (list)
          Shows the results of datashares available for consumers.

          (structure)
              DataShareArn -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that references the datashare
                 that is owned by a specific namespace of the  producer  clus-
                 ter.    A    datashare    ARN    is   in   the   arn:aws:red-
                 shift:{region}:{account-id}:{datashare}:{names-
                 pace-guid}/{datashare-name} format.

              ProducerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the producer.

              AllowPubliclyAccessibleConsumers -> (boolean)
                 A value that specifies whether the datashare can be shared to
                 a publicly accessible cluster.

              DataShareAssociations -> (list)
                 A value that specifies when the datashare has an  association
                 between a producer and data consumers.

                 (structure)
                     The  association  of  a datashare from a producer account
                     with a data consumer.

                     ConsumerIdentifier -> (string)
                        The name of the consumer accounts that have an associ-
                        ation with a producer datashare.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The status of the datashare that is associated.

                     CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                        The creation date of the datashare that is associated.

                     StatusChangeDate -> (timestamp)
                        The status change data of the datashare that is  asso-
                        ciated.

              ManagedBy -> (string)
                 The identifier of a datashare to show its managing entity.

       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a
          set of response records. When the results of a   DescribeDataShares-
          ForConsumer  request exceed the value specified in MaxRecords , Ama-
          zon Web Services  returns  a  value  in  the  Marker  field  of  the
          response.  You can retrieve the next set of response records by pro-
          viding the returned marker value in the Marker parameter and  retry-
          ing the request.
