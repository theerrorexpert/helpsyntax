DESCRIBE-RESIZE()                                            DESCRIBE-RESIZE()



NAME
       describe-resize -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the last resize operation for the specified
       cluster. If no resize operation has ever been initiated for the  speci-
       fied  cluster,  a HTTP 404 error is returned. If a resize operation was
       initiated and completed, the status of the resize remains as  SUCCEEDED
       until the next resize.

       A resize operation can be requested using  ModifyCluster and specifying
       a different number or type of nodes for the cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-resize
          --cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of a cluster whose  resize  progress  you  are
          requesting. This parameter is case-sensitive.

          By default, resize operations for all clusters defined for an Amazon
          Web Services account are returned.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
   Describe Resize
       This example describes the latest resize of a cluster. The request  was
       for 3 nodes of type dw.hs1.8xlarge.

       Command:

          aws redshift describe-resize --cluster-identifier mycluster

       Result:

          {
             "Status": "NONE",
             "TargetClusterType": "multi-node",
             "TargetNodeType": "dw.hs1.8xlarge",
             "ResponseMetadata": {
                "RequestId": "9f52b0b4-7733-11e2-aa9b-318b2909bd27"
             },
             "TargetNumberOfNodes": "3"
          }

OUTPUT
       TargetNodeType -> (string)
          The  node type that the cluster will have after the resize operation
          is complete.

       TargetNumberOfNodes -> (integer)
          The number of nodes that the cluster  will  have  after  the  resize
          operation is complete.

       TargetClusterType -> (string)
          The cluster type after the resize operation is complete.

          Valid Values: multi-node | single-node

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the resize operation.

          Valid Values: NONE | IN_PROGRESS | FAILED | SUCCEEDED | CANCELLING

       ImportTablesCompleted -> (list)
          The names of tables that have been completely imported .

          Valid Values: List of table names.

          (string)

       ImportTablesInProgress -> (list)
          The names of tables that are being currently imported.

          Valid Values: List of table names.

          (string)

       ImportTablesNotStarted -> (list)
          The names of tables that have not been yet imported.

          Valid Values: List of table names

          (string)

       AvgResizeRateInMegaBytesPerSecond -> (double)
          The  average rate of the resize operation over the last few minutes,
          measured in megabytes per second. After the  resize  operation  com-
          pletes, this value shows the average rate of the entire resize oper-
          ation.

       TotalResizeDataInMegaBytes -> (long)
          The estimated total amount of data, in  megabytes,  on  the  cluster
          before the resize operation began.

       ProgressInMegaBytes -> (long)
          While the resize operation is in progress, this value shows the cur-
          rent amount of data, in megabytes, that has been processed  so  far.
          When  the  resize  operation is complete, this value shows the total
          amount of data, in megabytes, on the cluster, which may be  more  or
          less  than TotalResizeDataInMegaBytes (the estimated total amount of
          data before resize).

       ElapsedTimeInSeconds -> (long)
          The amount of seconds that have elapsed since the  resize  operation
          began.  After  the  resize operation completes, this value shows the
          total actual time, in seconds, for the resize operation.

       EstimatedTimeToCompletionInSeconds -> (long)
          The estimated time remaining, in seconds, until the resize operation
          is  complete.  This  value is calculated based on the average resize
          rate and the estimated amount of data  remaining  to  be  processed.
          Once the resize operation is complete, this value will be 0.

       ResizeType -> (string)
          An  enum  with  possible values of ClassicResize and ElasticResize .
          These values describe the type of resize operation being  performed.

       Message -> (string)
          An  optional  string  to provide additional details about the resize
          action.

       TargetEncryptionType -> (string)
          The type of encryption for the cluster after the resize is complete.

          Possible values are KMS and None .

       DataTransferProgressPercent -> (double)
          The  percent of data transferred from source cluster to target clus-
          ter.
