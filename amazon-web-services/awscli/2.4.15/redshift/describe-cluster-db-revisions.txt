NAME
       describe-cluster-db-revisions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of ClusterDbRevision objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-cluster-db-revisions  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ClusterDbRevisions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster-db-revisions
          [--cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for a cluster whose ClusterDbRevisions  you  are
          requesting.  This  parameter is case sensitive. All clusters defined
          for an account are returned by default.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe DB revisions for a cluster

       The   following   describe-cluster-db-revisions  example  displays  the
       details of an array of  ClusterDbRevision  objects  for  the  specified
       cluster.

          aws redshift describe-cluster-db-revisions \
              --cluster-identifier mycluster

       Output:

          {
              "ClusterDbRevisions": [
                  {
                      "ClusterIdentifier": "mycluster",
                      "CurrentDatabaseRevision": "11420",
                      "DatabaseRevisionReleaseDate": "2019-11-22T16:43:49.597Z",
                      "RevisionTargets": []
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A  string  representing the starting point for the next set of revi-
          sions. If a value is returned in a response, you  can  retrieve  the
          next set of revisions by providing the value in the marker parameter
          and retrying the command. If the marker field is  empty,  all  revi-
          sions have already been returned.

       ClusterDbRevisions -> (list)
          A list of revisions.

          (structure)
              Describes a ClusterDbRevision .

              ClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the cluster.

              CurrentDatabaseRevision -> (string)
                 A string representing the current cluster version.

              DatabaseRevisionReleaseDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date on which the database revision was released.

              RevisionTargets -> (list)
                 A list of RevisionTarget objects, where each object describes
                 the database revision that a cluster can be updated to.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a RevisionTarget .

                     DatabaseRevision -> (string)
                        A unique string that identifies the version to  update
                        the cluster to. You can use this value in  ModifyClus-
                        terDbRevision .

                     Description -> (string)
                        A string that describes the changes and features  that
                        will  be  applied to the cluster when it is updated to
                        the corresponding  ClusterDbRevision .

                     DatabaseRevisionReleaseDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date on which the database revision was  released.
