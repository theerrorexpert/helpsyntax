SYNOPSIS
            describe-partners
          --account-id <value>
          --cluster-identifier <value>
          [--database-name <value>]
          [--partner-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the cluster.

       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the cluster whose partner  integration  is
          being described.

       --database-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  database  whose  partner  integration  is  being
          described. If database name is not specified, then all databases  in
          the cluster are described.

       --partner-name (string)
          The  name of the partner that is being described. If partner name is
          not specified, then all partner integrations are described.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
