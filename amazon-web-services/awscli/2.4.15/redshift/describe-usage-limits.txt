DESCRIBE-USAGE-LIMITS()                                DESCRIBE-USAGE-LIMITS()



NAME
       describe-usage-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Shows usage limits on a cluster. Results are filtered based on the com-
       bination of input usage limit identifier, cluster identifier, and  fea-
       ture type parameters:

       o If  usage  limit identifier, cluster identifier, and feature type are
         not provided, then all usage limit objects for the current account in
         the current region are returned.

       o If  usage  limit identifier is provided, then the corresponding usage
         limit object is returned.

       o If cluster identifier is provided, then all usage limit  objects  for
         the specified cluster are returned.

       o If  cluster  identifier and feature type are provided, then all usage
         limit  objects  for  the  combination  of  cluster  and  feature  are
         returned.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-usage-limits  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: UsageLimits

SYNOPSIS
            describe-usage-limits
          [--usage-limit-id <value>]
          [--cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--feature-type <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-limit-id (string)
          The identifier of the usage limit to describe.

       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster for which you want to  describe  usage
          limits.

       --feature-type (string)
          The feature type for which you want to describe usage limits.

          Possible values:

          o spectrum

          o concurrency-scaling

       --tag-keys (list)
          A  tag  key  or keys for which you want to return all matching usage
          limit objects that are associated with the specified  key  or  keys.
          For  example, suppose that you have parameter groups that are tagged
          with keys called owner and environment .  If  you  specify  both  of
          these  tag  keys  in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response
          with the usage limit objects have either or both of these  tag  keys
          associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A  tag  value  or  values  for which you want to return all matching
          usage limit objects that are associated with the specified tag value
          or  values. For example, suppose that you have parameter groups that
          are tagged with values called admin and test . If you  specify  both
          of  these  tag  values  in  the  request,  Amazon Redshift returns a
          response with the usage limit objects that have either  or  both  of
          these tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UsageLimits -> (list)
          Contains the output from the  DescribeUsageLimits action.

          (structure)
              Describes a usage limit object for a cluster.

              UsageLimitId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the usage limit.

              ClusterIdentifier -> (string)

                 based on a time duration or data size.

              Amount -> (long)
                 The  limit  amount. If time-based, this amount is in minutes.
                 If data-based, this amount is in terabytes (TB).

              Period -> (string)
                 The time period that the amount applies to. A  weekly  period
                 begins on Sunday. The default is monthly .

                 A list of tag instances.

                 (structure)
                     A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key, or name, for the resource tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value for the resource tag.

       Marker -> (string)
          A value that indicates the  starting  point  for  the  next  set  of
          response  records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in
          a response, you can retrieve the next set of  records  by  providing
          this  returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the
          command. If the Marker field is empty,  all  response  records  have
          been retrieved for the request.
