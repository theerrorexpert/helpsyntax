RESIZE-CLUSTER()                                              RESIZE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       resize-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the size of the cluster. You can change the cluster's type, or
       change the number or type of nodes. The default behavior is to use  the
       elastic  resize  method. With an elastic resize, your cluster is avail-
       able for read and write operations more quickly than with  the  classic
       resize method.

       Elastic resize operations have the following restrictions:

       o You can only resize clusters of the following types:

         o dc1.large (if your cluster is in a VPC)

         o dc1.8xlarge (if your cluster is in a VPC)

         o dc2.large

         o dc2.8xlarge

         o ds2.xlarge

         o ds2.8xlarge

         o ra3.xlplus

         o ra3.4xlarge

         o ra3.16xlarge

       o The type of nodes that you add must match the node type for the clus-
         ter.

SYNOPSIS
            resize-cluster
          --cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cluster-type <value>]
          [--node-type <value>]
          [--number-of-nodes <value>]
          [--classic | --no-classic]
          [--reserved-node-id <value>]
          [--target-reserved-node-offering-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier for the cluster to resize.

       --cluster-type (string)
          The new cluster type for the specified cluster.

       --node-type (string)
          The new node type for the nodes you are adding.  If  not  specified,
          the cluster's current node type is used.

       --number-of-nodes (integer)
          The new number of nodes for the cluster. If not specified, the clus-
          ter's current number of nodes is used.

       --classic | --no-classic (boolean)
          A boolean value indicating whether the resize operation is using the
          classic  resize  process. If you don't provide this parameter or set
          the value to false , the resize type is elastic.

       --reserved-node-id (string)
          The identifier of the reserved node.

       --target-reserved-node-offering-id (string)
          The identifier of the target reserved node offering.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Clusters that are cre-
              ated in a VPC use VPC security groups, which are listed  by  the

              this cluster. Each parameter group in the list is returned  with
              its status.

                            o pending-reboot : The  parameter  value  will  be
                              applied after the cluster reboots.

                            o applying  : The parameter value is being applied
                              to the database.

                            o invalid-parameter : Cannot apply  the  parameter
                              value because it has an invalid value or syntax.

                              property changes. The changes are deferred until
                              the cluster reboots.

                            o apply-error : Cannot connect to the cluster. The
                              parameter change will be applied after the clus-
                              ter reboots.

                            o unknown-error  :  Cannot  apply  the   parameter
                              change  right  now.  The  change will be applied
                              after the cluster reboots.

                        ParameterApplyErrorDescription -> (string)
                            The error that prevented the parameter from  being
                            applied to the database.

          ClusterSubnetGroupName -> (string)
              The  name  of the subnet group that is associated with the clus-
