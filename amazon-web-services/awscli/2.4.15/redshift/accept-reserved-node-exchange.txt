ACCEPT-RESERVED-NODE-EXCHANGE()                ACCEPT-RESERVED-NODE-EXCHANGE()



NAME
       accept-reserved-node-exchange -

DESCRIPTION
       Exchanges  a  DC1 Reserved Node for a DC2 Reserved Node with no changes
       to the configuration (term, payment type, or number of  nodes)  and  no
       additional costs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            accept-reserved-node-exchange
          --reserved-node-id <value>
          --target-reserved-node-offering-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reserved-node-id (string)
          A  string  representing the node identifier of the DC1 Reserved Node
          to be exchanged.

       --target-reserved-node-offering-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the DC2 Reserved Node offering to  be  used
          for  the  exchange.  You  can  obtain the value for the parameter by
          calling  GetReservedNodeExchangeOfferings

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To accept reserved node exchange

       The following accept-reserved-node-exchange example accepts exchange of
       a DC1 reserved node for a DC2 reserved node.

          aws redshift accept-reserved-node-exchange /
              --reserved-node-id 12345678-12ab-12a1-1a2a-12ab-12a12EXAMPLE /
              --target-reserved-node-offering-id 12345678-12ab-12a1-1a2a-12ab-12a12EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "ExchangedReservedNode": {
                  "ReservedNodeId": "12345678-12ab-12a1-1a2a-12ab-12a12EXAMPLE",
