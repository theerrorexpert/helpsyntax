DESCRIBE-HSM-CLIENT-CERTIFICATES()          DESCRIBE-HSM-CLIENT-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       describe-hsm-client-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the specified HSM client certificate. If no
       certificate ID is specified, returns information about all the HSM cer-
       tificates owned by your Amazon Web Services account.

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all HSM client certificates that match any combination
       of  the  specified  keys and values. For example, if you have owner and
       environment for tag keys, and admin and test for tag  values,  all  HSM
       client  certificates  that  have  any  combination  of those values are
       returned.

       If both tag keys and values are omitted from the  request,  HSM  client
       certificates  are  returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or
       values associated with them.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-hsm-client-certificates is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: HsmClientCertificates

SYNOPSIS
            describe-hsm-client-certificates
          [--hsm-client-certificate-identifier <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hsm-client-certificate-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  a specific HSM client certificate for which you
          want information. If no  identifier  is  specified,  information  is
          returned  for  all  HSM client certificates owned by your Amazon Web
          Services account.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A tag key or keys for which you want  to  return  all  matching  HSM
          client  certificates  that  are associated with the specified key or
          keys. For example, suppose that you  have  HSM  client  certificates
          that  are  tagged  with  keys  called owner and environment . If you
          specify both of these tag  keys  in  the  request,  Amazon  Redshift
          returns a response with the HSM client certificates that have either
          or both of these tag keys associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching  HSM
          client certificates that are associated with the specified tag value
          or values. For example, suppose that you have  HSM  client  certifi-
          cates  that  are  tagged  with values called admin and test . If you
          specify both of these tag values in  the  request,  Amazon  Redshift
          returns a response with the HSM client certificates that have either
          or both of these tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A  value  that  indicates  the  starting  point  for the next set of
          response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned  in
          a  response,  you  can retrieve the next set of records by providing
          this returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying  the
          command.  If  the  Marker  field is empty, all response records have
          been retrieved for the request.

       HsmClientCertificates -> (list)
          A list of the identifiers for one or more  HSM  client  certificates
          used  by  Amazon  Redshift  clusters  to store and retrieve database
          encryption keys in an HSM.

          (structure)
              Returns information about an HSM client  certificate.  The  cer-
              tificate  is  stored  in a secure Hardware Storage Module (HSM),
              and used by the Amazon Redshift cluster to encrypt data files.

              HsmClientCertificateIdentifier -> (string)
                 The identifier of the HSM client certificate.

              HsmClientCertificatePublicKey -> (string)
                 The public key that the Amazon Redshift cluster will  use  to
                 connect  to  the HSM. You must register the public key in the
                 HSM.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The list of tags for the HSM client certificate.

                 (structure)
                     A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key, or name, for the resource tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value for the resource tag.
