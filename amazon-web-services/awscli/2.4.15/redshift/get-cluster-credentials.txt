GET-CLUSTER-CREDENTIALS()                            GET-CLUSTER-CREDENTIALS()



NAME
       get-cluster-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  database  user  name  and temporary password with temporary
       authorization to log on to an  Amazon  Redshift  database.  The  action
       returns  the  database  user  name  prefixed with IAM: if AutoCreate is
       False or IAMA: if AutoCreate is True . You can optionally  specify  one
       or  more  database  user  groups  that the user will join at log on. By
       default, the temporary credentials  expire  in  900  seconds.  You  can
       optionally specify a duration between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 3600
       seconds (60 minutes). For more information, see Using  IAM  Authentica-
       tion to Generate Database User Credentials in the Amazon Redshift Clus-
       ter Management Guide.

       The Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role  that  runs  Get-
       ClusterCredentials  must have an IAM policy attached that allows access
       to all necessary actions and resources. For more information about per-
       missions, see Resource Policies for GetClusterCredentials in the Amazon
       Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

       If the DbGroups parameter is specified, the IAM policy must  allow  the
       redshift:JoinGroup action with access to the listed dbgroups .

       In addition, if the AutoCreate parameter is set to True , then the pol-
       icy must include the redshift:CreateClusterUser privilege.

       If the DbName parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow  access
       to the resource dbname for the specified database name.

SYNOPSIS
            get-cluster-credentials
          --db-user <value>
          [--db-name <value>]
          --cluster-identifier <value>
          [--duration-seconds <value>]
          [--auto-create | --no-auto-create]
          [--db-groups <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-user (string)
          The  name  of a database user. If a user name matching DbUser exists
          in the database, the temporary user credentials have the  same  per-
          missions  as the existing user. If DbUser doesn't exist in the data-
          base and Autocreate is True , a new user is created using the  value
          for  DbUser with PUBLIC permissions. If a database user matching the
          value for DbUser doesn't exist and Autocreate is False  ,  then  the
          command  succeeds  but  the connection attempt will fail because the
          user doesn't exist in the database.

          For more information, see CREATE USER in the Amazon  Redshift  Data-
          base Developer Guide.

          Constraints:

          o Must  be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens. The user name
            can't be PUBLIC .

          o Must contain only lowercase  letters,  numbers,  underscore,  plus
            sign, period (dot), at symbol (@), or hyphen.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Must not contain a colon ( : ) or slash ( / ).

          o Cannot  be  a reserved word. A list of reserved words can be found
            in Reserved Words in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide.

       --db-name (string)
          The  name  of  a database that DbUser is authorized to log on to. If
          DbName is not specified, DbUser can log on to any existing database.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

          o Must  contain  only  lowercase  letters, numbers, underscore, plus
            sign, period (dot), at symbol (@), or hyphen.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Must not contain a colon ( : ) or slash ( / ).

          o Cannot be a reserved word. A list of reserved words can  be  found
            in Reserved Words in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide.

       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the cluster that contains the database  for
          which your are requesting credentials. This parameter is case sensi-
          tive.

       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The number of seconds until the returned temporary password expires.

          Constraint: minimum 900, maximum 3600.

          Default: 900

       --auto-create | --no-auto-create (boolean)
          Create a database user with the name specified for the user named in
          DbUser if one does not exist.

       --db-groups (list)
          A list of the names of existing database groups that the user  named
          in  DbUser  will  join  for  the current session, in addition to any
          group memberships for an existing user. If not specified, a new user
          is added only to PUBLIC.

          Database group name constraints

          o Must be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

          o Must  contain  only  lowercase  letters, numbers, underscore, plus
            sign, period (dot), at symbol (@), or hyphen.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Must not contain a colon ( : ) or slash ( / ).

          o Cannot be a reserved word. A list of reserved words can  be  found
            in Reserved Words in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get cluster credentials for an AWS account

       The following get-cluster-credentials example retrieves temporary  cre-
       dentials that enable access to an Amazon Redshift database.

          aws redshift get-cluster-credentials \
              --db-user adminuser --db-name dev \
              --cluster-identifier mycluster

       Output:

          {
              "DbUser": "IAM:adminuser",
              "DbPassword": "AMAFUyyuros/QjxPTtgzcsuQsqzIasdzJEN04aCtWDzXx1O9d6UmpkBtvEeqFly/EXAMPLE==",
              "Expiration": "2019-12-10T17:25:05.770Z"
          }

       For more information, see Generating IAM Database Credentials Using the
       Amazon Redshift CLI or API in the Amazon  Redshift  Cluster  Management
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       DbUser -> (string)
          A  database  user  name that is authorized to log on to the database
          DbName using the password  DbPassword  .  If  the  specified  DbUser
          exists  in  the  database,  the  new user name has the same database
          privileges as the the user named in DbUser. By default, the user  is
          added  to  PUBLIC.  If the DbGroups parameter is specifed, DbUser is
          added to the listed groups for any sessions created using these cre-
          dentials.

       DbPassword -> (string)
          A  temporary  password  that  authorizes  the  user name returned by
          DbUser to log on to the database DbName .

       Expiration -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the password in DbPassword expires.
