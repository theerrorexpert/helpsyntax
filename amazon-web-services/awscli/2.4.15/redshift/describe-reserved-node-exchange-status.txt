NAME
       describe-reserved-node-exchange-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns   exchange   status  details  and  associated  metadata  for  a
       reserved-node exchange. Statuses include such values as in progress and
       requested.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-reserved-node-exchange-status is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ReservedNodeExchangeStatusDetails

SYNOPSIS
            describe-reserved-node-exchange-status
          [--reserved-node-id <value>]
          [--reserved-node-exchange-request-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reserved-node-id (string)
          The identifier of  the  source  reserved  node  in  a  reserved-node
          exchange request.

       --reserved-node-exchange-request-id (string)
          The identifier of the reserved-node exchange request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The details of the reserved-node  exchange  request,  including  the
          status,  request  time,  source  reserved-node identifier, and addi-
          tional details.

          (structure)
              Reserved-node status details, such as the  source  reserved-node
              identifier,  the target reserved-node identifier, the node type,
              the node count, and other details.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the reserved-node  exchange  request.  Statuses
                 include in-progress and requested.

              RequestTime -> (timestamp)
                 A date and time that indicate when the reserved-node exchange
                 was requested.

              SourceReservedNodeId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the source reserved node.

              SourceReservedNodeType -> (string)
                 The source reserved-node type, for example ds2.xlarge.

              SourceReservedNodeCount -> (integer)
                 The source reserved-node count in the cluster.

              TargetReservedNodeOfferingId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the target reserved node offering.

              TargetReservedNodeType -> (string)
                 The node type  of  the  target  reserved  node,  for  example
                 ra3.4xlarge.

              TargetReservedNodeCount -> (integer)
                 The count of target reserved nodes in the cluster.

       Marker -> (string)
          A  pagination  token  provided by a previous DescribeReservedNodeEx-
          changeStatus request.
