GET-RESERVED-NODE-EXCHANGE-OFFERINGS()  GET-RESERVED-NODE-EXCHANGE-OFFERINGS()



NAME
       get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an array of DC2 ReservedNodeOfferings that matches the payment
       type, term, and usage price of the given DC1 reserved node.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ReservedNodeOfferings

SYNOPSIS
            get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings
          --reserved-node-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reserved-node-id (string)
          A  string representing the node identifier for the DC1 Reserved Node
          to be exchanged.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get reserved node exchange offerings

       The following get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings example retrieves an
       array  of  DC2  ReservedNodeOfferings  that  match  the  specified  DC1
       reserved node.

          aws redshift get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings \
              --reserved-node-id 12345678-12ab-12a1-1a2a-12ab-12a12EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "ReservedNodeOfferings": [
                  {
                      "ReservedNodeOfferingId": "12345678-12ab-12a1-1a2a-12ab-12a12EXAMPLE",
                      "NodeType": "dc2.large",
                      "Duration": 31536000,
                      "FixedPrice": 0.0,
                      "UsagePrice": 0.0,
                      "CurrencyCode": "USD",
                      "OfferingType": "All Upfront",
                      "RecurringCharges": [
                          {
                              "RecurringChargeAmount": 0.0,
                              "RecurringChargeFrequency": "Hourly"
                          }
                      ],
                      "ReservedNodeOfferingType": "Regular"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional parameter that specifies the starting point for  return-
          ing  a  set  of  response  records.  When  the  results  of a GetRe-
          servedNodeExchangeOfferings request exceed the  value  specified  in
          MaxRecords,  Amazon  Redshift returns a value in the marker field of
          the response. You can retrieve the next set of response  records  by
          providing  the  returned  marker  value  in the marker parameter and
          retrying the request.

       ReservedNodeOfferings -> (list)
          Returns an array of  ReservedNodeOffering objects.

                 the node.

              FixedPrice -> (double)
                 The  upfront  fixed  charge you will pay to purchase the spe-
                 cific reserved node offering.

                 The rate you are charged for each hour the  cluster  that  is
                 using the offering is running.

              CurrencyCode -> (string)
                 The currency code for the compute nodes offering.

              OfferingType -> (string)
                 The  anticipated utilization of the reserved node, as defined
                 in the reserved node offering.
