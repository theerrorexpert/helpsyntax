NAME
       purchase-reserved-node-offering -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  you to purchase reserved nodes. Amazon Redshift offers a prede-
       fined set of reserved node offerings. You can purchase one or  more  of
       the  offerings.  You can call the  DescribeReservedNodeOfferings API to
       obtain the available reserved node offerings. You can call this API  by
       providing a specific reserved node offering and the number of nodes you
       want to reserve.

       For more information about reserved node offerings,  go  to  Purchasing
       Reserved Nodes in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            purchase-reserved-node-offering
          --reserved-node-offering-id <value>
          [--node-count <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reserved-node-offering-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the reserved node offering you want to pur-
          chase.

       --node-count (integer)
          The number of reserved nodes that you want to purchase.

          Default: 1

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
   Purchase a Reserved Node
       This example shows how  to  purchase  a  reserved  node  offering.  The
       reserved-node-offering-id       is       obtained       by      calling
       describe-reserved-node-offerings.

       Command:

          aws redshift purchase-reserved-node-offering --reserved-node-offering-id ceb6a579-cf4c-4343-be8b-d832c45ab51c

       Result:
