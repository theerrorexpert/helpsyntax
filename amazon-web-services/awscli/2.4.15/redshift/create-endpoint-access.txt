DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Redshift-managed VPC endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-endpoint-access
          [--cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--resource-owner <value>]
          --endpoint-name <value>
          --subnet-group-name <value>
          [--vpc-security-group-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the cluster to access.

       --resource-owner (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner of the cluster. This
          is only required if the cluster is in another  Amazon  Web  Services
          account.

       --endpoint-name (string)
          The Redshift-managed VPC endpoint name.

          An  endpoint name must contain 1-30 characters. Valid characters are
          A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and hyphen(-). The first character must be a  letter.
          The name can't contain two consecutive hyphens or end with a hyphen.

       --subnet-group-name (string)
          The subnet group from which Amazon Redshift chooses  the  subnet  to
          deploy the endpoint.

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          The  security  group  that defines the ports, protocols, and sources
          for inbound traffic that you are authorizing into your endpoint.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
