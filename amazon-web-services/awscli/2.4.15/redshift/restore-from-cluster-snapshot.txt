RESTORE-FROM-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                RESTORE-FROM-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       restore-from-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new cluster from a snapshot. By default, Amazon Redshift cre-
       ates the resulting cluster with the same configuration as the  original
       cluster  from which the snapshot was created, except that the new clus-
       ter is created with the default cluster security and parameter  groups.
       After Amazon Redshift creates the cluster, you can use the  ModifyClus-
       ter API to associate a different security group and different parameter
       group  with  the restored cluster. If you are using a DS node type, you
       can also choose to change to another DS node type of the same size dur-
       ing restore.

       If  you restore a cluster into a VPC, you must provide a cluster subnet
       group where you want the cluster restored.

       For more information about working with snapshots, go  to  Amazon  Red-
       shift Snapshots in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

            account.

       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  name of the snapshot from which to create the new cluster. This
          parameter isn't case sensitive.

          Example: my-snapshot-id

       --snapshot-cluster-identifier (string)
          The name of the cluster the source snapshot was created  from.  This
          parameter  is  required  if  your IAM user has a policy containing a
          snapshot resource element that specifies anything other than  *  for
          the cluster name.

       --port (integer)
          The port number on which the cluster accepts connections.

          Default: The same port as the original cluster.

          Constraints: Must be between 1115 and 65535 .

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Amazon EC2 Availability Zone in which to restore the cluster.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone.

          you own the snapshot.

       --hsm-client-certificate-identifier (string)
          Specifies the name of the HSM client certificate the Amazon Redshift
          cluster uses to retrieve the data encryption keys stored in an  HSM.

       --hsm-configuration-identifier (string)
          Specifies the name of the HSM configuration that contains the infor-
          mation the Amazon Redshift cluster can use  to  retrieve  and  store
          keys in an HSM.

          The elastic IP (EIP) address for the cluster.

       --cluster-parameter-group-name (string)
          The  name of the parameter group to be associated with this cluster.

          Default: The default Amazon Redshift cluster  parameter  group.  For
          information  about  the  default parameter group, go to Working with
          Amazon Redshift Parameter Groups .

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          ter.

          VPC security groups only apply to clusters in VPCs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The weekly time range (in UTC) during which automated cluster  main-
          tenance can occur.

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          Default:  The value selected for the cluster from which the snapshot
          was taken. For more information  about  the  time  blocks  for  each
          region,  see  Maintenance Windows in Amazon Redshift Cluster Manage-
          ment Guide.

          Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

          Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.

       --automated-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days that automated snapshots  are  retained.  If  the
          value  is  0,  automated  snapshots  are disabled. Even if automated
          snapshots are disabled, you can still create manual  snapshots  when
          you want with  CreateClusterSnapshot .

          You  can't  disable  automated snapshots for RA3 node types. Set the
          automated retention period from 1-35 days.

          Default: The value selected for the cluster from which the  snapshot
          was taken.

          Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35.

       --manual-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The default number of days to retain a manual snapshot. If the value
          is -1, the snapshot is retained indefinitely. This  setting  doesn't
          change the retention period of existing snapshots.

          The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  Key  Management Service (KMS) key ID of the encryption key that
          you want to use to encrypt data in the cluster that you restore from
          a shared snapshot.

       --node-type (string)
          The node type that the restored cluster will be provisioned with.

          Default:  The  node  type of the cluster from which the snapshot was
          taken. You can modify this if you are using any  DS  node  type.  In
          that  case,  you  can choose to restore into another DS node type of
          the same  size.  For  example,  you  can  restore  ds1.8xlarge  into
          ds2.8xlarge,  or  ds1.xlarge  into  ds2.xlarge.  If  you  have  a DC
          instance type, you must restore into that  same  instance  type  and
          size. In other words, you can only restore a dc1.large instance type
          into another dc1.large instance type or dc2.large instance type. You
          can't  restore  dc1.8xlarge  to  dc2.8xlarge.  First  restore  to  a
          dc1.8xlarge cluster, then resize to a dc2.8large cluster.  For  more
          information  about  node  types, see About Clusters and Nodes in the
          Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       --enhanced-vpc-routing | --no-enhanced-vpc-routing (boolean)
          An option that specifies whether to create the cluster with enhanced
          VPC  routing  enabled.  To  create  a cluster that uses enhanced VPC
          routing, the cluster must be in a VPC.  For  more  information,  see
          Enhanced  VPC  Routing  in  the  Amazon  Redshift Cluster Management
          Guide.

          If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

          Default: false

       --additional-info (string)
          Reserved.

       --iam-roles (list)
          A list of Identity and Access Management (IAM)  roles  that  can  be
          used  by  the  cluster to access other Amazon Web Services services.
          You must supply the IAM roles in their Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)
          format. You can supply up to 10 IAM roles in a single request.

          A cluster can have up to 10 IAM roles associated at any time.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --maintenance-track-name (string)
          The name of the maintenance track for the restored cluster. When you
          take a snapshot, the snapshot inherits  the  MaintenanceTrack  value
          from  the  cluster.  The snapshot might be on a different track than
          the cluster that was the source for the snapshot. For example,  sup-
          pose  that  you  take a snapshot of a cluster that is on the current
          track and then change the cluster to be on the  trailing  track.  In
          this  case,  the  snapshot  and  the source cluster are on different
          tracks.

       --snapshot-schedule-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for the snapshot schedule.

       --number-of-nodes (integer)
          The number of nodes specified when provisioning the  restored  clus-
          ter.

       --availability-zone-relocation    |   --no-availability-zone-relocation
       (boolean)
          The option to enable  relocation  for  an  Amazon  Redshift  cluster
          between Availability Zones after the cluster is restored.

       --aqua-configuration-status (string)
          The  value  represents  how  the  cluster  is configured to use AQUA
          (Advanced Query Accelerator) after the cluster is restored. Possible
          values include the following.

          o enabled  -  Use AQUA if it is available for the current Amazon Web
            Services Region and Amazon Redshift node type.

          o disabled - Don't use AQUA.

          o auto - Amazon Redshift determines whether to use AQUA.

          Possible values:

          o enabled

          o disabled

          o auto

       --default-iam-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM  role  that  was  set  as
          default  for the cluster when the cluster was last modified while it
          was restored from a snapshot.

       --reserved-node-id (string)
          The identifier of the target reserved node offering.

       --target-reserved-node-offering-id (string)
          The identifier of the target reserved node offering.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
