MODIFY-USAGE-LIMIT()                                      MODIFY-USAGE-LIMIT()



NAME
       modify-usage-limit -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a usage limit in a cluster. You can't modify the feature type
       or period of a usage limit.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-usage-limit
          --usage-limit-id <value>
          [--amount <value>]
          [--breach-action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-limit-id (string)
          The identifier of the usage limit to modify.

       --amount (long)
          The new limit amount. For more information about this parameter, see
          UsageLimit .

       --breach-action (string)
          The new action that Amazon Redshift takes when the limit is reached.
          For more information about this parameter, see  UsageLimit .

          Possible values:

          o log

          o emit-metric

          o disable

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UsageLimitId -> (string)
          The identifier of the usage limit.

       ClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          The identifier of the cluster with a usage limit.

       FeatureType -> (string)
          The Amazon Redshift feature to which the limit applies.

       LimitType -> (string)
          The type of limit. Depending on the feature type, this can be  based
          on a time duration or data size.

       Amount -> (long)
          The  limit  amount.  If  time-based,  this  amount is in minutes. If
          data-based, this amount is in terabytes (TB).

       Period -> (string)
          The time period that the amount applies to. A weekly  period  begins
          on Sunday. The default is monthly .

       BreachAction -> (string)
          The  action  that  Amazon  Redshift takes when the limit is reached.

          o emit-metric - To emit CloudWatch metrics.

          o disable - To disable the  feature  until  the  next  usage  period
            begins.

       Tags -> (list)
          A list of tag instances.

          (structure)
              A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key, or name, for the resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the resource tag.
