NAME
       describe-scheduled-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes properties of scheduled actions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-scheduled-actions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ScheduledActions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-scheduled-actions
          [--scheduled-action-name <value>]
          [--target-action-type <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--active | --no-active]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scheduled-action-name (string)
          The name of the scheduled action to retrieve.

       --target-action-type (string)
          The type of the scheduled actions to retrieve.

          Possible values:

          o ResizeCluster

          o PauseCluster

          o ResumeCluster

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time in UTC of the scheduled  actions  to  retrieve.  Only
          active  scheduled  actions that have invocations after this time are
          retrieved.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time in UTC of the scheduled action to retrieve. Only active
          scheduled  actions  that  have  invocations  before  this  time  are
          retrieved.

       --active | --no-active (boolean)
          If true, retrieve only active scheduled actions. If false,  retrieve
          only disabled scheduled actions.

       --filters (list)
          List of scheduled action filters.

          (structure)
              A set of elements to filter the returned scheduled actions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The type of element to filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 List of values. Compare if the value (of type defined by Name
                 ) equals an item in the list of scheduled actions.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "cluster-identifier"|"iam-role",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Output:

          {
              "ScheduledActions": [
                  {
                      "ScheduledActionName": "resizecluster",
                      "TargetAction": {
                          "ResizeCluster": {
                              "ClusterIdentifier": "mycluster",

              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return  a
          set of response records. When the results of a  DescribeScheduledAc-
          tions request exceed the value specified in MaxRecords , Amazon  Web
          Services  returns  a  value in the Marker field of the response. You
          can retrieve the next set  of  response  records  by  providing  the
          returned  marker  value  in  the  Marker  parameter and retrying the
          request.

       ScheduledActions -> (list)
          List of retrieved scheduled actions.

          (structure)
              Describes a scheduled action. You can use a scheduled action  to
              trigger  some  Amazon Redshift API operations on a schedule. For
              information about which API operations  can  be  scheduled,  see
              ScheduledActionType .

                 The name of the scheduled action.

              TargetAction -> (structure)
                 A  JSON  format  string  of the Amazon Redshift API operation
                 with input parameters.

                 "{\"ResizeCluster\":{\"NodeType\":\"ds2.8xlarge\",\"ClusterI-
                 dentifier\":\"my-test-cluster\",\"NumberOfNodes\":3}} ".

                 ResizeCluster -> (structure)
                     An action that runs a ResizeCluster API operation.

                     ClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the cluster to resize.

                     ClusterType -> (string)
                        The new cluster type for the specified cluster.

                     NodeType -> (string)
                        The new node type for the nodes you are adding. If not
                        specified, the cluster's current node type is used.

                     NumberOfNodes -> (integer)
                        The new number of nodes for the cluster. If not speci-
                        fied, the cluster's current number of nodes is used.

                     Classic -> (boolean)
                        A  boolean  value indicating whether the resize opera-
                        tion is using the classic resize process. If you don't
                        provide this parameter or set the value to false , the
                        resize type is elastic.

                     ReservedNodeId -> (string)
                        The identifier of the reserved node.

                     TargetReservedNodeOfferingId -> (string)

                 The schedule for a one-time (at format)  or  recurring  (cron
                 format)  scheduled action. Schedule invocations must be sepa-
                 rated by at least one hour.

                 Format of at expressions is "at(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss)  ".  For
                 example, "at(2016-03-04T17:27:00) ".

                 role  must  have  permission  to  run the Amazon Redshift API
                 operation in the scheduled action. This IAM role  must  allow
                 the   Amazon  Redshift  scheduler  (Principal  scheduler.red-
                 shift.amazonaws.com) to assume permissions  on  your  behalf.

              NextInvocations -> (list)
                 List of times when the scheduled action will run.

                 (timestamp)

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start time in UTC when the  schedule  is  active.  Before
                 this time, the scheduled action does not trigger.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  end  time  in UTC when the schedule is no longer active.
                 After this time, the scheduled action does not trigger.
