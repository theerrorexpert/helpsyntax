       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-data-share-consumer
          --data-share-arn <value>
          [--disassociate-entire-account | --no-disassociate-entire-account]
          [--consumer-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --data-share-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the datashare to  remove  associa-
          tion for.

       --disassociate-entire-account     |    --no-disassociate-entire-account
       (boolean)
          A value that specifies whether  association  for  the  datashare  is
          removed from the entire account.

       --consumer-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the consumer that association for
          the datashare is removed from.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
