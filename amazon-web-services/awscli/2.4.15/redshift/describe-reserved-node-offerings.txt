NAME
       describe-reserved-node-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of the available reserved node offerings by Amazon Red-
       shift with their descriptions including the node type,  the  fixed  and
       recurring  costs  of  reserving  the node and duration the node will be
       reserved for you. These descriptions help you determine  which  reserve
       node offering you want to purchase. You then use the unique offering ID
       in you call to  PurchaseReservedNodeOffering to  reserve  one  or  more
       nodes for your Amazon Redshift cluster.

       For  more  information  about reserved node offerings, go to Purchasing
       Reserved Nodes in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-reserved-node-offerings is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ReservedNodeOfferings

SYNOPSIS
            describe-reserved-node-offerings
          [--reserved-node-offering-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reserved-node-offering-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the offering.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A value that indicates the  starting  point  for  the  next  set  of
          response  records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in
          a response, you can retrieve the next set of  records  by  providing
          this  returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the
          command. If the Marker field is empty,  all  response  records  have
          been retrieved for the request.

       ReservedNodeOfferings -> (list)
          A list of ReservedNodeOffering objects.

                 The offering identifier.

              NodeType -> (string)
                 The node type offered by the reserved node offering.

              Duration -> (integer)

                 the node.

              FixedPrice -> (double)
                 The upfront fixed charge you will pay to  purchase  the  spe-

              CurrencyCode -> (string)
                 The currency code for the compute nodes offering.

              OfferingType -> (string)
