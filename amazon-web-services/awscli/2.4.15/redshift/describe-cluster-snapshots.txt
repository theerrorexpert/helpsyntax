DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOTS()                      DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOTS()



NAME
       describe-cluster-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns one or more snapshot objects, which contain metadata about your
       cluster snapshots. By default, this operation returns information about
       all  snapshots  of  all clusters that are owned by your Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account. No information is returned for snapshots owned by  inac-
       tive Amazon Web Services accounts.

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all snapshots that match any combination of the speci-
       fied  keys  and  values. For example, if you have owner and environment
       for tag keys, and admin and test for tag  values,  all  snapshots  that
       have  any combination of those values are returned. Only snapshots that
       you own are returned in the response; shared snapshots are not returned
       with the tag key and tag value request parameters.

       If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, snapshots are
       returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values  associated
       with them.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-cluster-snapshots is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Snapshots

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster which generated  the  requested  snap-
          shots.

       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The snapshot identifier of the snapshot about which to return infor-
          mation.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of snapshots for which you are requesting  information.  By
          default, snapshots of all types are returned.

          Valid Values: automated | manual

       --start-time (timestamp)
          A  value that requests only snapshots created at or after the speci-
          fied time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format. For  more
          information about ISO 8601, go to the ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2012-07-16T18:00:00Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          A  time  value that requests only snapshots created at or before the
          specified time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format.  For
          more information about ISO 8601, go to the ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2012-07-16T18:00:00Z

       --owner-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account used to create or copy the snapshot.
          Use this field to filter the results to snapshots owned by a partic-
          ular  account.  To  describe  snapshots you own, either specify your
          Amazon Web Services account, or do not specify the parameter.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching  cluster
          snapshots  that  are  associated with the specified key or keys. For
          example, suppose that you have snapshots that are tagged  with  keys
          called owner and environment . If you specify both of these tag keys
          in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response  with  the  snap-
          shots  that  have  either  or both of these tag keys associated with
          them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you  want  to  return  all  matching
          cluster  snapshots  that are associated with the specified tag value
          or values. For example, suppose that you  have  snapshots  that  are
          tagged  with  values  called admin and test . If you specify both of
          these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a  response
          with  the  snapshots  that  have  either or both of these tag values
          associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cluster-exists | --no-cluster-exists (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether  to  return  snapshots  only  for  an
          existing  cluster. You can perform table-level restore only by using
          a snapshot of an existing cluster, that is, a cluster that  has  not
          been deleted. Values for this parameter work as follows:

          o If ClusterExists is set to true , ClusterIdentifier is required.

          o If ClusterExists is set to false and ClusterIdentifier isn't spec-
            ified, all snapshots associated with  deleted  clusters  (orphaned
            snapshots) are returned.

          o If  ClusterExists  is set to false and ClusterIdentifier is speci-
            fied for a deleted cluster, snapshots associated with that cluster
            are returned.

          o If  ClusterExists  is set to false and ClusterIdentifier is speci-
            fied for an existing cluster, no snapshots are returned.

       --sorting-entities (list)
          (structure)
              Describes a sorting entity

              Attribute -> (string)
                 The category for sorting the snapshots.

              SortOrder -> (string)
                 The order for listing the attributes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attribute=string,SortOrder=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Attribute": "SOURCE_TYPE"|"TOTAL_SIZE"|"CREATE_TIME",
              "SortOrder": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A value that indicates the  starting  point  for  the  next  set  of
          response  records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in
          a response, you can retrieve the next set of  records  by  providing
          this  returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the
          command. If the Marker field is empty,  all  response  records  have
          been retrieved for the request.

       Snapshots -> (list)
          A list of  Snapshot instances.

              Status -> (string)
                 The snapshot status. The value of the status depends  on  the
                 API operation used:

                 o CreateClusterSnapshot and  CopyClusterSnapshot returns sta-
                   tus as "creating".

                 o DescribeClusterSnapshots  returns  status  as   "creating",
                   "available", "final snapshot", or "failed".

                 o DeleteClusterSnapshot returns status as "deleted".

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  VPC  identifier of the cluster if the snapshot is from a
                 cluster in a VPC. Otherwise, this field is not in the output.

              Encrypted -> (boolean)
                 If true , the data in the snapshot is encrypted at rest.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Key Management Service (KMS) key ID of the encryption key
                 that was used to encrypt data in the cluster from  which  the
                 snapshot was taken.

              EncryptedWithHSM -> (boolean)
                 A  boolean  that  indicates  whether  the  snapshot  data  is
                 encrypted using the HSM keys  of  the  source  cluster.  true
                 indicates that the data is encrypted using HSM keys.

                        Web  Services  Support,  the identifier is amazon-red-
                        shift-support .

              OwnerAccount -> (string)
                 For manual snapshots, the Amazon Web Services account used to
                 create  or  copy  the  snapshot. For automatic snapshots, the

                 (string)

              EnhancedVpcRouting -> (boolean)
                 An option that specifies whether to create the  cluster  with
                 enhanced  VPC  routing enabled. To create a cluster that uses
                 enhanced VPC routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For  more
                 information,  see Enhanced VPC Routing in the Amazon Redshift
                 Cluster Management Guide.

                 If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

              MaintenanceTrackName -> (string)
                 The name of the maintenance track for the snapshot.

              ManualSnapshotRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
                 The number of days that a manual snapshot is retained. If the
                 value is -1, the manual snapshot is retained indefinitely.

                 The  value  must  be  either  -1  or an integer between 1 and
                 3,653.

              ManualSnapshotRemainingDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days until a  manual  snapshot  will  pass  its
                 retention period.

              SnapshotRetentionStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  representing  the start of the retention period
                 for the snapshot.
