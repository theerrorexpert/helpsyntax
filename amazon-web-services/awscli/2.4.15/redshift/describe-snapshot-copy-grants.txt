NAME
       describe-snapshot-copy-grants -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of snapshot copy grants owned by the Amazon Web Services
       account in the destination region.

       For more information about managing snapshot copy grants, go to  Amazon
       Redshift  Database Encryption in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management
       Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-snapshot-copy-grants is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: SnapshotCopyGrants

SYNOPSIS
            describe-snapshot-copy-grants
          [--snapshot-copy-grant-name <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-copy-grant-name (string)
          The name of the snapshot copy grant.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A  tag  key  or  keys  for  which  you  want  to return all matching
          resources that are associated with the specified key  or  keys.  For
          example,  suppose  that  you  have resources tagged with keys called
          owner and environment . If you specify both of these tag keys in the
          request,  Amazon Redshift returns a response with all resources that
          have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you  want  to  return  all  matching
          resources  that  are  associated with the specified value or values.
          For example, suppose that you  have  resources  tagged  with  values
          called  admin  and test . If you specify both of these tag values in
          the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with  all  resources
          that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe snapshot copy grants

       The following describe-snapshot-copy-grants  example  displays  details
       for the specified cluster snapshot copy grant.

          aws redshift describe-snapshot-copy-grants \
              --snapshot-copy-grant-name mysnapshotcopygrantname

       Output:

          {
              "SnapshotCopyGrants": [
                  {
                      "SnapshotCopyGrantName": "mysnapshotcopygrantname",
                      "KmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/bPxRfih3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY",
                      "Tags": []
                  }
              ]
          }

       Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return  a
          set of response records. When the results of a DescribeSnapshotCopy-
          Grant request exceed the value specified in MaxRecords , Amazon  Web
          Services  returns  a  value in the Marker field of the response. You
          can retrieve the next set  of  response  records  by  providing  the
          returned  marker  value  in  the  Marker  parameter and retrying the
          request.

          Constraints: You can specify either the SnapshotCopyGrantName param-
          eter or the Marker parameter, but not both.

       SnapshotCopyGrants -> (list)
          The list of SnapshotCopyGrant objects.

          (structure)
              The  snapshot  copy grant that grants Amazon Redshift permission
              to encrypt copied snapshots with the specified  customer  master
              key  (CMK)  from  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  in the destination
              region.

              Amazon Redshift Database Encryption in the Amazon Redshift Clus-
              ter Management Guide .

              SnapshotCopyGrantName -> (string)
                 The name of the snapshot copy grant.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the customer  master  key  (CMK)  in
                 Amazon  Web  Services KMS to which Amazon Redshift is granted
                 permission.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tag instances.

                 (structure)
                     A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key, or name, for the resource tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value for the resource tag.
