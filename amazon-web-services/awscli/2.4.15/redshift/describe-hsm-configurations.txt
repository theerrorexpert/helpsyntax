DESCRIBE-HSM-CONFIGURATIONS()                    DESCRIBE-HSM-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       describe-hsm-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about the specified Amazon Redshift HSM configura-
       tion. If no configuration ID is specified,  returns  information  about
       all the HSM configurations owned by your Amazon Web Services account.

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all HSM connections that match any combination of  the
       specified  keys and values. For example, if you have owner and environ-
       ment for tag keys, and admin and test for tag values, all  HSM  connec-
       tions that have any combination of those values are returned.

       If  both  tag keys and values are omitted from the request, HSM connec-
       tions are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys  or  values
       associated with them.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-hsm-configurations  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: HsmConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            describe-hsm-configurations
          [--hsm-configuration-identifier <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hsm-configuration-identifier (string)
          The identifier of a specific Amazon Redshift HSM configuration to be
          described.  If  no  identifier is specified, information is returned
          for all  HSM  configurations  owned  by  your  Amazon  Web  Services
          account.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching HSM con-
          figurations that are associated with the specified key or keys.  For
          example,  suppose  that  you have HSM configurations that are tagged
          with keys called owner and environment .  If  you  specify  both  of
          these  tag  keys  in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response
          with the HSM configurations that have either or both  of  these  tag
          keys associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A  tag value or values for which you want to return all matching HSM
          configurations that are associated with the specified tag  value  or
          values.  For  example, suppose that you have HSM configurations that
          are tagged with values called admin and test . If you  specify  both
          of  these  tag  values  in  the  request,  Amazon Redshift returns a
          response with the HSM configurations that have  either  or  both  of
          these tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe HSM configurations

       The following describe-hsm-configurations example displays details  for
       the available HSM configurations for the calling AWS account.

          aws redshift describe-hsm-configurations /
              --hsm-configuration-identifier myhsmconnection

       Output:

          {
              "HsmConfigurations": [
                  {
                      "HsmConfigurationIdentifier": "myhsmconnection",
                      "Description": "My HSM connection",
                      "HsmIpAddress": "192.0.2.09",
                      "HsmPartitionName": "myhsmpartition",
                      "Tags": []
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A  value  that  indicates  the  starting  point  for the next set of
          response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned  in
          a  response,  you  can retrieve the next set of records by providing
          this returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying  the
          command.  If  the  Marker  field is empty, all response records have
          been retrieved for the request.

       HsmConfigurations -> (list)
          A list of HsmConfiguration objects.

          (structure)
              Returns information about an  HSM  configuration,  which  is  an
              object  that  describes to Amazon Redshift clusters the informa-
              tion they require to connect to an  HSM  where  they  can  store
              database encryption keys.

              HsmConfigurationIdentifier -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Redshift HSM configuration.

              Description -> (string)
                 A text description of the HSM configuration.

              HsmIpAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP  address that the Amazon Redshift cluster must use to
                 access the HSM.

              HsmPartitionName -> (string)
                 The name of the partition in the HSM where  the  Amazon  Red-
                 shift clusters will store their database encryption keys.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The list of tags for the HSM configuration.

                 (structure)
                     A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key, or name, for the resource tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value for the resource tag.
