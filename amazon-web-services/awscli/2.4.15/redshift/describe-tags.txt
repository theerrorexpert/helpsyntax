DESCRIBE-TAGS()                                                DESCRIBE-TAGS()



NAME
       describe-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of tags. You can return tags from a specific resource by
       specifying an ARN, or you can return all  tags  for  a  given  type  of
       resource, such as clusters, snapshots, and so on.

       The following are limitations for DescribeTags :

       o You  cannot  specify an ARN and a resource-type value together in the
         same request.

       o You cannot use the MaxRecords and Marker parameters together with the
         ARN parameter.

       o The  MaxRecords  parameter  can  be  a range from 10 to 50 results to
         return in a request.

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all resources that match any combination of the speci-
       fied keys and values. For example, if you have  owner  and  environment
       for  tag  keys,  and  admin and test for tag values, all resources that
       have any combination of those values are returned.

       If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, resources are
       returned  regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated
       with them.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-tags is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: TaggedResources

            describe-tags
          [--resource-name <value>]
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-name (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for which you want to describe the
          tag or tags. For example, arn:aws:redshift:us-east-2:123456789:clus-
          ter:t1 .

       --resource-type (string)
          The  type  of  resource  with  which  you  want  to view tags. Valid
          resource types are:

          o Cluster

          o CIDR/IP

          o EC2 security group

          o Snapshot

          o Cluster security group

          o Subnet group

          o HSM connection

          o HSM certificate

          o Parameter group

          o Snapshot copy grant

          For more information about Amazon Redshift resource types  and  con-
          structing  ARNs, go to Specifying Policy Elements: Actions, Effects,
          Resources, and Principals in the Amazon Redshift Cluster  Management
          Guide.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A  tag  key  or  keys  for  which  you  want  to return all matching
          resources that are associated with the specified key  or  keys.  For
          example,  suppose  that  you  have resources tagged with keys called
          owner and environment . If you specify both of these tag keys in the
          request,  Amazon Redshift returns a response with all resources that
          have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you  want  to  return  all  matching
          resources  that  are  associated with the specified value or values.
          For example, suppose that you  have  resources  tagged  with  values
          called  admin  and test . If you specify both of these tag values in
          the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with  all  resources
          that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe tags

       The following describe-tags example displays the resources  the  speci-
       fied cluster associated with the specified tag names and values.

          aws redshift describe-tags \
              --resource-name arn:aws:redshift:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:mycluster \
              --tag-keys clustertagkey \
              --tag-values clustertagvalue

       Output:

          {
              "TaggedResources": [
                              {
                      "Tag": {
                          "Key": "clustertagkey",
                          "Value": "clustertagvalue"
                      },
                      "ResourceName": "arn:aws:redshift:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:mycluster",
                      "ResourceType": "cluster"
                  }
              ]
          }

          A list of tags with their associated resources.

          (structure)
              A tag and its associated resource.

              Tag -> (structure)
                 The tag for the resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key, or name, for the resource tag.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the resource tag.

              ResourceName -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with which the tag is  associ-
                 ated, for example: arn:aws:redshift:us-east-2:123456789:clus-
                 ter:t1 .

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource with which the tag is associated.  Valid
                 resource types are:

                 o Cluster

                 o CIDR/IP

                 constructing ARNs, go to Constructing an Amazon Redshift Ama-
                 zon  Resource  Name (ARN) in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Man-
                 agement Guide.

       Marker -> (string)
          A value that indicates the  starting  point  for  the  next  set  of
          response  records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in
          a response, you can retrieve the next set of  records  by  providing
          this  returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the
          command. If the Marker field is empty,  all  response  records  have
          been retrieved for the request.
