NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an endpoint authorization.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-endpoint-authorization  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: EndpointAuthorizationList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint-authorization
          [--cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--account <value>]
          [--grantee | --no-grantee]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the cluster to access.

       --account (string)
          The AAmazon Web Services account ID  of  either  the  cluster  owner
          (grantor) or grantee. If Grantee parameter is true, then the Account
          value is of the grantor.

       --grantee | --no-grantee (boolean)
          Indicates whether to check authorization from a grantor  or  grantee
          point  of view. If true, Amazon Redshift returns endpoint authoriza-
          tions that you've been granted. If false  (default),  checks  autho-
          rization from a grantor point of view.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointAuthorizationList -> (list)
          The authorizations to an endpoint.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  endpoint  authorization  for   authorizing   Red-
              shift-managed VPC endpoint access to a cluster across Amazon Web
              Services accounts.

              Grantor -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID of the cluster owner.

              Grantee -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID  of  the  grantee  of  the
                 cluster.

              ClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The cluster identifier.

              AuthorizeTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time (UTC) when the authorization was created.

              ClusterStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the cluster.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the authorization action.

              AllowedAllVPCs -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether all VPCs in the grantee account are allowed
                 access to the cluster.

              AllowedVPCs -> (list)
                 The VPCs allowed access to the cluster.

                 (string)

              EndpointCount -> (integer)
                 The number of Redshift-managed VPC endpoints created for  the
                 authorization.

       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional  pagination  token  provided by a previous DescribeEnd-
          pointAuthorization request. If  this  parameter  is  specified,  the
          response  includes  only  records beyond the marker, up to the value
          specified by the MaxRecords parameter.
