REVOKE-SNAPSHOT-ACCESS()                              REVOKE-SNAPSHOT-ACCESS()



NAME
       revoke-snapshot-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the  ability  of  the specified Amazon Web Services account to
       restore the specified snapshot. If the account is  currently  restoring
       the snapshot, the restore will run to completion.

       For  more  information  about working with snapshots, go to Amazon Red-
       shift Snapshots in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            revoke-snapshot-access
          --snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--snapshot-cluster-identifier <value>]
          --account-with-restore-access <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the  snapshot  that  the  account  can  no  longer
          access.

       --snapshot-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the cluster the snapshot was created from. This
          parameter is required if your IAM user has  a  policy  containing  a
          snapshot  resource  element that specifies anything other than * for
          the cluster name.

       --account-with-restore-access (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Web Services account that can no longer
          restore the specified snapshot.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
   Revoke the Authorization of an AWS Account to Restore a Snapshot
       This  example revokes the authorization of the AWS account 444455556666

       JSON format.

                as "creating".

              o DescribeClusterSnapshots returns status as "creating", "avail-
                able", "final snapshot", or "failed".

              enhanced VPC routing, the cluster must be in  a  VPC.  For  more
              information,  see  Enhanced  VPC  Routing in the Amazon Redshift
