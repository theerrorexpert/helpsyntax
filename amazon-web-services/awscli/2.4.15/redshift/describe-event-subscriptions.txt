DESCRIBE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTIONS()                  DESCRIBE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTIONS()



NAME
       describe-event-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  descriptions  of all the Amazon Redshift event notification sub-
       scriptions for a customer account. If you specify a subscription  name,
       lists the description for that subscription.

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all event notification subscriptions  that  match  any
       combination  of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have
       owner and environment for tag keys, and admin and test for tag  values,
       all  subscriptions  that  have  any  combination  of  those  values are
       returned.

       If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, subscriptions
       are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associ-
       ated with them.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-event-subscriptions is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: EventSubscriptionsList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-event-subscriptions
          [--subscription-name <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The  name  of the Amazon Redshift event notification subscription to
          be described.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A tag key or keys for which you want to return  all  matching  event
          notification  subscriptions  that  are associated with the specified
          key or keys. For example, suppose that you have  subscriptions  that
          are  tagged  with keys called owner and environment . If you specify
          both of these tag keys in the request,  Amazon  Redshift  returns  a
          response  with  the  subscriptions that have either or both of these
          tag keys associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you  want  to  return  all  matching
          event notification subscriptions that are associated with the speci-
          fied tag value or values. For example, suppose that  you  have  sub-
          scriptions  that  are  tagged with values called admin and test . If
          you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift
          returns  a  response with the subscriptions that have either or both
          of these tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)

          this returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying  the
          command.  If  the  Marker  field is empty, all response records have
          been retrieved for the request.
