NAME
       modify-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the settings for a snapshot.

       This  exanmple modifies the manual retention period setting for a clus-
       ter snapshot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-cluster-snapshot
          --snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--manual-snapshot-retention-period <value>]
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the snapshot whose setting you want to modify.

       --manual-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days that a manual snapshot is retained. If the  value
          is -1, the manual snapshot is retained indefinitely.

          If  the  manual  snapshot falls outside of the new retention period,
          you can specify the force option to immediately delete the snapshot.

          The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          A  Boolean  option  to override an exception if the retention period
          has already passed.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify cluster snapshot

       The following modify-cluster-snapshot example sets the manual retention
       period  setting for the specified cluster snapshot to value of 10 days.

          aws redshift modify-cluster-snapshot \
              --snapshot-identifier mycluster-2019-11-06-16-32 \
              --manual-snapshot-retention-period 10
