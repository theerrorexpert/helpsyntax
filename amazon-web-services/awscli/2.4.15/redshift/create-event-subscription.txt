CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon Redshift event notification subscription. This action
       requires an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of an Amazon SNS  topic  created
       by  either  the Amazon Redshift console, the Amazon SNS console, or the
       Amazon SNS API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS,  you  must  create  a
       topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in
       the SNS console.

       You can specify the source type, and lists of  Amazon  Redshift  source
       IDs, event categories, and event severities. Notifications will be sent
       for all events you want that match those criteria. For example, you can
       specify source type = cluster, source ID = my-cluster-1 and mycluster2,
       event categories = Availability, Backup, and severity = ERROR. The sub-
       scription  will  only  send notifications for those ERROR events in the
       Availability and Backup categories for the specified clusters.

       If you specify both the source type and source IDs, such as source type
       =  cluster  and source identifier = my-cluster-1, notifications will be
       sent for all the cluster events for  my-cluster-1.  If  you  specify  a
       source  type  but  do not specify a source identifier, you will receive
       notice of the events for the objects of that type in  your  Amazon  Web
       Services  account.  If you do not specify either the SourceType nor the
       SourceIdentifier, you will be notified of  events  generated  from  all
       Amazon  Redshift sources belonging to your Amazon Web Services account.
       You must specify a source type if you specify a source ID.

SYNOPSIS
            create-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          --sns-topic-arn <value>
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--source-ids <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--severity <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the event subscription to be created.

          Constraints:

          o Cannot be null, empty, or blank.

          o Must contain from 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Amazon  SNS  topic  used  to
          transmit  the  event notifications. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS
          when you create a topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of source that will be generating the events. For  example,
          if  you  want  to  be notified of events generated by a cluster, you
          would set this parameter to cluster. If this value is not specified,
          events  are  returned for all Amazon Redshift objects in your Amazon
          Web Services account. You must specify a source  type  in  order  to
          specify source IDs.

          Valid   values:   cluster,   cluster-parameter-group,  cluster-secu-
          rity-group, cluster-snapshot, and scheduled-action.

       --source-ids (list)
          A list of one or more identifiers of Amazon Redshift source objects.
          All  of the objects must be of the same type as was specified in the
          source type parameter.  The  event  subscription  will  return  only
          events  generated  by  the specified objects. If not specified, then
          events are returned for all objects within the  source  type  speci-
          fied.

          Example: my-cluster-1, my-cluster-2

          Example: my-snapshot-20131010

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --event-categories (list)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Redshift event categories to be published by
          the event notification subscription.

          Values: configuration, management, monitoring, security, pending

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --severity (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Redshift event severity to be published by  the
          event notification subscription.

          Values: ERROR, INFO

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A  boolean  value; set to true to activate the subscription, and set
          to false to create the subscription but not activate it.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tag instances.

          (structure)
              A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key, or name, for the resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
