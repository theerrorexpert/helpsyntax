NAME
       batch-delete-cluster-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a set of cluster snapshots.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-cluster-snapshots
          --identifiers <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifiers (list)
          A list of identifiers for the snapshots that you want to delete.

          (structure)
              SnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the manual snapshot to be deleted.

                 Constraints: Must be the name of an existing snapshot that is
                 in the available , failed , or cancelled state.

              SnapshotClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the cluster the snapshot was created
                 from.  This parameter is required if your IAM user has a pol-
                 icy containing a snapshot  resource  element  that  specifies
                 anything other than * for the cluster name.

                 Constraints: Must be the name of valid cluster.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SnapshotIdentifier=string,SnapshotClusterIdentifier=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SnapshotIdentifier": "string",
              "SnapshotClusterIdentifier": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a set of cluster snapshots

       The  following  batch-delete-cluster-snapshots example deletes a set of
       manual cluster snapshots.

          aws redshift batch-delete-cluster-snapshots \
                  --identifiers SnapshotIdentifier=mycluster-2019-11-06-14-12 SnapshotIdentifier=mycluster-2019-11-06-14-20

       Output:

          {
              "Resources": [
                  "mycluster-2019-11-06-14-12",
                  "mycluster-2019-11-06-14-20"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Resources -> (list)
          A list of the snapshot identifiers that were deleted.

          (string)

       Errors -> (list)
          A list of any errors returned.

          (structure)
              Describes the errors returned by a snapshot.

              SnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the snapshot returning the error.

              SnapshotClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the cluster.

              FailureCode -> (string)
                 The failure code for the error.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 The text message describing the error.
