DELETE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                            DELETE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       delete-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified  manual  snapshot.  The snapshot must be in the
       available state, with no other users authorized to access the snapshot.

       Unlike  automated  snapshots,  manual snapshots are retained even after
       you delete your cluster. Amazon Redshift does not  delete  your  manual
       snapshots.  You must delete manual snapshot explicitly to avoid getting
       charged. If other accounts are authorized to access the  snapshot,  you
       must  revoke  all of the authorizations before you can delete the snap-
       shot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-cluster-snapshot
          --snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--snapshot-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the manual snapshot to be deleted.

          Constraints: Must be the name of an existing snapshot that is in the
          available , failed , or cancelled state.

       --snapshot-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  unique identifier of the cluster the snapshot was created from.
          This parameter is required if your IAM user has a policy  containing
          a snapshot resource element that specifies anything other than * for
          the cluster name.

          Constraints: Must be the name of valid cluster.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Snapshot -> (structure)
          Describes a snapshot.

          SnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
              The snapshot identifier that is provided in the request.

          SnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  (in  UTC format) when Amazon Redshift began the snap-

              exact time.

          Status -> (string)
              The  snapshot status. The value of the status depends on the API
              operation used:

              o CreateClusterSnapshot and  CopyClusterSnapshot returns  status
                as "creating".

              o DescribeClusterSnapshots returns status as "creating", "avail-
                able", "final snapshot", or "failed".

              o DeleteClusterSnapshot returns status as "deleted".

          Port -> (integer)
              The port that the cluster is listening on.

          SnapshotType -> (string)
              The snapshot type. Snapshots created  using   CreateClusterSnap-
              shot and  CopyClusterSnapshot are of type "manual".

          NodeType -> (string)
              The node type of the nodes in the cluster.

              that was used to encrypt data in  the  cluster  from  which  the
              snapshot was taken.

          EncryptedWithHSM -> (boolean)
              A  boolean that indicates whether the snapshot data is encrypted

              enhanced VPC routing enabled. To  create  a  cluster  that  uses
              enhanced  VPC  routing,  the  cluster must be in a VPC. For more
              information, see Enhanced VPC Routing  in  the  Amazon  Redshift
              Cluster Management Guide.

          ManualSnapshotRemainingDays -> (integer)
              The number of days until a manual snapshot will pass its  reten-
              tion period.
