GET-CALLER-IDENTITY()                                    GET-CALLER-IDENTITY()



NAME
       get-caller-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  details  about the IAM user or role whose credentials are used
       to call the operation.

       NOTE:
          No permissions are required to perform this operation. If an  admin-
          istrator  adds  a  policy  to  your IAM user or role that explicitly
          denies access to the sts:GetCallerIdentity  action,  you  can  still
          perform  this  operation.  Permissions  are not required because the
          same information is returned when an IAM  user  or  role  is  denied
          access. To view an example response, see I Am Not Authorized to Per-
          form: iam:DeleteVirtualMFADevice in the IAM User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-caller-identity
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details about the current IAM identity

       The following get-caller-identity example  displays  information  about
       the IAM identity used to authenticate the request. The caller is an IAM
       user.

          aws sts get-caller-identity

       Output:

          {
              "UserId": "AIDASAMPLEUSERID",
              "Account": "123456789012",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/DevAdmin"
          }

OUTPUT
       UserId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the calling entity. The exact value depends
          on  the  type of entity that is making the call. The values returned
          are those listed in the aws:userid column  in  the  Principal  table
          found on the Policy Variables reference page in the IAM User Guide .

       Account -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID number of the account  that  owns
          or contains the calling entity.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services ARN associated with the calling entity.
