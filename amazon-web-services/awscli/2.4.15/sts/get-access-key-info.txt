GET-ACCESS-KEY-INFO()                                    GET-ACCESS-KEY-INFO()



NAME
       get-access-key-info -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the account identifier for the specified access key ID.

       Access  keys  consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKI-
       AIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE ) and a secret access key  (for  example,  wJalrXUtn-
       FEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY  ).  For  more information about access
       keys, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the IAM User Guide .

       When you pass an access key ID to this operation, it returns the ID  of
       the  Amazon  Web  Services account to which the keys belong. Access key
       IDs beginning with AKIA are long-term credentials for an  IAM  user  or
       the  Amazon  Web  Services  account root user. Access key IDs beginning
       with ASIA are temporary credentials that are created using  STS  opera-
       tions.  If  the account in the response belongs to you, you can sign in
       as the root user and review your root user access keys. Then,  you  can
       pull  a  credentials  report  to learn which IAM user owns the keys. To
       learn who requested the temporary credentials for an ASIA  access  key,
       view the STS events in your CloudTrail logs in the IAM User Guide .

       This  operation  does not indicate the state of the access key. The key
       might be active, inactive, or deleted. Active keys might not have  per-
       missions  to perform an operation. Providing a deleted access key might
       return an error that the key doesn't exist.

SYNOPSIS
            get-access-key-info
          --access-key-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --access-key-id (string)
          The identifier of an access key.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern) a string of  char-
          acters  that can consist of any upper- or lowercase letter or digit.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Account -> (string)
          The number used to identify the Amazon Web Services account.
