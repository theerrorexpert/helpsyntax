GET-SESSION-TOKEN()                                        GET-SESSION-TOKEN()



NAME
       get-session-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  set  of  temporary  credentials  for an Amazon Web Services
       account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an  access  key  ID,  a
       secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use GetSession-
       Token if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic calls to  specific
       Amazon  Web  Services  API  operations  like Amazon EC2 StopInstances .
       MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call GetSessionToken and submit  an
       MFA  code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary
       security credentials that are returned from the  call,  IAM  users  can
       then make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA authen-
       tication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then the API returns
       an  access  denied  error. For a comparison of GetSessionToken with the
       other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting
       Temporary  Security  Credentials  and Comparing the Amazon Web Services
       STS API operations in the IAM User Guide .
          Session Duration

       The GetSessionToken operation must be called  by  using  the  long-term
       Amazon  Web  Services  security  credentials of the Amazon Web Services
       account root user or an IAM user. Credentials that are created  by  IAM
       users  are  valid  for the duration that you specify. This duration can
       range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600  seconds
       (36  hours),  with  a default of 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Credentials
       based on account credentials can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up
       to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1 hour.
          Permissions

       The  temporary  security  credentials created by GetSessionToken can be
       used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the fol-
       lowing exceptions:

       o You  cannot  call  any  IAM  API operations unless MFA authentication
         information is included in the request.

       o You cannot call any STS API except  AssumeRole or GetCallerIdentity .

       NOTE:
          We  recommend  that  you do not call GetSessionToken with Amazon Web
          Services account root user credentials.  Instead,  follow  our  best
          practices  by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the neces-
          sary permissions, and using IAM users for everyday interaction  with
          Amazon Web Services.

       The  credentials that are returned by GetSessionToken are based on per-
       missions associated with the user whose credentials were used  to  call
       the  operation.  If GetSessionToken is called using Amazon Web Services
       account root user credentials, the temporary credentials have root user
       permissions.  Similarly, if GetSessionToken is called using the creden-
       tials of an IAM user, the temporary credentials have the  same  permis-
       sions as the IAM user.

       For  more  information  about using GetSessionToken to create temporary
       credentials, go to Temporary Credentials for Users in  Untrusted  Envi-
       ronments in the IAM User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-session-token
          [--duration-seconds <value>]
          [--serial-number <value>]
          [--token-code <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The  duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain valid.
          Acceptable durations for IAM user sessions range  from  900  seconds
          (15  minutes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12
          hours) as the default. Sessions for Amazon Web Services account own-
          ers  are restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If the
          duration is longer than one hour, the session for  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices account owners defaults to one hour.

       --serial-number (string)
          The  identification number of the MFA device that is associated with
          the IAM user who is making the GetSessionToken  call.  Specify  this
          value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA authentication.
          The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as
          GAHT12345678 ) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device
          (such as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user  ).  You  can  find  the
          device  for  an IAM user by going to the Amazon Web Services Manage-
          ment Console and viewing the user's security credentials.

          The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of  characters
          consisting  of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
          spaces. You can also include underscores or  any  of  the  following
          characters: =,.@:/-

       --token-code (string)
          The  value  provided  by  the MFA device, if MFA is required. If any
          policy requires the IAM user to submit an  MFA  code,  specify  this
          value.  If  MFA  authentication is required, the user must provide a
          code when requesting a set of temporary security credentials. A user
          who  fails  to provide the code receives an "access denied" response
          when requesting resources that require MFA authentication.

          The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is
          a sequence of six numeric digits.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a set of short term credentials for an IAM identity

       The  following  get-session-token example retrieves a set of short-term
       credentials for the IAM identity making the call. The resulting creden-
       tials  can be used for requests where multi-factor authentication (MFA)
       is required by policy. The credentials expire 15 minutes after they are
       generated.

          aws sts get-session-token \
              --duration-seconds 900 \
              --serial-number "YourMFADeviceSerialNumber" \
              --token-code 123456

       Output:

          {
              "Credentials": {
                  "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                  "SecretAccessKey": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYzEXAMPLEKEY",
                  "SessionToken": "AQoEXAMPLEH4aoAH0gNCAPyJxz4BlCFFxWNE1OPTgk5TthT+FvwqnKwRcOIfrRh3c/LTo6UDdyJwOOvEVPvLXCrrrUtdnniCEXAMPLE/IvU1dYUg2RVAJBanLiHb4IgRmpRV3zrkuWJOgQs8IZZaIv2BXIa2R4OlgkBN9bkUDNCJiBeb/AXlzBBko7b15fjrBs2+cTQtpZ3CYWFXG8C5zqx37wnOE49mRl/+OtkIKGO7fAE",
                  "Expiration": "2020-05-19T18:06:10+00:00"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Credentials -> (structure)
          The temporary security credentials, which include an access key  ID,
          a secret access key, and a security (or session) token.

          NOTE:
              The size of the security token that STS API operations return is
              not fixed. We strongly recommend that you  make  no  assumptions
              about the maximum size.

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              The access key ID that identifies the temporary security creden-
              tials.

          SecretAccessKey -> (string)
              The secret access key that can be used to sign requests.

          SessionToken -> (string)
              The token that users must pass to the service  API  to  use  the
              temporary credentials.

          Expiration -> (timestamp)
              The date on which the current credentials expire.
