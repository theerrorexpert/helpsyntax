GET-FEDERATION-TOKEN()                                  GET-FEDERATION-TOKEN()



NAME
       get-federation-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  set  of  temporary  security  credentials (consisting of an
       access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a  feder-
       ated  user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary
       security credentials on behalf of  distributed  applications  inside  a
       corporate network. You must call the GetFederationToken operation using
       the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As  a  result,  this
       call  is  appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely
       stored, usually in a server-based  application.  For  a  comparison  of
       GetFederationToken with the other API operations that produce temporary
       credentials,  see  Requesting  Temporary   Security   Credentials   and
       Comparing  the  Amazon  Web Services STS API operations in the IAM User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can  authen-
          ticate  users  using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon,
          Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.
          In   this  case,  we  recommend  that  you  use  Amazon  Cognito  or
          AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity . For  more  information,  see  Federation
          Through a Web-based Identity Provider in the IAM User Guide .

       You  can also call GetFederationToken using the security credentials of
       an Amazon Web Services account root user, but we do not  recommend  it.
       Instead,  we  recommend  that you create an IAM user for the purpose of
       the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits
       federated  users  to  only  the actions and resources that they need to
       access. For more information, see IAM Best Practices in  the  IAM  User
       Guide .
          Session duration

       The  temporary  credentials  are valid for the specified duration, from
       900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours).
       The  default  session  duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary
       credentials obtained by using the Amazon Web Services account root user
       credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
          Permissions

       You  can use the temporary credentials created by GetFederationToken in
       any Amazon Web Services service except the following:

       o You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or  the  Amazon  Web
         Services API.

       o You cannot call any STS operations except GetCallerIdentity .

       You  must  pass  an inline or managed session policy to this operation.
       You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline  session
       policy.  You  can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as man-
       aged session policies. The plaintext that you use for both  inline  and
       managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.

       Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a
       policy, then the resulting federated user session has  no  permissions.
       When  you pass session policies, the session permissions are the inter-
       section of the IAM user policies and  the  session  policies  that  you
       pass.  This  gives  you a way to further restrict the permissions for a
       federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant  more  permis-
       sions  than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM
       user. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User  Guide
       .  For  information  about using GetFederationToken to create temporary
       security credentials, see GetFederationTokenFederation Through a Custom
       Identity Broker .

       You   can  use  the  credentials  to  access  a  resource  that  has  a
       resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the  fed-
       erated user session in the Principal element of the policy, the session
       has the permissions  allowed  by  the  policy.  These  permissions  are
       granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.
          Tags

       (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These  are
       called  session  tags.  For  more  information  about session tags, see
       Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can  authen-
          ticate  users  using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon,
          Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.
          In   this  case,  we  recommend  that  you  use  Amazon  Cognito  or
          AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity . For  more  information,  see  Federation
          Through a Web-based Identity Provider in the IAM User Guide .

       An  administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass ses-
       sion tags. The administrator can also create  granular  permissions  to
       allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
       Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User
       Guide .

       Tag  keyvalue pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
       means that you cannot have separate Department and department tag keys.
       Assume that the user that you are federating has the Department =``Mar-
       keting`` tag and you pass the department =``engineering`` session  tag.
       Department  and department are not saved as separate tags, and the ses-
       sion tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.

SYNOPSIS
            get-federation-token
          --name <value>
          [--policy <value>]
          [--policy-arns <value>]
          [--duration-seconds <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the federated user. The name is used  as  an  identifier
          for  the temporary security credentials (such as Bob ). For example,
          you can reference the federated user name in a  resource-based  pol-
          icy, such as in an Amazon S3 bucket policy.

          The  regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
          consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with  no
          spaces.  You  can  also  include underscores or any of the following
          characters: =,.@-

       --policy (string)
          An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline  ses-
          sion policy.

          You must pass an inline or managed session policy to this operation.
          You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline  ses-
          sion  policy.  You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use
          as managed session policies.

          This parameter is optional. However, if you do not pass any  session
          policies,  then  the resulting federated user session has no permis-
          sions.

          When you pass session policies,  the  session  permissions  are  the
          intersection  of the IAM user policies and the session policies that
          you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict  the  permissions
          for  a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more
          permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of
          the  IAM user. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM
          User Guide .

          The resulting credentials can be used to access a resource that  has
          a  resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the
          federated user session in the Principal element of the  policy,  the
          session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions
          are granted in addition to the permissions that are granted  by  the
          session policies.

          The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session poli-
          cies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy  characters  can
          be  any  ASCII  character from the space character to the end of the
          valid character list (u0020 through u00FF). It can also include  the
          tab  (u0009),  linefeed (u000A), and carriage return (u000D) charac-
          ters.

          NOTE:
              An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed  session
              policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a
              separate limit. Your request can fail for  this  limit  even  if
              your  plaintext  meets the other requirements. The PackedPolicy-
              Size response element indicates  by  percentage  how  close  the
              policies  and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.

       --policy-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM  managed  policies  that
          you want to use as a managed session policy. The policies must exist
          in the same account as the IAM user  that  is  requesting  federated
          access.

          You must pass an inline or managed session policy to this operation.
          You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline  ses-
          sion  policy.  You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use
          as managed session policies. The plaintext that  you  use  for  both
          inline  and  managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.
          You can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs. For  more  information
          about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services
          Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

          This parameter is optional. However, if you do not pass any  session
          policies,  then  the resulting federated user session has no permis-
          sions.

          When you pass session policies,  the  session  permissions  are  the
          intersection  of the IAM user policies and the session policies that
          you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict  the  permissions
          for  a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more
          permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of
          the  IAM user. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM
          User Guide .

          The resulting credentials can be used to access a resource that  has
          a  resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the
          federated user session in the Principal element of the  policy,  the
          session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions
          are granted in addition to the permissions that are granted  by  the
          session policies.

          NOTE:
              An  Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session
              policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a
              separate  limit.  Your  request  can fail for this limit even if
              your plaintext meets the other requirements.  The  PackedPolicy-
              Size  response  element  indicates  by  percentage how close the
              policies and tags for your request are to the upper size  limit.

          (structure)
              A  reference  to the IAM managed policy that is passed as a ses-
              sion policy for a role session or a federated user session.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM managed  policy  to
                 use  as  a  session policy for the role. For more information
                 about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and  Amazon  Web
                 Services  Service  Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services Gen-
                 eral Reference .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          arn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "arn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The duration, in seconds, that the session should  last.  Acceptable
          durations  for  federation  sessions range from 900 seconds (15 min-
          utes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12  hours)
          as  the default. Sessions obtained using Amazon Web Services account
          root user credentials are restricted to a maximum of  3,600  seconds
          (one  hour).  If the specified duration is longer than one hour, the
          session obtained by using root  user  credentials  defaults  to  one
          hour.

       --tags (list)
          A  list of session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and
          an associated value. For more information about  session  tags,  see
          Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide .

          This  parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The
          plaintext session tag keys cant exceed 128 characters and the values
          cant exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see IAM
          and STS Character Limits in the IAM User Guide .

          NOTE:
              An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed  session
              policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a
              separate limit. Your request can fail for  this  limit  even  if
              your  plaintext  meets the other requirements. The PackedPolicy-
              Size response element indicates  by  percentage  how  close  the
              policies  and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.

          You can pass a session tag with the  same  key  as  a  tag  that  is
          already  attached  to the user you are federating. When you do, ses-
          sion tags override a user tag with the same key.

          Tag keyvalue pairs are not case sensitive, but  case  is  preserved.
          This  means  that you cannot have separate Department and department
          tag keys. Assume that the role has the Department =``Marketing`` tag
          and you pass the department =``engineering`` session tag. Department
          and department are not saved as separate tags, and the  session  tag
          passed in the request takes precedence over the role tag.

          (structure)
              You  can pass custom key-value pair attributes when you assume a
              role or federate a user. These are called session tags. You  can
              then  use  the  session tags to control access to resources. For
              more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services  STS  Sessions
              in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for a session tag.

                 You  can  pass  up to 50 session tags. The plain text session
                 tag keys cant exceed 128 characters. For these and additional
                 limits,  see  IAM  and  STS  Character Limits in the IAM User
                 Guide .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for a session tag.

                 You can pass up to 50 session tags. The  plain  text  session
                 tag  values  cant  exceed 256 characters. For these and addi-
                 tional limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits  in  the  IAM
                 User Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Credentials -> (structure)
          The  temporary security credentials, which include an access key ID,
          a secret access key, and a security (or session) token.

          NOTE:
              The size of the security token that STS API operations return is
              not  fixed.  We  strongly recommend that you make no assumptions
              about the maximum size.

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              The access key ID that identifies the temporary security creden-
              tials.

          SecretAccessKey -> (string)
              The secret access key that can be used to sign requests.

          SessionToken -> (string)
              The  token  that  users  must pass to the service API to use the
              temporary credentials.

          Expiration -> (timestamp)
              The date on which the current credentials expire.

       FederatedUser -> (structure)
          Identifiers for the federated user associated with  the  credentials
          (such     as     arn:aws:sts::123456789012:federated-user/Bob     or
          123456789012:Bob ). You can use the federated  user's  ARN  in  your
          resource-based policies, such as an Amazon S3 bucket policy.

          FederatedUserId -> (string)
              The  string  that  identifies the federated user associated with
              the credentials, similar to the unique ID of an IAM user.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN that specifies the federated  user  that  is  associated
              with the credentials. For more information about ARNs and how to
              use them in policies, see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User  Guide
              .

       PackedPolicySize -> (integer)
          A  percentage  value  that  indicates the packed size of the session
          policies and session  tags  combined  passed  in  the  request.  The
          request  fails if the packed size is greater than 100 percent, which
          means the policies and tags exceeded the allowed space.
