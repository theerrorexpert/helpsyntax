DECODE-AUTHORIZATION-MESSAGE()                  DECODE-AUTHORIZATION-MESSAGE()



NAME
       decode-authorization-message -

DESCRIPTION
       Decodes  additional  information  about  the  authorization status of a
       request from an encoded message returned in response to an  Amazon  Web
       Services request.

       For  example,  if a user is not authorized to perform an operation that
       he or she has requested, the request returns a Client.UnauthorizedOper-
       ation  response (an HTTP 403 response). Some Amazon Web Services opera-
       tions additionally return an encoded message that can  provide  details
       about this authorization failure.

       NOTE:
          Only certain Amazon Web Services operations return an encoded autho-
          rization message. The  documentation  for  an  individual  operation
          indicates whether that operation returns an encoded message in addi-
          tion to returning an HTTP code.

       The message is encoded because the details of the authorization  status
       can  contain  privileged  information  that  the user who requested the
       operation should not see. To decode an authorization status message,  a
       user  must  be granted permissions through an IAM policy to request the
       DecodeAuthorizationMessage (sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage ) action.

       The decoded message includes the following type of information:

       o Whether the request was denied due to an explicit deny or due to  the
         absence  of  an explicit allow. For more information, see Determining
         Whether a Request is Allowed or Denied in the IAM User Guide .

       o The principal who made the request.

       o The requested action.

       o The requested resource.

       o The values of condition keys in the context of the user's request.

SYNOPSIS
            decode-authorization-message
          --encoded-message <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --encoded-message (string)
          The encoded message that was returned with the response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DecodedMessage -> (string)
          The API returns a response with the decoded message.
