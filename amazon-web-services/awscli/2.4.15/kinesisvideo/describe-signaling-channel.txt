DESCRIBE-SIGNALING-CHANNEL()                      DESCRIBE-SIGNALING-CHANNEL()



NAME
       describe-signaling-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  most current information about the signaling channel. You
       must specify either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the
       channel that you want to describe.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-signaling-channel
          [--channel-name <value>]
          [--channel-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The name of the signaling channel that you want to describe.

       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the signaling channel that you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChannelInfo -> (structure)
          A  structure  that  encapsulates  the  specified signaling channel's
          metadata and properties.

          ChannelName -> (string)
              The name of the signaling channel.

          ChannelARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the signaling channel.

          ChannelType -> (string)
              The type of the signaling channel.

          ChannelStatus -> (string)
              Current status of the signaling channel.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the signaling channel was created.

          SingleMasterConfiguration -> (structure)
              A structure that contains the configuration for the  SINGLE_MAS-
              TER channel type.

              MessageTtlSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  period  of time a signaling channel retains underlivered
                 messages before they are discarded.

          Version -> (string)
              The current version of the signaling channel.
