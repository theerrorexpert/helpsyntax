DELETE-STREAM()                                                DELETE-STREAM()



NAME
       delete-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a Kinesis video stream and the data contained in the stream.

       This  method  marks  the stream for deletion, and makes the data in the
       stream inaccessible immediately.

       To ensure that you have the latest version of the stream before  delet-
       ing  it,  you  can  specify  the  stream version. Kinesis Video Streams
       assigns a version to each stream. When you  update  a  stream,  Kinesis
       Video  Streams  assigns  a new version number. To get the latest stream
       version, use the DescribeStream API.

       This operation requires permission  for  the  KinesisVideo:DeleteStream
       action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-stream
          --stream-arn <value>
          [--current-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  stream that you want to
          delete.

       --current-version (string)
          Optional: The version of the stream that you want to delete.

          Specify the version as a safeguard to ensure that your are  deleting
          the  correct  stream.  To  get the stream version, use the Describe-
          Stream API.

          If not specified, only the CreationTime is checked  before  deleting
          the stream.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
