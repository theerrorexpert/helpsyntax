LIST-SIGNALING-CHANNELS()                            LIST-SIGNALING-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-signaling-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array of ChannelInfo objects. Each object describes a sig-
       naling channel. To retrieve only those channels that satisfy a specific
       condition, you can specify a ChannelNameCondition .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-signaling-channels  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ChannelInfoList

SYNOPSIS
            list-signaling-channels
          [--channel-name-condition <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-name-condition (structure)
          Optional: Returns only the channels that satisfy a  specific  condi-
          tion.

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              A  comparison  operator.  Currently,  you  can  only specify the
              BEGINS_WITH operator, which finds signaling channels whose names
              begin with a given prefix.

          ComparisonValue -> (string)
              A value to compare.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ComparisonOperator=string,ComparisonValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ComparisonOperator": "BEGINS_WITH",
            "ComparisonValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChannelInfoList -> (list)
          An array of ChannelInfo objects.

          (structure)
              A structure that encapsulates a signaling channel's metadata and
              properties.

              ChannelName -> (string)
                 The name of the signaling channel.

              ChannelARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the signaling channel.

              ChannelType -> (string)
                 The type of the signaling channel.

              ChannelStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the signaling channel.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the signaling channel was created.

              SingleMasterConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that  contains  the  configuration for the SIN-
                 GLE_MASTER channel type.

                 MessageTtlSeconds -> (integer)
                     The period of time a signaling channel retains  underliv-
                     ered messages before they are discarded.

              Version -> (string)
                 The current version of the signaling channel.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, the call returns this element with a
          token. To get the next batch of streams, use this token in your next
          request.
