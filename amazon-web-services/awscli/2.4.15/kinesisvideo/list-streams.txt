LIST-STREAMS()                                                  LIST-STREAMS()



NAME
       list-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of StreamInfo objects. Each object describes a stream.
       To retrieve only streams that satisfy a  specific  condition,  you  can
       specify a StreamNameCondition .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-streams is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: StreamInfoList

SYNOPSIS
            list-streams
          [--stream-name-condition <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name-condition (structure)
          Optional: Returns only streams that satisfy  a  specific  condition.
          Currently,  you  can  specify  only the prefix of a stream name as a
          condition.

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              A comparison operator.  Currently,  you  can  specify  only  the
              BEGINS_WITH operator, which finds streams whose names start with
              a given prefix.

          ComparisonValue -> (string)
              A value to compare.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ComparisonOperator=string,ComparisonValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ComparisonOperator": "BEGINS_WITH",
            "ComparisonValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StreamInfoList -> (list)
          An array of StreamInfo objects.

          (structure)
              An object describing a Kinesis video stream.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The name of the device that is associated with the stream.

              StreamName -> (string)
                 The name of the stream.

              StreamARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream.

              MediaType -> (string)
                 The MediaType of the stream.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that
                 Kinesis Video Streams uses to encrypt data on the stream.

              Version -> (string)
                 The version of the stream.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the stream.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp that indicates when the stream was created.

              DataRetentionInHours -> (integer)
                 How long the stream retains data, in hours.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, the call returns this element  with  a
          token. To get the next batch of streams, use this token in your next
          request.
