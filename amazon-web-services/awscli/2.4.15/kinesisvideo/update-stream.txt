UPDATE-STREAM()                                                UPDATE-STREAM()



NAME
       update-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates stream metadata, such as the device name and media type.

       You  must  provide the stream name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
       the stream.

       To make sure that you have the latest  version  of  the  stream  before
       updating  it, you can specify the stream version. Kinesis Video Streams
       assigns a version to each stream. When you  update  a  stream,  Kinesis
       Video  Streams  assigns  a new version number. To get the latest stream
       version, use the DescribeStream API.
          UpdateStream is an asynchronous operation, and takes  time  to  com-
          plete.

SYNOPSIS
            update-stream
          [--stream-name <value>]
          [--stream-arn <value>]
          --current-version <value>
          [--device-name <value>]
          [--media-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream whose metadata you want to update.

          The  stream name is an identifier for the stream, and must be unique
          for each account and region.

       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the stream whose metadata you want to update.

       --current-version (string)
          The version of the stream whose metadata you want to update.

       --device-name (string)
          The name of the device that is writing to the stream.

          NOTE:
              In the current implementation, Kinesis Video  Streams  does  not
              use this name.

       --media-type (string)
          The  stream's  media type. Use MediaType to specify the type of con-
          tent that the stream contains to the consumers of  the  stream.  For
          more  information about media types, see Media Types . If you choose
          to specify the MediaType , see Naming Requirements .

          To play video on the console, you must  specify  the  correct  video
          type.  For  example,  if  the  video in the stream is H.264, specify
          video/h264 as the MediaType .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
