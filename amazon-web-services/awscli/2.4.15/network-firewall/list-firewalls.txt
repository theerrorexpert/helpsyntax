LIST-FIREWALLS()                                              LIST-FIREWALLS()



NAME
       list-firewalls -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the metadata for the firewalls that you have defined. If you
       provide VPC identifiers in your request, this returns  only  the  fire-
       walls for those VPCs.

       Depending  on your setting for max results and the number of firewalls,
       a single call might not return the full list.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewalls is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Firewalls

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewalls
          [--vpc-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vpc-ids (list)
          The unique identifiers of the VPCs that you want Network Firewall to
          retrieve the firewalls for. Leave this blank to retrieve  all  fire-
          walls that you have defined.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a MaxResults setting, if the
          number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a NextToken value in
          the  response.  To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token
          returned from the prior request in your next request.

       Firewalls -> (list)
          The firewall metadata objects  for  the  VPCs  that  you  specified.
          Depending  on  your  setting for max results and the number of fire-
          walls you have, a single call might not be the full list.

          (structure)
              High-level information about a firewall, returned by  operations
              like  create  and describe. You can use the information provided
              in the metadata to retrieve and manage a firewall.

              FirewallName -> (string)
                 The descriptive name of the firewall. You  can't  change  the
                 name of a firewall after you create it.

              FirewallArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.
