PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()                                    PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  an  AWS Identity and Access Management policy for
       your rule group or firewall policy. Use this to share rule  groups  and
       firewall policies between accounts. This operation works in conjunction
       with the AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) service to  manage  resource
       sharing for Network Firewall.

       Use  this operation to create or update a resource policy for your rule
       group or firewall policy. In the policy, you specify the accounts  that
       you  want  to  share the resource with and the operations that you want
       the accounts to be able to perform.

       When you add an account in the resource policy, you then run  the  fol-
       lowing  Resource  Access  Manager (RAM) operations to access and accept
       the shared rule group or firewall policy.

       o GetResourceShareInvitations  -  Returns  the  Amazon  Resource  Names
         (ARNs) of the resource share invitations.

       o AcceptResourceShareInvitation  -  Accepts  the share invitation for a
         specified resource share.

       For additional information about resource sharing using  RAM,  see  AWS
       Resource Access Manager User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            put-resource-policy
          --resource-arn <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the account that you want to share
          rule groups and firewall policies with.

       --policy (string)
          The AWS Identity and Access Management policy statement  that  lists
          the accounts that you want to share your rule group or firewall pol-
          icy with and the operations that you want the accounts to be able to
          perform.

          For  a rule group resource, you can specify the following operations
          in the Actions section of the statement:

          o network-firewall:CreateFirewallPolicy

          o network-firewall:UpdateFirewallPolicy

          o network-firewall:ListRuleGroups

          For a firewall policy resource, you can specify the following opera-
          tions in the Actions section of the statement:

          o network-firewall:CreateFirewall

          o network-firewall:UpdateFirewall

          o network-firewall:AssociateFirewallPolicy

          o network-firewall:ListFirewallPolicies

          In  the  Resource section of the statement, you specify the ARNs for
          the rule groups and firewall policies that you want  to  share  with
          the account that you specified in Arn .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
