CREATE-FIREWALL()                                            CREATE-FIREWALL()



NAME
       create-firewall -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  AWS Network Firewall  Firewall and accompanying  Firewall-
       Status for a VPC.

       The firewall defines the configuration  settings  for  an  AWS  Network
       Firewall firewall. The settings that you can define at creation include
       the firewall policy, the subnets in your VPC to use  for  the  firewall
       endpoints, and any tags that are attached to the firewall AWS resource.

       After you create a firewall, you can provide additional settings,  like
       the logging configuration.

       To  update  the  settings  for  a firewall, you use the operations that
       apply to the settings themselves, for example   UpdateLoggingConfigura-
       tion ,  AssociateSubnets , and  UpdateFirewallDeleteProtection .

       To  manage  a  firewall's  tags,  use the standard AWS resource tagging
       operations,  ListTagsForResource ,  TagResource , and  UntagResource  .

       To   retrieve  information  about  firewalls,  use   ListFirewalls  and
       DescribeFirewall .

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

       --firewall-policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  FirewallPolicy that you want
          to use for the firewall.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the VPC where Network Firewall should  cre-
          ate the firewall.

          You can't change this setting after you create the firewall.

       --subnet-mappings (list)
          The  public subnets to use for your Network Firewall firewalls. Each
          subnet must belong to a different Availability Zone in the VPC. Net-
          work Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet.

          (structure)
              The  ID  for  a subnet that you want to associate with the fire-
              wall. This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets  .
              AWS Network Firewall creates an instance of the associated fire-
              wall in each subnet that you specify, to filter traffic  in  the
              subnet's Availability Zone.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the subnet.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SubnetId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --delete-protection | --no-delete-protection (boolean)
          A  flag  indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A
          setting of TRUE indicates that the  firewall  is  protected  against
          deletion.  Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting
          a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation
          initializes this flag to TRUE .

       --subnet-change-protection | --no-subnet-change-protection (boolean)
          A  setting  indicating  whether  the  firewall  is protected against
          changes to the subnet associations.  Use  this  setting  to  protect
          against  accidentally  modifying the subnet associations for a fire-
          wall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation  ini-
          tializes this setting to TRUE .

       --firewall-policy-change-protection  | --no-firewall-policy-change-pro-
       tection (boolean)
          A setting indicating whether the firewall  is  protected  against  a
          change  to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to pro-
          tect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a  fire-
          wall  that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation ini-
          tializes this setting to TRUE .

       --description (string)
          A description of the firewall.

       --tags (list)
          The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

          (structure)
              A key:value pair associated with an AWS resource. The  key:value
              pair  can  be anything you define. Typically, the tag key repre-
              sents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value  rep-
              resents  a  specific value within that category (such as "test,"
              "development," or "production"). You can add up to  50  tags  to
              each AWS resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can
                 use a tag key to describe a category of information, such  as
                 "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can
                 use a tag value to describe a specific value within  a  cate-
                 gory,  such  as  "companyA"  or  "companyB."  Tag  values are
                 case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Firewall -> (structure)
          The configuration settings for the firewall. These settings  include
          the firewall policy and the subnets in your VPC to use for the fire-
          wall endpoints.

          FirewallName -> (string)
              The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the  name
              of a firewall after you create it.

          FirewallArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          FirewallPolicyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

              The  relationship of firewall to firewall policy is many to one.
              Each firewall requires one firewall policy association, and  you
              can use the same firewall policy for multiple firewalls.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the VPC where the firewall is in use.

          SubnetMappings -> (list)
              The  public subnets that Network Firewall is using for the fire-
              wall. Each subnet must belong to a different Availability  Zone.

              (structure)
                 The ID for a subnet that you want to associate with the fire-
                 wall. This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets
                 .  AWS Network Firewall creates an instance of the associated
                 firewall in each subnet that you specify, to  filter  traffic
                 in the subnet's Availability Zone.

                 SubnetId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the subnet.

          DeleteProtection -> (boolean)
              A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall.
              A setting of TRUE  indicates  that  the  firewall  is  protected
              against  deletion.  Use this setting to protect against acciden-
              tally deleting a firewall that is in  use.  When  you  create  a
              firewall, the operation initializes this flag to TRUE .

          SubnetChangeProtection -> (boolean)
              A  setting  indicating whether the firewall is protected against
              changes to the subnet associations. Use this setting to  protect
              against  accidentally  modifying  the  subnet associations for a
              firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the  opera-
              tion initializes this setting to TRUE .

          FirewallPolicyChangeProtection -> (boolean)
              A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against a
              change to the firewall policy association. Use this  setting  to
              protect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a
              firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the  opera-
              tion initializes this setting to TRUE .

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the firewall.

          FirewallId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the firewall.

          Tags -> (list)
              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair  associated  with  an  AWS  resource.  The
                 key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag
                 key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag
                 value represents a specific value within that category  (such
                 as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to
                 50 tags to each AWS resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can  use a tag key to describe a category of information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category, such as "companyA" or  "companyB."  Tag  values
                     are case-sensitive.

       FirewallStatus -> (structure)
          Detailed  information  about the current status of a  Firewall . You
          can retrieve this for a firewall by  calling   DescribeFirewall  and
          providing the firewall name and ARN.

          Status -> (string)
              The readiness of the configured firewall to handle network traf-
              fic across all of the Availability Zones where you've configured
              it.  This setting is READY only when the ConfigurationSyncState-
              Summary value is IN_SYNC and the Attachment  Status  values  for
              all of the configured subnets are READY .

          ConfigurationSyncStateSummary -> (string)
              The  configuration  sync state for the firewall. This summarizes
              the sync states reported in the Config settings for all  of  the
              Availability Zones where you have configured the firewall.

              When  you  create  a  firewall  or update its configuration, for
              example by adding a rule group to its firewall  policy,  Network
              Firewall  distributes  the  configuration  changes  to all zones
              where the firewall is in use. This summary indicates whether the
              configuration changes have been applied everywhere.

              This  status  must  be  IN_SYNC for the firewall to be ready for
              use, but it doesn't indicate that the  firewall  is  ready.  The
              Status setting indicates firewall readiness.

          SyncStates -> (map)
              The  subnets that you've configured for use by the Network Fire-
              wall firewall. This contains one array element per  Availability
              Zone  where  you've  configured  a subnet. These objects provide
              details of the information that is summarized in the  Configura-
              tionSyncStateSummary  and  Status , broken down by zone and con-
              figuration object.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy  con-
                 figuration for a single VPC subnet.

                 For  each  VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, AWS
                 Network Firewall does the following:

                 o Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the  subnet,  ready  to
                   take traffic.

                 o Configures  the  endpoint  with the current firewall policy
                   settings, to provide the filtering behavior  for  the  end-
                   point.

                 When you update a firewall, for example to add a subnet asso-
                 ciation or change a rule group in the  firewall  policy,  the
                 affected  sync states reflect out-of-sync or not ready status
                 until the changes are complete.

                 Attachment -> (structure)
                     The attachment status of the firewall's association  with
                     a  single VPC subnet. For each configured subnet, Network
                     Firewall creates  the  attachment  by  instantiating  the
                     firewall  endpoint  in  the  subnet so that it's ready to
                     take traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                     SubnetId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier of the subnet that you've speci-
                        fied to be used for a firewall endpoint.

                     EndpointId -> (string)
                        The  identifier  of the firewall endpoint that Network
                        Firewall has instantiated in the subnet. You use  this
                        to  identify  the  firewall  endpoint in the VPC route
                        tables, when you redirect the VPC traffic through  the
                        endpoint.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The  current  status  of  the firewall endpoint in the
                        subnet. This value reflects both the instantiation  of
                        the  endpoint  in  the  VPC subnet and the sync states
                        that are reported in the Config  settings.  When  this
                        value is READY , the endpoint is available and config-
                        ured properly to handle network traffic. When the end-
                        point  isn't  available  for  traffic, this value will
                        reflect its state, for example CREATING ,  DELETING  ,
                        or FAILED .

                 Config -> (map)
                     The  configuration  status  of the firewall endpoint in a
                     single VPC subnet. Network Firewall  provides  each  end-
                     point  with the rules that are configured in the firewall
                     policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the  associ-
                     ated  firewall  policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the
                     rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter  network
                     traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Provides  configuration  status for a single policy or
                        rule group that is used for a firewall endpoint.  Net-
                        work  Firewall  provides  each endpoint with the rules
                        that are configured in the firewall policy. Each  time
                        you  add  a  subnet  or modify the associated firewall
                        policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the
                        endpoint,  so  it can properly filter network traffic.
                        This is part of a  SyncState for a firewall.

                        SyncStatus -> (string)
                            Indicates whether this object is in sync with  the
                            version indicated in the update token.

                        UpdateToken -> (string)
                            The  current  version of the object that is either
                            in sync or pending synchronization.
