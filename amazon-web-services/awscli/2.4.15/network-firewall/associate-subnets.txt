ASSOCIATE-SUBNETS()                                        ASSOCIATE-SUBNETS()



NAME
       associate-subnets -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates the specified subnets in the Amazon VPC to the firewall. You
       can specify one subnet for each of the Availability Zones that the  VPC
       spans.

       This  request creates an AWS Network Firewall firewall endpoint in each
       of the subnets. To enable the firewall's  protections,  you  must  also
       modify  the  VPC's route tables for each subnet's Availability Zone, to
       redirect the traffic that's coming into  and  going  out  of  the  zone
       through the firewall endpoint.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-subnets
          [--update-token <value>]
          [--firewall-arn <value>]
          [--firewall-name <value>]
          --subnet-mappings <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --update-token (string)
          An  optional  token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network
          Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the  firewall.
          The  token  marks  the state of the firewall resource at the time of
          the request.

          To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the  token  in
          your  update  request.  Without the token, Network Firewall performs
          your updates regardless of whether the firewall  has  changed  since
          you last retrieved it.

          To  make  a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in
          your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure  that
          the  firewall  hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has
          changed, the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this
          happens,  retrieve  the  firewall  again to get a current copy of it
          with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the oper-
          ation again using the new token.

       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --subnet-mappings (list)
          The IDs of the subnets that you want to associate with the firewall.

          (structure)
              The  ID  for  a subnet that you want to associate with the fire-
              wall. This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets  .
              AWS Network Firewall creates an instance of the associated fire-
              wall in each subnet that you specify, to filter traffic  in  the
              subnet's Availability Zone.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the subnet.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SubnetId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FirewallArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

       FirewallName -> (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

       SubnetMappings -> (list)
          The IDs of the subnets that are associated with the firewall.

          (structure)
              The ID for a subnet that you want to associate  with  the  fire-
              wall.  This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets .

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the subnet.

       UpdateToken -> (string)
          An optional token that you can use for optimistic  locking.  Network
          Firewall  returns a token to your requests that access the firewall.
