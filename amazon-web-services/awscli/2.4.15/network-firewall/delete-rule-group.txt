NAME
       delete-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified  RuleGroup .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-rule-group
          [--rule-group-name <value>]
          [--rule-group-arn <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-group-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of
          a rule group after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --rule-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --type (string)
          Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or  stateful.  If  the
          rule  group  is  stateless,  it  contains  stateless rules. If it is
          stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          NOTE:
              This setting is required for requests that do  not  include  the
              RuleGroupARN .

          Possible values:

          o STATELESS

          o STATEFUL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RuleGroupResponse -> (structure)
          The  high-level  properties  of  a  rule group. This, along with the
          RuleGroup , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects  for
          a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup .

          RuleGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

              NOTE:
                 If  this response is for a create request that had DryRun set
                 to TRUE , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't  attached
                 to a valid resource.

          RuleGroupName -> (string)
              The  descriptive  name  of  the rule group. You can't change the
              name of a rule group after you create it.

          RuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the rule group.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the rule group.

          Type -> (string)
              Indicates whether the rule group is stateless  or  stateful.  If
              the  rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it
              is stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          Capacity -> (integer)
              The maximum operating resources that this rule  group  can  use.
              Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule
              group, you are limited to this capacity. When  you  reference  a
              rule  group  from  a  firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves
              this capacity for the rule group.

              You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a  rule
              group  before  you create the rule group by calling  CreateRule-
              Group with DryRun set to TRUE .

          RuleGroupStatus -> (string)
              Detailed information about the current status of a rule group.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair  associated  with  an  AWS  resource.  The
                 key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag
                 key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag
                 value  represents a specific value within that category (such
                 as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to
                 50 tags to each AWS resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag key to describe a category of  information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category,  such  as  "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values
                     are case-sensitive.

          ConsumedCapacity -> (integer)
              The number of capacity units  currently  consumed  by  the  rule
              group rules.

          NumberOfAssociations -> (integer)
              The number of firewall policies that use this rule group.
