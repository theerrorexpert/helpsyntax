            update-firewall-policy
          --update-token <value>
          [--firewall-policy-arn <value>]
          [--firewall-policy-name <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --update-token (string)
          A  token  used  for  optimistic  locking. Network Firewall returns a
          token to your requests that access the firewall  policy.  The  token
          marks the state of the policy resource at the time of the request.

          To  make  changes  to  the  policy,  you  provide  the token in your
          request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that  the  policy
          hasn't  changed  since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the
          operation fails with an InvalidTokenException  .  If  this  happens,
          retrieve  the firewall policy again to get a current copy of it with
          current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try  the  opera-
          tion again using the new token.

       --firewall-policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-policy-name (string)
          The  descriptive  name  of the firewall policy. You can't change the
          name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-policy (structure)
          The updated firewall policy to use for the firewall.

          StatelessRuleGroupReferences -> (list)
              References to the stateless rule groups that  are  used  in  the
              policy. These define the matching criteria in stateless rules.

              (structure)
                 Identifier for a single stateless rule group, used in a fire-
                 wall policy to refer to the rule group.

                 ResourceArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  stateless  rule
                     group.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     An  integer  setting that indicates the order in which to
                     run the stateless rule groups in a single  FirewallPolicy
                     . Network Firewall applies each stateless rule group to a
                     packet starting with the group that has the lowest prior-
                     ity  setting.  You must ensure that the priority settings
                     are unique within each policy.

          StatelessDefaultActions -> (list)
              The actions to take on a packet if it doesn't match any  of  the
              stateless  rules in the policy. If you want non-matching packets
              to  be  forwarded  for  stateful  inspection,  specify  aws:for-
              ward_to_sfe .

              You  must  specify  one  of  the  standard  actions:  aws:pass ,
              aws:drop , or aws:forward_to_sfe . In addition, you can  specify
              custom  actions  that  are compatible with your standard section
              choice.

              For example, you could specify ["aws:pass"] or you could specify
              ["aws:pass",  customActionName] . For information about compati-
              bility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

              (string)

          StatelessFragmentDefaultActions -> (list)
              The  actions  to  take  on a fragmented UDP packet if it doesn't
              match any of the stateless rules in the policy. Network Firewall
              only  manages  UDP  packet  fragments  and silently drops packet
              fragments for other protocols. If you  want  non-matching  frag-
              mented  UDP  packets  to  be  forwarded for stateful inspection,
              specify aws:forward_to_sfe .

              You must  specify  one  of  the  standard  actions:  aws:pass  ,
              aws:drop  , or aws:forward_to_sfe . In addition, you can specify
              custom actions that are compatible with  your  standard  section
              choice.

              For example, you could specify ["aws:pass"] or you could specify
              ["aws:pass", customActionName] . For information about  compati-
              bility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

              (string)

          StatelessCustomActions -> (list)
              The custom action definitions that are available for use in  the
              firewall policy's StatelessDefaultActions setting. You name each
              custom action that you define, and then you can use it  by  name
              in your default actions specifications.

              (structure)
                 An  optional, non-standard action to use for stateless packet
                 handling. You can define this in  addition  to  the  standard
                 action that you must specify.

                 You  define  and  name the custom actions that you want to be
                 able to use, and then you reference  them  by  name  in  your
                 actions settings.

                 You can use custom actions in the following places:

                 o In  a rule group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specifi-
                   cation. The custom actions are available for  use  by  name
                   inside  the StatelessRulesAndCustomActions where you define
                   them. You can use them for your stateless rule  actions  to
                   specify  what  to  do with a packet that matches the rule's
                   match attributes.

                 o In a  FirewallPolicy specification,  in  StatelessCustomAc-
                   tions . The custom actions are available for use inside the
                   policy where you define them. You can use them for the pol-
                   icy's default stateless actions settings to specify what to
                   do with packets that don't match any of the policy's state-
                   less rules.

                 ActionName -> (string)
                     The  descriptive  name  of  the  custom action. You can't
                     change the name of a custom action after you create it.

                 ActionDefinition -> (structure)
                     The custom action associated with the action name.

                     PublishMetricAction -> (structure)
                        Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the spec-
                        ified  metrics  to  Amazon CloudWatch for the matching
                        packet. This setting defines  a  CloudWatch  dimension
                        value to be published.

                        You  can pair this custom action with any of the stan-
                        dard stateless rule actions. For  example,  you  could
                        pair  this  in  a rule action with the standard action
                        that forwards  the  packet  for  stateful  inspection.
                        Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall
                        publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it.

                        Dimensions -> (list)
                            (structure)
                               The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom
                               metric  dimension. This is used in the Publish-
                               Metrics   CustomAction .  A  CloudWatch  custom
                               metric  dimension  is  a name/value pair that's
                               part of the identity of a metric.

                               AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to
                               CustomAction  and  you  provide  the  dimension
                               value.

                               For more information  about  CloudWatch  custom
                               metric  dimensions,  see Publishing Custom Met-
                               rics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value  to  use  in  the  custom  metric
                                   dimension.

          StatefulRuleGroupReferences -> (list)
              References to the stateful rule groups that are used in the pol-
              icy. These define the inspection criteria in stateful rules.

              (structure)
                 Identifier for a single stateful rule group, used in a  fire-
                 wall policy to refer to a rule group.

                 ResourceArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the stateful rule
                     group.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     An integer setting that indicates the order in  which  to
                     run  the stateful rule groups in a single  FirewallPolicy
                     . This setting only applies  to  firewall  policies  that
                     specify  the  STRICT_ORDER  rule  order  in  the stateful
                     engine options settings.

                     Network  Firewall  evalutes  each  stateful  rule   group
                     against  a  packet  starting  with the group that has the
                     lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the  prior-
                     ity settings are unique within each policy.

                     You  can change the priority settings of your rule groups
                     at any time. To make it  easier  to  insert  rule  groups
                     later,  number  them  so there's a wide range in between,
                     for example use 100, 200, and so on.

                 Override -> (structure)
                     The action that allows the policy owner to  override  the
                     behavior of the rule group within a policy.

                     Action -> (string)
                        The  action  that  changes the rule group from DROP to
                        ALERT . This only applies to managed rule groups.

          StatefulDefaultActions -> (list)
              The default actions to take on a packet that doesn't  match  any
              stateful  rules. The stateful default action is optional, and is
              only valid when using the strict rule order.

              Valid values of the stateful default action:

              o aws:drop_strict

              o aws:drop_established

              o aws:alert_strict

              o aws:alert_established

              For more information, see Strict evaluation  order  in  the  AWS
              Network Firewall Developer Guide .

              (string)

          StatefulEngineOptions -> (structure)
              Additional options governing how Network Firewall handles state-
              ful rules. The stateful rule groups that you use in your  policy
              must  have  stateful  rule  options settings that are compatible
              with these settings.

              RuleOrder -> (string)
                 Indicates how to manage the order of stateful rule evaluation
                 for the policy. DEFAULT_ACTION_ORDER is the default behavior.
                 Stateful rules are provided to the rule  engine  as  Suricata
                 compatible strings, and Suricata evaluates them based on cer-
                 tain settings. For more information, see Evaluation order for
                 stateful  rules in the AWS Network Firewall Developer Guide .

       --description (string)
          A description of the firewall policy.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the valid-
          ity of the request, rather than run the request.

          If set to TRUE , Network Firewall checks whether the request can run
          successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested  changes.  The
          call  returns  the value that the request would return if you ran it
          with dry run set to FALSE , but doesn't make additions or changes to
          your  resources.  This  option allows you to make sure that you have
          the required permissions to run the request and  that  your  request
          parameters are valid.

          If  set  to  FALSE , Network Firewall makes the requested changes to
          your resources.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UpdateToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic  locking.  Network  Firewall  returns  a
          token  to  your  requests that access the firewall policy. The token
          marks the state of the policy resource at the time of the request.

          To make changes to  the  policy,  you  provide  the  token  in  your
          request.  Network  Firewall uses the token to ensure that the policy
          hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has  changed,  the
          operation  fails  with  an  InvalidTokenException . If this happens,
          retrieve the firewall policy again to get a current copy of it  with
          current  token.  Reapply your changes as needed, then try the opera-
          tion again using the new token.

       FirewallPolicyResponse -> (structure)
          The high-level properties of a firewall policy. This, along with the
          FirewallPolicy , define the policy. You can retrieve all objects for
          a firewall policy by calling  DescribeFirewallPolicy .

          FirewallPolicyName -> (string)
              The descriptive name of the firewall policy.  You  can't  change
              the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          FirewallPolicyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

              NOTE:
                 If  this response is for a create request that had DryRun set
                 to TRUE , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't  attached
                 to a valid resource.

          FirewallPolicyId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the firewall policy.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the firewall policy.

          FirewallPolicyStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the firewall policy. You can retrieve this
              for a firewall policy  by  calling   DescribeFirewallPolicy  and
              providing the firewall policy's name or ARN.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair  associated  with  an  AWS  resource.  The
                 key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag
                 key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag
                 value represents a specific value within that category  (such
                 as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to
                 50 tags to each AWS resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can  use a tag key to describe a category of information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.
