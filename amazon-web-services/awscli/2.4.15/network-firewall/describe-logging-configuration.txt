NAME
       describe-logging-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the logging configuration for the specified firewall.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-logging-configuration
          [--firewall-arn <value>]
          [--firewall-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FirewallArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

       LoggingConfiguration -> (structure)
          Defines how AWS Network Firewall performs logging for a  Firewall  .

          LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
              Defines  the  logging  destinations for the logs for a firewall.
              Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups.

              (structure)
                 Defines where AWS Network Firewall sends logs for  the  fire-
                 wall  for one log type. This is used in  LoggingConfiguration
                 . You can send each type of log to an  Amazon  S3  bucket,  a
                 CloudWatch  log  group,  or  a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery
                 stream.

                 Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups. You
                 can  save alert and flow log types. The stateful rules engine
                 records flow logs for all network traffic that  it  receives.
                 It records alert logs for traffic that matches stateful rules
                 that have the rule action set to DROP or ALERT .

                 LogType -> (string)
                     The type of log to send. Alert logs report  traffic  that
                     matches a  StatefulRule with an action setting that sends
                     an alert log message.  Flow  logs  are  standard  network
                     traffic flow logs.

                 LogDestinationType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  storage destination to send these logs to.
                     You can send logs to an Amazon S3  bucket,  a  CloudWatch
                     log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

                 LogDestination -> (map)
                     The  named location for the logs, provided in a key:value
                     mapping that is specific to the chosen destination  type.

                     o For  an  Amazon  S3  bucket,  provide  the  name of the
                       bucket, with key bucketName , and optionally provide  a
                       prefix,  with key prefix . The following example speci-
                       fies an Amazon S3 bucket named  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET  and
                       the prefix alerts :   "LogDestination": { "bucketName":
                       "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET", "prefix": "alerts" }

                     o For a CloudWatch log group, provide  the  name  of  the
                       CloudWatch log group, with key logGroup . The following
                       example specifies a log group named  alert-log-group  :
                       "LogDestination": { "logGroup": "alert-log-group" }

                     o For  a  Kinesis  Data Firehose delivery stream, provide
                       the name of the delivery stream,  with  key  deliveryS-
                       tream  .  The  following  example  specifies a delivery
                       stream  named  alert-delivery-stream  :    "LogDestina-
                       tion": { "deliveryStream": "alert-delivery-stream" }

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)
