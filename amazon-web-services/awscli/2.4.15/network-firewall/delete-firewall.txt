DELETE-FIREWALL()                                            DELETE-FIREWALL()



NAME
       delete-firewall -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified  Firewall and its  FirewallStatus . This opera-
       tion requires the firewall's DeleteProtection flag to be  FALSE  .  You
       can't revert this operation.

       You  can  check  whether  a  firewall  is in use by reviewing the route
       tables for the Availability Zones where you have firewall  subnet  map-
       pings.  Retrieve the subnet mappings by calling  DescribeFirewall . You
       define and update the route  tables  through  Amazon  VPC.  As  needed,
       update the route tables for the zones to remove the firewall endpoints.
       When the route tables no longer use the  firewall  endpoints,  you  can
       remove the firewall safely.

       To delete a firewall, remove the delete protection if you need to using
       UpdateFirewallDeleteProtection , then delete the  firewall  by  calling
       DeleteFirewall .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-firewall
          [--firewall-name <value>]
          [--firewall-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Firewall -> (structure)
          The firewall defines the configuration settings for an  AWS  Network
          Firewall  firewall.  These settings include the firewall policy, the
          subnets in your VPC to use for the firewall endpoints, and any  tags
          that are attached to the firewall AWS resource.

          The status of the firewall, for example whether it's ready to filter
          network traffic, is provided in the corresponding  FirewallStatus  .
          You can retrieve both objects by calling  DescribeFirewall .

          FirewallName -> (string)
              The  descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name
              of a firewall after you create it.

          FirewallArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          FirewallPolicyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

              The relationship of firewall to firewall policy is many to  one.
              Each  firewall requires one firewall policy association, and you
              can use the same firewall policy for multiple firewalls.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the VPC where the firewall is in use.

          SubnetMappings -> (list)
              The public subnets that Network Firewall is using for the  fire-
              wall.  Each subnet must belong to a different Availability Zone.

              (structure)
                 The ID for a subnet that you want to associate with the fire-
                 wall. This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets
                 . AWS Network Firewall creates an instance of the  associated
                 firewall  in  each subnet that you specify, to filter traffic
                 in the subnet's Availability Zone.

                 SubnetId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the subnet.

          DeleteProtection -> (boolean)
              A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall.
              A  setting  of  TRUE  indicates  that  the firewall is protected
              against deletion. Use this setting to protect  against  acciden-
              tally  deleting  a  firewall  that  is in use. When you create a
              firewall, the operation initializes this flag to TRUE .

          SubnetChangeProtection -> (boolean)
              A setting indicating whether the firewall is  protected  against
              changes  to the subnet associations. Use this setting to protect
              against accidentally modifying the  subnet  associations  for  a
              firewall  that is in use. When you create a firewall, the opera-
              tion initializes this setting to TRUE .

          FirewallPolicyChangeProtection -> (boolean)
              A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against a
              change  to  the firewall policy association. Use this setting to
              protect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a
              firewall  that is in use. When you create a firewall, the opera-
              tion initializes this setting to TRUE .

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the firewall.

          FirewallId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the firewall.

          Tags -> (list)
              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair  associated  with  an  AWS  resource.  The
                 key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag
                 key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag
                 value  represents a specific value within that category (such
                 as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to
                 50 tags to each AWS resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag key to describe a category of  information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category,  such  as  "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values
                     are case-sensitive.

       FirewallStatus -> (structure)
          Detailed information about the current status of a  Firewall  .  You
          can  retrieve  this  for a firewall by calling  DescribeFirewall and
          providing the firewall name and ARN.

          Status -> (string)
              The readiness of the configured firewall to handle network traf-
              fic across all of the Availability Zones where you've configured
              it. This setting is READY only when the  ConfigurationSyncState-
              Summary  value  is IN_SYNC and the Attachment  Status values for
              all of the configured subnets are READY .

          ConfigurationSyncStateSummary -> (string)
              The configuration sync state for the firewall.  This  summarizes
              the  sync  states reported in the Config settings for all of the
              Availability Zones where you have configured the firewall.

              When you create a firewall  or  update  its  configuration,  for
              example  by  adding a rule group to its firewall policy, Network
              Firewall distributes the  configuration  changes  to  all  zones
              where the firewall is in use. This summary indicates whether the
              configuration changes have been applied everywhere.

              This status must be IN_SYNC for the firewall  to  be  ready  for
              use,  but  it  doesn't  indicate that the firewall is ready. The
              Status setting indicates firewall readiness.

          SyncStates -> (map)
              The subnets that you've configured for use by the Network  Fire-
              wall  firewall. This contains one array element per Availability
              Zone where you've configured a  subnet.  These  objects  provide
              details  of the information that is summarized in the Configura-
              tionSyncStateSummary and Status , broken down by zone  and  con-
              figuration object.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 The  status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy con-
                 figuration for a single VPC subnet.

                 For each VPC subnet that you associate with a  firewall,  AWS
                 Network Firewall does the following:

                 o Instantiates  a  firewall  endpoint in the subnet, ready to
                   take traffic.

                 o Configures the endpoint with the  current  firewall  policy
                   settings,  to  provide  the filtering behavior for the end-
                   point.

                 When you update a firewall, for example to add a subnet asso-
                 ciation  or  change  a rule group in the firewall policy, the
                 affected sync states reflect out-of-sync or not ready  status
                 until the changes are complete.

                 Attachment -> (structure)
                     The  attachment status of the firewall's association with
                     a single VPC subnet. For each configured subnet,  Network
                     Firewall  creates  the  attachment  by  instantiating the
                     firewall endpoint in the subnet so  that  it's  ready  to
                     take traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                     SubnetId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier of the subnet that you've speci-
                        fied to be used for a firewall endpoint.

                     EndpointId -> (string)
                        The identifier of the firewall endpoint  that  Network
                        Firewall  has instantiated in the subnet. You use this
                        to identify the firewall endpoint  in  the  VPC  route
                        tables,  when you redirect the VPC traffic through the
                        endpoint.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The current status of the  firewall  endpoint  in  the
                        subnet.  This value reflects both the instantiation of
                        the endpoint in the VPC subnet  and  the  sync  states
                        that  are  reported  in the Config settings. When this
                        value is READY , the endpoint is available and config-
                        ured properly to handle network traffic. When the end-
                        point isn't available for  traffic,  this  value  will
                        reflect  its  state, for example CREATING , DELETING ,
                        or FAILED .

                 Config -> (map)
                     The configuration status of the firewall  endpoint  in  a
                     single  VPC  subnet.  Network Firewall provides each end-
                     point with the rules that are configured in the  firewall
                     policy.  Each time you add a subnet or modify the associ-
                     ated firewall policy, Network Firewall  synchronizes  the
                     rules  in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network
                     traffic. This is part of the  FirewallStatus .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Provides configuration status for a single  policy  or
                        rule  group that is used for a firewall endpoint. Net-
                        work Firewall provides each endpoint  with  the  rules
                        that  are configured in the firewall policy. Each time
                        you add a subnet or  modify  the  associated  firewall
                        policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the
                        endpoint, so it can properly filter  network  traffic.
                        This is part of a  SyncState for a firewall.

                        SyncStatus -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether this object is in sync with the
                            version indicated in the update token.

                        UpdateToken -> (string)
                            The current version of the object that  is  either
                            in sync or pending synchronization.
