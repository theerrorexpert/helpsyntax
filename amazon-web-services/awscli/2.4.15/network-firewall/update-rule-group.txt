UPDATE-RULE-GROUP()                                        UPDATE-RULE-GROUP()



NAME
       update-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the rule settings for the specified rule group. You use a rule
       group by reference in one or more firewall policies. When you modify  a
       rule group, you modify all firewall policies that use the rule group.

       To  update  a rule group, first call  DescribeRuleGroup to retrieve the
       current  RuleGroup object, update the object as needed, and  then  pro-
       vide the updated object to this call.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-rule-group
          --update-token <value>
          [--rule-group-arn <value>]
          [--rule-group-name <value>]
          [--rule-group <value>]
          [--rules <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --update-token (string)
          A  token  used  for  optimistic  locking. Network Firewall returns a
          token to your requests that access the rule group. The  token  marks
          the state of the rule group resource at the time of the request.

          To  make  changes  to  the rule group, you provide the token in your
          request. Network Firewall uses the token to  ensure  that  the  rule
          group hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed,
          the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this happens,
          retrieve  the  rule  group  again to get a current copy of it with a
          current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try  the  opera-
          tion again using the new token.

       --rule-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --rule-group-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of
          a rule group after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --rule-group (structure)
          An object that defines the rule group rules.

          NOTE:
              You must provide either this rule group setting or a Rules  set-
              ting, but not both.

          RuleVariables -> (structure)
              Settings  that  are  available  for use in the rules in the rule
              group. You can only use these for stateful rule groups.

              IPSets -> (map)
                 A list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR  notation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     A  list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR nota-
                     tion. This is part of a  RuleVariables .

                     Definition -> (list)
                        The list of IP addresses and address ranges,  in  CIDR
                        notation.

                        (string)

              PortSets -> (map)
                 A list of port ranges.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     A  set  of  port  ranges  for  use in the rules in a rule
                     group.

                     Definition -> (list)
                        The set of port ranges.

                        (string)

          RulesSource -> (structure)
              The stateful rules or stateless rules for the rule group.

              RulesString -> (string)
                 Stateful inspection criteria, provided in Suricata compatible
                 intrusion  prevention  system  (IPS)  rules.  Suricata  is an
                 open-source network IPS that includes a  standard  rule-based
                 language for network traffic inspection.

                 These rules contain the inspection criteria and the action to
                 take for traffic that matches the criteria, so this  type  of
                 rule group doesn't have a separate action setting.

              RulesSourceList -> (structure)
                 Stateful inspection criteria for a domain list rule group.

                 Targets -> (list)
                     The  domains that you want to inspect for in your traffic
                     flows. Valid domain specifications are the following:

                     o Explicit names. For  example,  abc.example.com  matches
                       only the domain abc.example.com .

                     o Names  that  use  a domain wildcard, which you indicate
                       with an  initial  '.  '.  For  example,``.example.com``
                       matches example.com and matches all subdomains of exam-
                       ple.com , such as abc.example.com and www.example.com .

                     (string)

                 TargetTypes -> (list)
                     The  protocols  you  want to inspect. Specify TLS_SNI for
                     HTTPS . Specify HTTP_HOST for  HTTP  .  You  can  specify
                     either or both.

                     (string)

                 GeneratedRulesType -> (string)
                     Whether  you  want to allow or deny access to the domains
                     in your target list.

              StatefulRules -> (list)
                 An array of individual stateful rules inspection criteria  to
                 be used together in a stateful rule group. Use this option to
                 specify simple Suricata rules with protocol, source and  des-
                 tination, ports, direction, and rule options. For information
                 about the Suricata Rules format, see Rules Format .

                 (structure)
                     A single Suricata  rules  specification,  for  use  in  a
                     stateful  rule group. Use this option to specify a simple
                     Suricata rule  with  protocol,  source  and  destination,
                     ports, direction, and rule options. For information about
                     the Suricata Rules format, see Rules Format .

                     Action -> (string)
                        Defines what Network Firewall should do with the pack-
                        ets in a traffic flow when the flow matches the state-
                        ful rule criteria. For all actions,  Network  Firewall
                        performs  the specified action and discontinues state-
                        ful inspection of the traffic flow.

                        The actions for a stateful rule are  defined  as  fol-
                        lows:

                        o PASS  -  Permits  the  packets to go to the intended
                          destination.

                        o DROP - Blocks the packets from going to the intended
                          destination and sends an alert log message, if alert
                          logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingCon-
                          figuration .

                        o ALERT  -  Permits  the packets to go to the intended
                          destination and sends an alert log message, if alert
                          logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingCon-
                          figuration .  You can use this action to test a rule
                          that  you  intend  to  use  to drop traffic. You can
                          enable the rule with ALERT  action,  verify  in  the
                          logs  that  the  rule is filtering as you want, then
                          change the action to DROP .

                     Header -> (structure)
                        The stateful inspection criteria for this  rule,  used
                        to inspect traffic flows.

                        Protocol -> (string)
                            The  protocol  to inspect for. To specify all, you
                            can use IP , because all traffic on AWS and on the
                            internet is IP.

                        Source -> (string)
                            The  source IP address or address range to inspect
                            for, in CIDR notation. To match with any  address,
                            specify ANY .

                            Specify  an  IP address or a block of IP addresses
                            in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation.
                            Network  Firewall  supports all address ranges for
                            IPv4.

                            Examples:

                            o To configure Network Firewall to inspect for the
                              IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32 .

                            o To  configure Network Firewall to inspect for IP
                              addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify
                              192.0.2.0/24 .

                            For  more information about CIDR notation, see the
                            Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

                        SourcePort -> (string)
                            The source port to inspect for. You can specify an
                            individual  port,  for  example  1994  and you can
                            specify a port range, for example 1990:1994  .  To
                            match with any port, specify ANY .

                        Direction -> (string)
                            The  direction  of traffic flow to inspect. If set
                            to ANY  ,  the  inspection  matches  bidirectional
                            traffic,  both  from the source to the destination
                            and from the destination to the source. If set  to
                            FORWARD  ,  the  inspection  only  matches traffic
                            going from the source to the destination.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            The destination IP address  or  address  range  to
                            inspect  for,  in CIDR notation. To match with any
                            address, specify ANY .

                            Specify an IP address or a block of  IP  addresses
                            in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation.
                            Network Firewall supports all address  ranges  for
                            IPv4.

                            Examples:

                            o To configure Network Firewall to inspect for the
                              IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32 .

                            o To configure Network Firewall to inspect for  IP
                              addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify
                              192.0.2.0/24 .

                            For more information about CIDR notation, see  the
                            Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

                        DestinationPort -> (string)
                            The destination port to inspect for. You can spec-
                            ify an individual port, for example 1994  and  you
                            can  specify a port range, for example 1990:1994 .
                            To match with any port, specify ANY .

                     RuleOptions -> (list)
                        Additional options for the rule. These are  the  Suri-
                        cata RuleOptions settings.

                        (structure)
                            Additional  settings  for a stateful rule. This is
                            part of the  StatefulRule configuration.

                            Keyword -> (string)

                            Settings -> (list)
                               (string)

              StatelessRulesAndCustomActions -> (structure)
                 Stateless inspection criteria to be used in a stateless  rule
                 group.

                 StatelessRules -> (list)
                     Defines the set of stateless rules for use in a stateless
                     rule group.

                     (structure)
                        A single stateless rule. This is used  in   Stateless-
                        RulesAndCustomActions .

                        RuleDefinition -> (structure)
                            Defines  the  stateless  5-tuple packet inspection
                            criteria and the action to take on a  packet  that
                            matches the criteria.

                            MatchAttributes -> (structure)
                               Criteria for Network Firewall to use to inspect
                               an individual packet in stateless rule  inspec-
                               tion. Each match attributes set can include one
                               or more items such as IP address,  CIDR  range,
                               port number, protocol, and TCP flags.

                               Sources -> (list)
                                   The  source IP addresses and address ranges
                                   to inspect for, in CIDR  notation.  If  not
                                   specified,  this  matches  with  any source
                                   address.

                                          the Masks setting.

                                          For  the flags that are specified in

                               attributes.  You must specify a standard action
                               and you can add custom actions.

                               NOTE:
                                   Network Firewall only forwards a packet for
                                   stateful  rule  inspection  if  you specify
                                   aws:forward_to_sfe  for  a  rule  that  the
                                   packet  matches,  or  if the packet doesn't
                                   match any stateless rule  and  you  specify
                                   aws:forward_to_sfe   for  the  StatelessDe-
                                   faultActions setting for the   FirewallPol-
                                   icy .

                               For every rule, you must specify exactly one of
                               the following standard actions.

                               o aws:pass - Discontinues all inspection of the
                                 packet  and  permits it to go to its intended
                                 destination.

                               o aws:drop - Discontinues all inspection of the
                                 packet  and  blocks  it  from  going  to  its
                                 intended destination.

                               o aws:forward_to_sfe -  Discontinues  stateless
                                 inspection  of  the packet and forwards it to
                                 the stateful rule engine for inspection.

                               Additionally, you can specify a custom  action.
                               To  do this, you define a custom action by name
                               and type, then provide the name you've assigned
                               to  the  action  in  this  Actions setting. For
                               information about the options,  see   CustomAc-
                               tion .

                               To  provide  more  than one action in this set-
                               ting, separate the settings with a  comma.  For
                               example,  if  you  have a custom PublishMetrics
                               action that you've named MyMetricsAction , then
                               you  could specify the standard action aws:pass
                               and the custom action with [aws:pass, MyMetric-
                               sAction] .

                               (string)

                        Priority -> (integer)
                            Indicates the order in which to run this rule rel-
                            ative to all of the rules that are defined  for  a
                            stateless  rule  group. Network Firewall evaluates
                            the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest
                            priority  setting. You must ensure that the prior-
                            ity settings are unique for the rule group.

                            Each stateless rule group uses exactly one  State-
                            lessRulesAndCustomActions  object, and each State-
                            lessRulesAndCustomActions  contains  exactly   one
                            StatelessRules  object.  To ensure unique priority
                            settings for your rule groups, set unique  priori-
                            ties  for  the  stateless  rules  that  you define
                            inside any single StatelessRules object.

                            You can change the priority settings of your rules
                            at  any  time.  To  make it easier to insert rules
                            later, number them so  there's  a  wide  range  in
                            between, for example use 100, 200, and so on.

                 CustomActions -> (list)
                     Defines  an array of individual custom action definitions
                     that are available for use by the stateless rules in this
                     StatelessRulesAndCustomActions  specification.  You  name
                     each custom action that you define, and then you can  use
                     it   by  name  in  your   StatelessRule    RuleDefinition
                     Actions specification.

                        An optional, non-standard action to use for  stateless
                        packet  handling.  You  can define this in addition to
                        the standard action that you must specify.

                        You define and name the custom actions that  you  want
                        to be able to use, and then you reference them by name
                        in your actions settings.

                        You can use custom actions in the following places:

                        o In a  rule  group's   StatelessRulesAndCustomActions
                          specification.  The custom actions are available for
                          use by name  inside  the  StatelessRulesAndCustomAc-
                          tions  where  you  define them. You can use them for
                          your stateless rule actions to specify  what  to  do
                          with   a   packet  that  matches  the  rule's  match
                          attributes.

                        o In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in StatelessCus-
                          tomActions  .  The  custom actions are available for
                          use inside the policy where you define them. You can
                          use  them for the policy's default stateless actions
                          settings to specify what to  do  with  packets  that
                          don't match any of the policy's stateless rules.

                        ActionName -> (string)
                            The  descriptive  name  of  the custom action. You
                            can't change the name of a custom action after you
                            create it.

                        ActionDefinition -> (structure)
                            The custom action associated with the action name.

                            PublishMetricAction -> (structure)
                               Stateless inspection  criteria  that  publishes
                               the  specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for
                               the matching packet.  This  setting  defines  a
                               CloudWatch dimension value to be published.

                               You can pair this custom action with any of the
                               standard stateless rule actions.  For  example,
                               you  could  pair this in a rule action with the
                               standard action that forwards  the  packet  for
                               stateful   inspection.   Then,  when  a  packet
                               matches the rule,  Network  Firewall  publishes
                               metrics for the packet and forwards it.

                               Dimensions -> (list)
                                   (structure)
                                      The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch
                                      custom metric dimension. This is used in
                                      the  PublishMetrics    CustomAction  . A
                                      CloudWatch custom metric dimension is  a
                                      name/value pair that's part of the iden-
                                      tity of a metric.

                                      AWS Network Firewall sets the  dimension
                                      name to CustomAction and you provide the
                                      dimension value.

                                      For more  information  about  CloudWatch
                                      custom metric dimensions, see Publishing
                                      Custom Metrics in the Amazon  CloudWatch
                                      User Guide .

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The  value to use in the custom met-
                                          ric dimension.

          StatefulRuleOptions -> (structure)
              Additional options governing how Network Firewall handles state-
              ful  rules.  The policies where you use your stateful rule group
              must have stateful rule options  settings  that  are  compatible
              with these settings.

              RuleOrder -> (string)
                 Indicates  how to manage the order of the rule evaluation for
                 the rule group. DEFAULT_ACTION_ORDER is the default behavior.
                 Stateful  rules  are  provided to the rule engine as Suricata
                 compatible strings, and Suricata evaluates them based on cer-
                 tain settings. For more information, see Evaluation order for
                 stateful rules in the AWS Network Firewall Developer Guide  .

       --rules (string)
          A  string  containing  stateful  rule  group rules specifications in
          Suricata flat format, with one rule per line.  Use  this  to  import
          your existing Suricata compatible rule groups.

          NOTE:
              You  must provide either this rules setting or a populated Rule-
              Group setting, but not both.

          You can provide your rule group specification in Suricata flat  for-
          mat  through this setting when you create or update your rule group.
          The call response returns a  RuleGroup object that Network  Firewall
          has populated from your string.

       --type (string)
          Indicates  whether  the  rule group is stateless or stateful. If the
          rule group is stateless, it  contains  stateless  rules.  If  it  is
          stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          NOTE:
              This  setting  is  required for requests that do not include the
              RuleGroupARN .

          Possible values:

          o STATELESS

          o STATEFUL

       --description (string)
          A description of the rule group.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the valid-
          ity of the request, rather than run the request.

          If set to TRUE , Network Firewall checks whether the request can run
          successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested  changes.  The
          call  returns  the value that the request would return if you ran it
          with dry run set to FALSE , but doesn't make additions or changes to
          your  resources.  This  option allows you to make sure that you have
          the required permissions to run the request and  that  your  request
          parameters are valid.

          If  set  to  FALSE , Network Firewall makes the requested changes to
          your resources.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UpdateToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic  locking.  Network  Firewall  returns  a
          token  to  your requests that access the rule group. The token marks
          the state of the rule group resource at the time of the request.

          To make changes to the rule group, you provide  the  token  in  your
          request.  Network  Firewall  uses  the token to ensure that the rule
          group hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed,
          the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this happens,
          retrieve the rule group again to get a current copy  of  it  with  a
          current  token.  Reapply your changes as needed, then try the opera-
          tion again using the new token.

       RuleGroupResponse -> (structure)
          The high-level properties of a rule  group.  This,  along  with  the
          RuleGroup  , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for
          a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup .

          RuleGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

              NOTE:
                 If this response is for a create request that had DryRun  set
                 to  TRUE , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached
                 to a valid resource.

          RuleGroupName -> (string)
              The descriptive name of the rule group.  You  can't  change  the
              name of a rule group after you create it.

          RuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the rule group.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the rule group.

          Type -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  the  rule group is stateless or stateful. If
              the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If  it
              is stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          Capacity -> (integer)
              The  maximum  operating  resources that this rule group can use.
              Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule
              group,  you  are  limited to this capacity. When you reference a
              rule group from a firewall  policy,  Network  Firewall  reserves
              this capacity for the rule group.

              You  can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule
              group before you create the rule group by  calling   CreateRule-
              Group with DryRun set to TRUE .

          RuleGroupStatus -> (string)
              Detailed information about the current status of a rule group.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair  associated  with  an  AWS  resource.  The
                 key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag
                 key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag
                 value represents a specific value within that category  (such
                 as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to
                 50 tags to each AWS resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can  use a tag key to describe a category of information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
