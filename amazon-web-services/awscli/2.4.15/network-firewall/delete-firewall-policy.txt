NAME

DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-firewall-policy
          [--firewall-policy-name <value>]
          [--firewall-policy-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-policy-name (string)
          The  descriptive  name  of the firewall policy. You can't change the
          name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FirewallPolicyResponse -> (structure)
          The object containing the definition of the   FirewallPolicyResponse
          that you asked to delete.

          FirewallPolicyName -> (string)
              The  descriptive  name  of the firewall policy. You can't change
              the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          FirewallPolicyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

              NOTE:
                 If this response is for a create request that had DryRun  set
                 to  TRUE , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached
                 to a valid resource.

          FirewallPolicyId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the firewall policy.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the firewall policy.

          FirewallPolicyStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the firewall policy. You can retrieve this
              for  a  firewall  policy  by calling  DescribeFirewallPolicy and
              providing the firewall policy's name or ARN.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair  associated  with  an  AWS  resource.  The
                 key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag
                 key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag
                 value  represents a specific value within that category (such
                 as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to
                 50 tags to each AWS resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag key to describe a category of  information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category,  such  as  "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values
                     are case-sensitive.

          ConsumedStatelessRuleCapacity -> (integer)
              The number of capacity units currently consumed by the  policy's
              stateless rules.

          ConsumedStatefulRuleCapacity -> (integer)
              The  number of capacity units currently consumed by the policy's
              stateful rules.

          NumberOfAssociations -> (integer)
              The number of firewalls that are associated with  this  firewall
              policy.
