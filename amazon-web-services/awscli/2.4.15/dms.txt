DESCRIPTION
       Database  Migration Service (DMS) can migrate your data to and from the
       most widely used commercial and open-source databases such  as  Oracle,
       PostgreSQL,  Microsoft  SQL  Server,  Amazon  Redshift, MariaDB, Amazon
       Aurora, MySQL, and SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise  (ASE).  The  service
       supports  homogeneous  migrations  such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as
       heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such  as
       Oracle to MySQL or SQL Server to PostgreSQL.

       For more information about DMS, see What Is Database Migration Service?
       in the Database Migration Service User Guide.
