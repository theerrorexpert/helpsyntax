SYNOPSIS
            get-alternate-contact
          [--account-id <value>]
          --alternate-contact-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          Specifies  the 12 digit account ID number of the Amazon Web Services
          account that you want to access or modify with this operation.

          If you do not specify this parameter, it defaults to the Amazon  Web
          Services account of the identity used to call the operation.

          To  use  this  parameter,  the  caller  must  be  an identity in the
          organization's  management  account  or  a  delegated  administrator
          account,  and  the  specified account ID must be a member account in
          the same organization.  The  organization  must  have  all  features
          enabled  , and the organization must have trusted access enabled for
          the Account Management service, and  optionally  a  delegated  admin
          account assigned.

          NOTE:
              The management account can't specify its own AccountId ; it must
              call the operation in standalone context by  not  including  the
              AccountId parameter.

          To  call  this  operation  on  an account that is not a member of an
          organization, then don't specify this parameter, and call the opera-
          tion  using  an identity belonging to the account whose contacts you
          wish to retrieve or modify.

       --alternate-contact-type (string)
          Specifies which alternate contact you want to retrieve.

          Possible values:

          o BILLING

          o OPERATIONS

          o SECURITY

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
