NAME
       list-coverage-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists Amazon Inspector coverage statistics for your environment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-coverage-statistics  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: countsByGroup

       --group-by (string)
          The value to group the results by.

          Possible values:

          o SCAN_STATUS_CODE

          o SCAN_STATUS_REASON

          o ACCOUNT_ID

          o RESOURCE_TYPE

          o ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       countsByGroup -> (list)
          An array with the number for each group.

          (structure)
              a  structure that contains information on the count of resources
              within a group.

              count -> (long)
                 The number of resources.

              groupKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with this group

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token to use for paginating  results  that  are  returned  in  the
          response.  Set  the  value  of  this parameter to null for the first
          request to a list action. For subsequent calls,  use  the  NextToken
          value returned from the previous request to continue listing results
          after the first page.

       totalCounts -> (long)
          The total number for all groups.
