       --report-format (string)
          The format to generate the report in.

          Possible values:

          o CSV

          o JSON

       --s3-destination (structure)
          The Amazon S3 export destination for the report.

          bucketName -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to export findings to.

          keyPrefix -> (string)
              The prefix of the KMS key used to export findings.

          kmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt data when exporting find-
              ings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string,keyPrefix=string,kmsKeyArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucketName": "string",
            "keyPrefix": "string",
            "kmsKeyArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       reportId -> (string)
          The ID of the report.
