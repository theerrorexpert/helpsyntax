NAME
       get-domain-deliverability-campaign -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve all the deliverability data for a specific campaign. This data
       is available for a campaign only if the campaign sent email by using  a
       domain that the Deliverability dashboard is enabled for.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-deliverability-campaign
          --campaign-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --campaign-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the campaign. The Deliverability dashboard
          automatically generates and assigns this identifier to a campaign.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              determine  how  long  it took for a campaign to deliver an email
              message.

          InboxCount -> (long)

              using an email client that supports images.

          ReadDeleteRate -> (double)
