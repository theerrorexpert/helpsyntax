          This API is for the identity owner only. If you  have  not  verified
          the identity, this API will return an error.

       Sending  authorization  is  a feature that enables an identity owner to
       authorize other senders to use its identities.  For  information  about
       using sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

SYNOPSIS
            create-email-identity-policy
          --email-identity <value>
          --policy-name <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email identity.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy.

          The  policy  name  cannot  exceed 64 characters and can only include
          alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.

       --policy (string)
          The text of the policy in JSON format. The policy  cannot  exceed  4
          KB.

          For  information about the syntax of sending authorization policies,
          see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
