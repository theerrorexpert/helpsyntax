NAME
       list-import-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all of the import jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-import-jobs
          [--import-destination-type <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --import-destination-type (string)
          The  destination of the import job, which can be used to list import
          jobs that have a certain ImportDestinationType .

          Possible values:

          o SUPPRESSION_LIST

          o CONTACT_LIST

       --next-token (string)
          A string token indicating that there might be additional import jobs
          available  to  be  listed.  Copy  this token to a subsequent call to
          ListImportJobs with the same parameters to retrieve the next page of
          import jobs.

       --page-size (integer)
          Maximum  number of import jobs to return at once. Use this parameter
          to paginate results. If additional  import  jobs  exist  beyond  the
          specified  limit, the NextToken element is sent in the response. Use
          the NextToken value in subsequent requests  to  retrieve  additional
          addresses.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ImportJobs -> (list)
          A list of the import job summaries.

              ImportDestination -> (structure)
                 An  object  that contains details about the resource destina-
                 tion the import job is going to target.

                 SuppressionListDestination -> (structure)
                     An object that contains the  action  of  the  import  job

                          the  record already exists, it will override it with
                          the new value.

                        o DELETE: remove the addresses  from  the  suppression
                          list.

                 ContactListDestination -> (structure)
                     An  object  that  contains  the  action of the import job

                        The name of the contact list.

                     ContactListImportAction -> (string)
                        >The type of action to perform on the  addresses.  The
                        following are the possible values:

                        o PUT:  add  the addresses to the contact list. If the

                        o DELETE:  remove the addresses from the contact list.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the import job.

              CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the import job was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A string token indicating that there might be additional import jobs
          available  to  be  listed.  Copy  this token to a subsequent call to
          ListImportJobs with the same parameters to retrieve the next page of
          import jobs.
