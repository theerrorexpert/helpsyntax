       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-contact-lists
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          Maximum  number of contact lists to return at once. Use this parame-
          ter to paginate results. If additional contact  lists  exist  beyond
          the  specified limit, the NextToken element is sent in the response.
          Use the NextToken value in subsequent  requests  to  retrieve  addi-
          tional lists.

       --next-token (string)
          A  string  token  indicating  that there might be additional contact
          lists available to be listed. Use the token provided in the Response
          to  use  in  the  subsequent  call to ListContactLists with the same
          parameters to retrieve the next page of contact lists.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContactLists -> (list)
          The available contact lists.

          (structure)
              A list that contains contacts that have subscribed to a particu-
              lar topic or topics.

              ContactListName -> (string)
                 The name of the contact list.

              LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  noting  the  last  time  the  contact  list was
                 updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A string token indicating that there  might  be  additional  contact
          lists  available  to be listed. Copy this token to a subsequent call
          to ListContactLists with the same parameters to  retrieve  the  next
          page of contact lists.
