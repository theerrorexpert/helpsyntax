LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()                              LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  a list of the tags (keys and values) that are associated with
       a specified resource. A tag is a label that you optionally  define  and
       associate  with a resource. Each tag consists of a required tag key and
       an optional associated tag value . A tag key is a  general  label  that
       acts  as a category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts as a
       descriptor within a tag key.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-for-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  resource  that  you  want  to
          retrieve tag information for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          An  array  that  lists  all  the  tags  that are associated with the
          resource. Each tag consists of a required tag  key  (Key  )  and  an
          associated tag value (Value )

          (structure)
              An  object  that  defines  the  tags  that are associated with a
              resource. A tag is a label that you optionally define and  asso-
              ciate  with  a resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage
              resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environ-
              ment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

              Each tag consists of a required tag key and  an  associated  tag
              value  ,  both of which you define. A tag key is a general label
              that acts as a category for a more specific  tag  value.  A  tag
              value  acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can con-
              tain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as  many
              as  256  characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, dig-
              its, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : /  =  +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For  each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and
                it can have only one value.

              o The aws: prefix is reserved for use by  Amazon  Web  Services;
                you  cant use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In
                addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use
                this  prefix. Tags that use this prefix dont count against the
                limit of 50 tags per resource.

              o You can associate tags with public or  shared  resources,  but
                the  tags  are  available  only  for  your Amazon Web Services
                account, not any other accounts that share  the  resource.  In
                addition,  the  tags are available only for resources that are
                located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region  for  your
                Amazon Web Services account.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum
                 length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length  is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The  minimum
                 length  is 0 characters. If you don't want a resource to have
                 a specific tag value, don't specify a value for this  parame-
                 ter.  If you don't specify a value, Amazon SES sets the value
                 to an empty string.
