          [--start-date <value>]
          [--end-date <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reasons (list)
          The factors that caused the email address to be added to .

          (string)
              The reason that the address was added to  the  suppression  list
              for your account. The value can be one of the following:

              o COMPLAINT   Amazon  SES added an email address to the suppres-
                sion list for your account because  a  message  sent  to  that
                address results in a complaint.

              o BOUNCE   Amazon  SES added an email address to the suppression
                list for your account because a message sent to  that  address
                results in a hard bounce.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            BOUNCE
            COMPLAINT

       --start-date (timestamp)
          Used  to filter the list of suppressed email destinations so that it
          only includes addresses that were added to the list after a specific
          date. The date that you specify should be in Unix time format.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          Used  to filter the list of suppressed email destinations so that it
          only includes addresses that were added to the list  before  a  spe-
          cific date. The date that you specify should be in Unix time format.

       --next-token (string)
          A token returned from a previous call to  ListSuppressedDestinations
          to  indicate the position in the list of suppressed email addresses.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of results to show in a single call to ListSuppressedDes-
          tinations  .  If the number of results is larger than the number you
          specified in this parameter, then the response includes a  NextToken
          element, which you can use to obtain additional results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SuppressedDestinationSummaries -> (list)
          A  list  of  summaries,  each  containing a summary for a suppressed

              Reason -> (string)
                 The reason that the address was added to the suppression list
                 for your account.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the suppressed  destination  was  last
                 updated, shown in Unix time format.

          A  token that indicates that there are additional email addresses on
          the suppression list for your account. To view additional suppressed
          addresses, issue another request to ListSuppressedDestinations , and
          pass this token in the NextToken parameter.
