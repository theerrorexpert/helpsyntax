CREATE-EMAIL-IDENTITY()                                CREATE-EMAIL-IDENTITY()



NAME
       create-email-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the  process  of verifying an email identity. An identity is an
       email address or domain that you use when you send  email.  Before  you
       can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By ver-
       ifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the  iden-
       tity,  and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email
       from the identity.

       When you verify an email address, Amazon SES  sends  an  email  to  the
       address.  Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link
       in the verification email.

       When you verify a domain without specifying  the  DkimSigningAttributes
       object,  this  operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert
       these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configu-
       ration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects
       these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This  verifica-
       tion method is known as Easy DKIM .

       Alternatively,  you  can  perform the verification process by providing
       your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known  as
       Bring  Your  Own  DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the Cre-
       ateEmailIdentity operation has  to  include  the  DkimSigningAttributes
       object.  When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a compo-
       nent of the DNS record name that identifies the public key to  use  for
       DKIM authentication) and a private key.

       When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens,
       which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens  to
       the  DNS  configuration  for  your domain. Your domain is verified when
       Amazon SES detects these records in  the  DNS  configuration  for  your
       domain.  For  some  DNS providers, it can take 72 hours or more to com-
       plete the domain verification process.

       Additionally, you can associate an existing configuration set with  the
       email identity that you're verifying.

SYNOPSIS
            create-email-identity
          --email-identity <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--dkim-signing-attributes <value>]
          [--configuration-set-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email address or domain to verify.

       --tags (list)
          An  array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) to asso-
          ciate with the email identity.

          (structure)
              An object that defines the  tags  that  are  associated  with  a
              resource.  A tag is a label that you optionally define and asso-
              ciate with a resource. Tags can help you categorize  and  manage
              resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environ-
              ment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

              Each  tag  consists  of a required tag key and an associated tag
              value , both of which you define. A tag key is a  general  label
              that  acts  as  a  category for a more specific tag value. A tag
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can  con-
              tain  as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many
              as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode  letters,  dig-
              its,  white  space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique  and
                it can have only one value.

              o The  aws:  prefix  is reserved for use by Amazon Web Services;
                you cant use it in any tag keys or values that you define.  In
                addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use
                this prefix. Tags that use this prefix dont count against  the
                limit of 50 tags per resource.

              o You  can  associate  tags with public or shared resources, but
                the tags are available  only  for  your  Amazon  Web  Services
                account,  not  any  other accounts that share the resource. In
                addition, the tags are available only for resources  that  are
                located  in  the specified Amazon Web Services Region for your
                Amazon Web Services account.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The  maximum
                 length  of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum  length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum
                 length is 0 characters. If you don't want a resource to  have
                 a  specific tag value, don't specify a value for this parame-
                 ter. If you don't specify a value, Amazon SES sets the  value
                 to an empty string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dkim-signing-attributes (structure)
          If  your  request  includes  this  object, Amazon SES configures the
          identity to use Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM) for  DKIM  authentica-
          tion  purposes,  or,  configures  the key length to be used for Easy
          DKIM .

          You can only specify this object if the email identity is a  domain,
          as opposed to an address.

          DomainSigningSelector -> (string)
              [Bring  Your Own DKIM] A string that's used to identify a public
              key in the DNS configuration for a domain.

          DomainSigningPrivateKey -> (string)
              [Bring Your Own DKIM] A private key that's used  to  generate  a
              DKIM signature.

              The  private  key  must use 1024 or 2048-bit RSA encryption, and
              must be encoded using base64 encoding.

          NextSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy DKIM] The key length of the future DKIM  key  pair  to  be
              generated. This can be changed at most once per day.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DomainSigningSelector=string,DomainSigningPrivateKey=string,NextSigningKeyLength=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DomainSigningSelector": "string",
            "DomainSigningPrivateKey": "string",
            "NextSigningKeyLength": "RSA_1024_BIT"|"RSA_2048_BIT"
          }

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The configuration set to use by default when sending from this iden-
          tity. Note that any configuration set defined in the  email  sending
          request takes precedence.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityType -> (string)
          The  email  identity type. Note: the MANAGED_DOMAIN identity type is
          not supported.

       VerifiedForSendingStatus -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether or not the identity is verified. You can only send
          email from verified email addresses or domains. For more information
          about verifying identities, see the Amazon Pinpoint User Guide .

       DkimAttributes -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about the  DKIM  attributes  for
          the identity.

          SigningEnabled -> (boolean)
              If  the value is true , then the messages that you send from the
              identity are signed using DKIM. If the value is false , then the
              messages that you send from the identity aren't DKIM-signed.

          Status -> (string)
              Describes whether or not Amazon SES has successfully located the
              DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The  status  can
              be one of the following:

              o PENDING   The  verification  process was initiated, but Amazon
                SES hasn't yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configura-
                tion for the domain.

              o SUCCESS  The verification process completed successfully.

              o FAILED  The verification process failed. This typically occurs
                when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS con-
                figuration of the domain.

              o TEMPORARY_FAILURE   A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES
                from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.

              o NOT_STARTED   The DKIM verification process hasn't been initi-
                ated for the domain.

          Tokens -> (list)
              If you used Easy DKIM to configure DKIM authentication  for  the
              domain,  then  this object contains a set of unique strings that
              you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS
              configuration  for  your  domain.  When Amazon SES detects these
              records in the DNS  configuration  for  your  domain,  the  DKIM
              authentication process is complete.

              If  you configured DKIM authentication for the domain by provid-
              ing your own public-private key pair, then this object  contains
              the selector for the public key.

              Regardless of the DKIM authentication method you use, Amazon SES
              searches for the appropriate records in the DNS configuration of
              the domain for up to 72 hours.

              (string)

          SigningAttributesOrigin -> (string)
              A  string  that  indicates how DKIM was configured for the iden-
              tity. These are the possible values:

              o AWS_SES  Indicates that DKIM was configured for  the  identity
                by using Easy DKIM .

              o EXTERNAL   Indicates that DKIM was configured for the identity
                by using Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM).

          NextSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy DKIM] The key length of the future DKIM  key  pair  to  be
              generated. This can be changed at most once per day.

          CurrentSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy DKIM] The key length of the DKIM key pair in use.

          LastKeyGenerationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              [Easy  DKIM]  The  last  time  a key pair was generated for this
              identity.
