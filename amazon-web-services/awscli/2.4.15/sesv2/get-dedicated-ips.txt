NAME
       get-dedicated-ips -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  dedicated  IP addresses that are associated with your Amazon
       Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-dedicated-ips
          [--pool-name <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pool-name (string)
          The name of the IP pool that the dedicated IP address is  associated
          with.

       --next-token (string)
          A token returned from a previous call to GetDedicatedIps to indicate
          the position of the dedicated IP pool in the list of IP pools.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of results to show in a single call to GetDedicatedIpsRe-
          quest . If the number of results is larger than the number you spec-
          ified in this parameter, then the response includes a NextToken ele-
          ment, which you can use to obtain additional results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DedicatedIps -> (list)
          A  list of dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your Ama-
          zon Web Services account.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a dedicated IP address that is  asso-
              ciated with your Amazon SES account.

              To  learn  more  about  requesting  dedicated  IP addresses, see
              Requesting and Relinquishing Dedicated IP Addresses in the  Ama-
              zon SES Developer Guide .

              Ip -> (string)
                 An IPv4 address.

              WarmupStatus -> (string)
                 The  warm-up status of a dedicated IP address. The status can
                 have one of the following values:

                 o IN_PROGRESS  The IP address isn't ready to use because  the
                   dedicated IP warm-up process is ongoing.

                 o DONE  The dedicated IP warm-up process is complete, and the
                   IP address is ready to use.

              WarmupPercentage -> (integer)
                 Indicates how complete the dedicated IP warm-up  process  is.
                 When  this  value  equals  1,  the  address has completed the
                 warm-up process and is ready for use.

              PoolName -> (string)
                 The name of the dedicated IP pool  that  the  IP  address  is
                 associated with.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  that  there  are  additional dedicated IP
          addresses to list.  To  view  additional  addresses,  issue  another
          request  to  GetDedicatedIps  ,  passing this token in the NextToken
          parameter.
