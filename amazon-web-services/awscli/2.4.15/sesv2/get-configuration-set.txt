GET-CONFIGURATION-SET()                                GET-CONFIGURATION-SET()



NAME
       get-configuration-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Get information about an existing configuration set, including the ded-
       icated IP pool that it's associated with, whether or not  it's  enabled
       for sending email, and more.
          Configuration  sets  are  groups  of rules that you can apply to the
          emails you send. You apply  a  configuration  set  to  an  email  by
          including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the
          email. When you apply a configuration set to an email,  all  of  the
          rules in that configuration set are applied to the email.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-configuration-set
          --configuration-set-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConfigurationSetName -> (string)
          The name of the configuration set.

       TrackingOptions -> (structure)
          An  object  that  defines  the  open  and click tracking options for
          emails that you send using the configuration set.

          CustomRedirectDomain -> (string)
              The domain to use for tracking open and click events.

       DeliveryOptions -> (structure)
          An object that defines the dedicated IP pool that is  used  to  send
          emails that you send using the configuration set.

          TlsPolicy -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  messages  that use the configuration set are
              required to use Transport Layer Security (TLS). If the value  is
              Require , messages are only delivered if a TLS connection can be
              established. If the value is Optional , messages can  be  deliv-
              ered in plain text if a TLS connection can't be established.

          SendingPoolName -> (string)
              The name of the dedicated IP pool to associate with the configu-
              ration set.

       ReputationOptions -> (structure)
          An object that defines whether or not Amazon SES collects reputation
          metrics for the emails that you send that use the configuration set.

          ReputationMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
              If true , tracking of reputation metrics is enabled for the con-
              figuration  set.  If  false  , tracking of reputation metrics is
              disabled for the configuration set.

          LastFreshStart -> (timestamp)
              The date and time (in Unix time)  when  the  reputation  metrics
              were  last  given  a  fresh  start. When your account is given a
              fresh start, your reputation  metrics  are  calculated  starting
              from the date of the fresh start.

       SendingOptions -> (structure)
          An object that defines whether or not Amazon SES can send email that
          you send using the configuration set.

          SendingEnabled -> (boolean)
              If true , email sending is enabled for the configuration set. If
              false , email sending is disabled for the configuration set.

       Tags -> (list)
          An  array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that are
          associated with the configuration set.

          (structure)
              An object that defines the  tags  that  are  associated  with  a
              resource.  A tag is a label that you optionally define and asso-
              ciate with a resource. Tags can help you categorize  and  manage
              resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environ-
              ment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

              Each  tag  consists  of a required tag key and an associated tag
              value , both of which you define. A tag key is a  general  label
              that  acts  as  a  category for a more specific tag value. A tag
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can  con-
              tain  as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many
              as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode  letters,  dig-
              its,  white  space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique  and
                it can have only one value.

              o The  aws:  prefix  is reserved for use by Amazon Web Services;
                you cant use it in any tag keys or values that you define.  In
                addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use
                this prefix. Tags that use this prefix dont count against  the
                limit of 50 tags per resource.

              o You  can  associate  tags with public or shared resources, but
                the tags are available  only  for  your  Amazon  Web  Services
                account,  not  any  other accounts that share the resource. In
                addition, the tags are available only for resources  that  are
                located  in  the specified Amazon Web Services Region for your
                Amazon Web Services account.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The  maximum
                 length  of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum  length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum
                 length is 0 characters. If you don't want a resource to  have
                 a  specific tag value, don't specify a value for this parame-
                 ter. If you don't specify a value, Amazon SES sets the  value
                 to an empty string.

       SuppressionOptions -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about the suppression list pref-
          erences for your account.

          SuppressedReasons -> (list)
              A list that contains the reasons that email addresses are  auto-
              matically  added  to the suppression list for your account. This
              list can contain any or all of the following:

              o COMPLAINT  Amazon SES adds an email address to the suppression
                list  for  your  account  when  a message sent to that address
                results in a complaint.

              o BOUNCE  Amazon SES adds an email address  to  the  suppression
                list  for  your  account  when  a message sent to that address
                results in a hard bounce.

              (string)
                 The reason that the address was added to the suppression list
                 for your account. The value can be one of the following:

                 o COMPLAINT   Amazon  SES  added an email address to the sup-
                   pression list for your account because a  message  sent  to
                   that address results in a complaint.

                 o BOUNCE   Amazon  SES added an email address to the suppres-
                   sion list for your account because a message sent  to  that
                   address results in a hard bounce.
