NAME
       put-dedicated-ip-in-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Move a dedicated IP address to an existing dedicated IP pool.

       NOTE:
          The  dedicated  IP  address that you specify must already exist, and
          must be associated with your Amazon Web Services account.

          The dedicated IP pool you specify must already exist. You can create
          a new pool by using the CreateDedicatedIpPool operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-dedicated-ip-in-pool
          --ip <value>
          --destination-pool-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ip (string)
          The  IP  address that you want to move to the dedicated IP pool. The
          value you specify has to be a dedicated IP address that's associated
          with your Amazon Web Services account.

       --destination-pool-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  IP  pool  that  you want to add the dedicated IP
          address to. You have to specify an IP pool that already exists.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
