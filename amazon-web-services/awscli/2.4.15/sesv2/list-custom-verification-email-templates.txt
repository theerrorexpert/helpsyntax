SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-verification-email-templates
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token returned from a previous  call  to  ListCustomVerificationE-
          mailTemplates to indicate the position in the list of custom verifi-
          cation email templates.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of results to show in a single call to  ListCustomVerifi-
          cationEmailTemplates  .  If the number of results is larger than the
          number you specified in this parameter, then the response includes a
          NextToken element, which you can use to obtain additional results.

          The  value you specify has to be at least 1, and can be no more than
          50.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
