NAME
       list-domain-deliverability-campaigns -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve deliverability data for all the campaigns that used a specific
       domain to send email during a specified time range. This data is avail-
       able  for a domain only if you enabled the Deliverability dashboard for
       the domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-domain-deliverability-campaigns
          --start-date <value>
          --end-date <value>
          --subscribed-domain <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-date (timestamp)
          The first day, in Unix time format, that you want to obtain deliver-
          ability data for.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The  last day, in Unix time format, that you want to obtain deliver-
          ability data for. This value has to be less than or equal to 30 days
          after the value of the StartDate parameter.

       --subscribed-domain (string)
          The domain to obtain deliverability data for.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token thats returned from a previous call to the ListDomainDeliv-
          erabilityCampaigns operation. This token indicates the position of a
          campaign in the list of campaigns.

       --page-size (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to include in response to a single
          call to the ListDomainDeliverabilityCampaigns operation. If the num-
          ber  of  results  is larger than the number that you specify in this
          parameter, the response includes a NextToken element, which you  can
          use to obtain additional results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The  last  time,  in Unix time format, when the email message
                 was delivered to any recipient's inbox. This value  can  help
