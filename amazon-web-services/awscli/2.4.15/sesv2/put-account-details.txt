       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --production-access-enabled | --no-production-access-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates  whether or not your account should have production access
          in the current Amazon Web Services Region.

          If the value is false , then your account is in the sandbox  .  When
          your  account is in the sandbox, you can only send email to verified
          identities. Additionally, the maximum number of emails you can  send
          in  a  24-hour  period  (your sending quota) is 200, and the maximum
          number of emails you can send per second (your maximum sending rate)
          is 1.

          If the value is true , then your account has production access. When
          your account has production  access,  you  can  send  email  to  any
          address. The sending quota and maximum sending rate for your account
          vary based on your specific use case.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
