SYNOPSIS
            send-bulk-email
          [--from-email-address <value>]
          [--from-email-address-identity-arn <value>]
          [--reply-to-addresses <value>]
          [--feedback-forwarding-email-address <value>]
          [--feedback-forwarding-email-address-identity-arn <value>]
          [--default-email-tags <value>]
          --default-content <value>
          --bulk-email-entries <value>
          [--configuration-set-name <value>]

OPTIONS
       --from-email-address (string)
          The  email  address  to use as the "From" address for the email. The
          address that you specify has to be verified.

       --from-email-address-identity-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to use the email address  specified  in  the
          FromEmailAddress parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches  a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use sender@example.com, then you
          would    specify    the    FromEmailAddressIdentityArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com,   and   the
          FromEmailAddress to be sender@example.com.

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --reply-to-addresses (list)
          The  "Reply-to"  email addresses for the message. When the recipient
          replies to the message, each Reply-to address receives the reply.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --feedback-forwarding-email-address (string)
          The address that you want bounce and complaint notifications  to  be
          sent to.

       --feedback-forwarding-email-address-identity-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com)  attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use  feedback@example.com,  then
          you  would  specify the FeedbackForwardingEmailAddressIdentityArn to
          be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and  the
          FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress to be feedback@example.com.

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

          email  that  you send using the SendEmail operation. Tags correspond
          to characteristics of the email that you define,  so  that  you  can
          publish email sending events.

          (structure)
              Contains the name and value of a tag that you apply to an email.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the message tag. The message tag name has to meet
                 the following criteria:

                 o It can only contain ASCII letters (az, AZ),  numbers  (09),
                   underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o It can contain no more than 256 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the message tag. The message tag value has to
                 meet the following criteria:

                 o It can only contain ASCII letters (az, AZ),  numbers  (09),
                   underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o It can contain no more than 256 characters.

            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --default-content (structure)
          An  object  that contains the body of the message. You can specify a
          template message.

          Template -> (structure)
              The template to use for the bulk email message.

              TemplateName -> (string)
                 The name of the template. You will refer to  this  name  when
                 you  send  email using the SendTemplatedEmail or SendBulkTem-

              TemplateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the template.

              TemplateData -> (string)
                 An object that defines the values to use  for  message  vari-
                 ables  in  the  template.  This  object is a set of key-value
                 pairs. Each key defines a message variable in  the  template.
                 The  corresponding  value  defines  the value to use for that
                 variable.

                 Represents the destination of the message, consisting of To:,
                 CC:, and BCC: fields.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  SES  does  not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as
                     described in RFC6531 . For this reason, the local part of
                     a  destination  email  address  (the  part  of  the email
                     address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain  7-bit
                     ASCII  characters . If the domain part of an address (the
                     part after the @  sign)  contains  non-ASCII  characters,
                     they  must  be  encoded  using  Punycode, as described in
                     RFC3492 .

                 ToAddresses -> (list)
                     An array that contains the email addresses  of  the  "To"
                     recipients for the email.

                     An  array  that  contains the email addresses of the "CC"
                     (carbon copy) recipients for the email.

                     (string)

                 BccAddresses -> (list)
                     An array that contains the email addresses of  the  "BCC"
                     (blind carbon copy) recipients for the email.

                     (string)

              ReplacementTags -> (list)
                 A  list of tags, in the form of name/value pairs, to apply to
                 an email that you send using the SendBulkTemplatedEmail oper-
                 ation.  Tags  correspond to characteristics of the email that
                 you define, so that you can publish email sending events.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the name and value of a tag that you apply to an
                     email.  You  can  use message tags when you publish email
                     sending events.

                     Name -> (string)

                        to meet the following criteria:

                        o It  can only contain ASCII letters (az, AZ), numbers
                          (09), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                        o It can contain no more than 256 characters.

                     ReplacementTemplateData -> (string)
                        A list of replacement values to apply to the template.
                        This  parameter is a JSON object, typically consisting
                        of key-value pairs in which  the  keys  correspond  to
                        replacement tags in the email template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Destination={ToAddresses=[string,string],CcAddresses=[string,string],BccAddresses=[string,string]},ReplacementTags=[{Name=string,Value=string},{Name=string,Value=string}],ReplacementEmailContent={ReplacementTemplate={ReplacementTemplateData=string}} ...

       JSON Syntax:

                "ReplacementTemplate": {
                  "ReplacementTemplateData": "string"
                }
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set to use when sending the email.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          retry any messages with a failure status.

          (structure)
              The result of the  SendBulkEmail  operation  of  each  specified
              BulkEmailEntry .

              Status -> (string)
