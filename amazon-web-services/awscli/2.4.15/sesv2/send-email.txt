SEND-EMAIL()                                                      SEND-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  an  email message. You can use the Amazon SES API v2 to send the
       following types of messages:

       o Simple  A standard email message. When you create this type  of  mes-
         sage,  you  specify  the sender, the recipient, and the message body,
         and Amazon SES assembles the message for you.

       o Raw  A raw, MIME-formatted email message. When you send this type  of
         email, you have to specify all of the message headers, as well as the
         message body. You can use this message type  to  send  messages  that
         contain  attachments.  The message that you specify has to be a valid
         MIME message.

       o Templated  A message that contains  personalization  tags.  When  you
         send this type of email, Amazon SES API v2 automatically replaces the
         tags with values that you specify.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            send-email
          [--from-email-address <value>]
          [--from-email-address-identity-arn <value>]
          [--destination <value>]
          [--reply-to-addresses <value>]
          [--feedback-forwarding-email-address <value>]
          [--feedback-forwarding-email-address-identity-arn <value>]
          --content <value>
          [--email-tags <value>]
          [--configuration-set-name <value>]
          [--list-management-options <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --from-email-address (string)
          The email address to use as the "From" address for  the  email.  The
          address that you specify has to be verified.

       --from-email-address-identity-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          FromEmailAddress parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com)  attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use sender@example.com, then you
          would     specify     the    FromEmailAddressIdentityArn    to    be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com,   and   the
          FromEmailAddress to be sender@example.com.

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

          For Raw emails, the FromEmailAddressIdentityArn value overrides  the
          X-SES-SOURCE-ARN  and  X-SES-FROM-ARN headers specified in raw email
          message content.

       --destination (structure)
          An object that contains the recipients of the email message.

          ToAddresses -> (list)
              An array that contains the email addresses of the  "To"  recipi-
              ents for the email.

              (string)

          CcAddresses -> (list)
              An  array  that contains the email addresses of the "CC" (carbon
              copy) recipients for the email.

              (string)

          BccAddresses -> (list)
              An array that contains the email addresses of the  "BCC"  (blind
              carbon copy) recipients for the email.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ToAddresses=string,string,CcAddresses=string,string,BccAddresses=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ToAddresses": ["string", ...],
            "CcAddresses": ["string", ...],
            "BccAddresses": ["string", ...]
          }

       --reply-to-addresses (list)
          The  "Reply-to"  email addresses for the message. When the recipient
          replies to the message, each Reply-to address receives the reply.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --feedback-forwarding-email-address (string)
          The address that you want bounce and complaint notifications  to  be
          sent to.

       --feedback-forwarding-email-address-identity-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com)  attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use  feedback@example.com,  then
          you  would  specify the FeedbackForwardingEmailAddressIdentityArn to
          be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and  the
          FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress to be feedback@example.com.

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --content (structure)
          An object that contains the body of the message. You can send either
          a Simple message Raw message or a template Message.

          Simple -> (structure)
              The  simple email message. The message consists of a subject and
              a message body.

              Subject -> (structure)
                 The subject line of the email. The subject line can only con-
                 tain   7-bit  ASCII  characters.  However,  you  can  specify
                 non-ASCII  characters  in   the   subject   line   by   using
                 encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047 .

                 Data -> (string)
                     The content of the message itself.

                 Charset -> (string)
                     The  character  set  for the content. Because of the con-
                     straints of the SMTP  protocol,  Amazon  SES  uses  7-bit
                     ASCII by default. If the text includes characters outside
                     of the ASCII range, you have to specify a character  set.
                     For  example,  you  could specify UTF-8 , ISO-8859-1 , or
                     Shift_JIS .

              Body -> (structure)
                 The body of the message. You can specify an HTML  version  of
                 the message, a text-only version of the message, or both.

                 Text -> (structure)
                     An object that represents the version of the message that
                     is displayed in email clients that don't support HTML, or
                     clients  where the recipient has disabled HTML rendering.

                     Data -> (string)
                        The content of the message itself.

                     Charset -> (string)
                        The character set for the content. Because of the con-
                        straints  of  the SMTP protocol, Amazon SES uses 7-bit
                        ASCII by default. If the text includes characters out-
                        side of the ASCII range, you have to specify a charac-
                        ter set.  For  example,  you  could  specify  UTF-8  ,
                        ISO-8859-1 , or Shift_JIS .

                 Html -> (structure)
                     An object that represents the version of the message that
                     is displayed in email clients  that  support  HTML.  HTML
                     messages  can include formatted text, hyperlinks, images,
                     and more.

                     Data -> (string)
                        The content of the message itself.

                     Charset -> (string)
                        The character set for the content. Because of the con-
                        straints  of  the SMTP protocol, Amazon SES uses 7-bit
                        ASCII by default. If the text includes characters out-
                        side of the ASCII range, you have to specify a charac-
                        ter set.  For  example,  you  could  specify  UTF-8  ,
                        ISO-8859-1 , or Shift_JIS .

          Raw -> (structure)
              The  raw  email  message.  The message has to meet the following
              criteria:

              o The message has to contain a header and a body,  separated  by
                one blank line.

              o All  of the required header fields must be present in the mes-
                sage.

              o Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted  prop-
                erly.

              o If you include attachments, they must be in a file format that
                the Amazon SES API v2 supports.

              o The entire message must be Base64 encoded.

              o If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content  that
                is  outside  of  the  7-bit  ASCII character range, you should
                encode that content to ensure that recipients'  email  clients
                render the message properly.

              o The  length  of  any  single line of text in the message can't
                exceed 1,000 characters. This restriction is  defined  in  RFC
                5321 .

              Data -> (blob)
                 The  raw email message. The message has to meet the following
                 criteria:

                 o The message has to contain a header and a  body,  separated
                   by one blank line.

                 o All  of  the  required header fields must be present in the
                   message.

                 o Each part of a multipart MIME  message  must  be  formatted
                   properly.

                 o Attachments  must  be  in a file format that the Amazon SES
                   supports.

                 o The entire message must be Base64 encoded.

                 o If any of the MIME parts in your  message  contain  content
                   that  is  outside  of  the 7-bit ASCII character range, you
                   should encode that content to ensure that recipients' email
                   clients render the message properly.

                 o The  length of any single line of text in the message can't
                   exceed 1,000 characters. This restriction is defined in RFC
                   5321 .

          Template -> (structure)
              The template to use for the email message.

              TemplateName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the template. You will refer to this name when
                 you send email using the SendTemplatedEmail  or  SendBulkTem-
                 platedEmail operations.

              TemplateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the template.

              TemplateData -> (string)
                 An  object  that  defines the values to use for message vari-
                 ables in the template. This object  is  a  set  of  key-value
                 pairs.  Each  key defines a message variable in the template.
                 The corresponding value defines the value  to  use  for  that
                 variable.

                   underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o It can contain no more than 256 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the message tag. The message tag  value  has  to
                 meet the following criteria:

                 o It  can  only contain ASCII letters (az, AZ), numbers (09),

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set to use when sending the email.

       --list-management-options (structure)
          An object used to specify a list or topic to which an email belongs,
          which will be used when a contact chooses to unsubscribe.

          ContactListName -> (string)
              The name of the contact list.

          TopicName -> (string)
              The name of the topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ContactListName=string,TopicName=string

       JSON Syntax:

            "TopicName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          A  unique identifier for the message that is generated when the mes-
          sage is accepted.

          NOTE:
              It's possible for Amazon SES to accept a message without sending
              it.  This can happen when the message that you're trying to send
              has an attachment contains a virus, or when you send a templated
              email  that  contains invalid personalization content, for exam-
              ple.
