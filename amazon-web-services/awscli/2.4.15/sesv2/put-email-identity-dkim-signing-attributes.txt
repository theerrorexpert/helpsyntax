         Own DKIM (BYODKIM).

       o Update the key length that should be used for Easy DKIM.

       o Change from using no DKIM authentication to using Easy DKIM.

       o Change from using no DKIM authentication to using BYODKIM.

SYNOPSIS
            put-email-identity-dkim-signing-attributes
          --email-identity <value>
          --signing-attributes-origin <value>
          [--signing-attributes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email identity.

       --signing-attributes-origin (string)
          The method to use to configure DKIM for the identity. There are  the
          following possible values:

          o AWS_SES  Configure DKIM for the identity by using Easy DKIM .

          o EXTERNAL   Configure DKIM for the identity by using Bring Your Own
            DKIM (BYODKIM).

          Possible values:

          o AWS_SES

          o EXTERNAL

       --signing-attributes (structure)
          An object that contains information about the private key and selec-
          tor  that  you  want  to  use to configure DKIM for the identity for
          Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM) for the identity, or,  configures  the
          key length to be used for Easy DKIM .

          DomainSigningSelector -> (string)
              [Bring  Your Own DKIM] A string that's used to identify a public
              key in the DNS configuration for a domain.

          DomainSigningPrivateKey -> (string)
              [Bring Your Own DKIM] A private key that's used  to  generate  a
              DKIM signature.

              The  private  key  must use 1024 or 2048-bit RSA encryption, and
              must be encoded using base64 encoding.

          NextSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy DKIM] The key length of the future DKIM  key  pair  to  be
              generated. This can be changed at most once per day.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DomainSigningSelector=string,DomainSigningPrivateKey=string,NextSigningKeyLength=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DomainSigningSelector": "string",
            "DomainSigningPrivateKey": "string",
            "NextSigningKeyLength": "RSA_1024_BIT"|"RSA_2048_BIT"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DkimStatus -> (string)
          The  DKIM  authentication  status of the identity. Amazon SES deter-
          mines the authentication status by searching for specific records in
          the  DNS configuration for your domain. If you used Easy DKIM to set
          up DKIM authentication, Amazon SES tries to find three unique  CNAME
          records in the DNS configuration for your domain.

          If  you provided a public key to perform DKIM authentication, Amazon
          SES tries to find a TXT record that uses the selector that you spec-
          ified.  The  value  of  the  TXT  record must be a public key that's
          paired with the private key that you specified  in  the  process  of
          creating the identity.

          The status can be one of the following:

          o PENDING   The  verification  process was initiated, but Amazon SES
            hasn't yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configuration  for
            the domain.

          o SUCCESS  The verification process completed successfully.

          o FAILED   The  verification  process  failed. This typically occurs
            when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS configu-
            ration of the domain.

          o TEMPORARY_FAILURE  A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from
            determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.

          o NOT_STARTED  The DKIM verification process hasn't  been  initiated
            for the domain.

       DkimTokens -> (list)
          If  you  used  Easy  DKIM  to  configure DKIM authentication for the
          domain, then this object contains a set of unique strings  that  you
          use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS config-
          uration for your domain. When Amazon SES detects  these  records  in
          the  DNS  configuration  for  your  domain,  the DKIM authentication
          process is complete.

          If you configured DKIM authentication for the  domain  by  providing
          your  own  public-private  key  pair,  then this object contains the
          selector that's associated with your public key.

          Regardless of the DKIM authentication method  you  use,  Amazon  SES
          searches for the appropriate records in the DNS configuration of the
          domain for up to 72 hours.
