SYNOPSIS
            list-contacts
          --contact-list-name <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --contact-list-name (string)
          The name of the contact list.

       --filter (structure)
          A filter that can be applied to a list of contacts.

          FilteredStatus -> (string)
              The status by which you are filtering: OPT_IN or OPT_OUT .

          TopicFilter -> (structure)
              Used for filtering by a specific topic preference.

              TopicName -> (string)
                 The name of a topic on which you wish to apply the filter.

              UseDefaultIfPreferenceUnavailable -> (boolean)
                 Notes  that the default subscription status should be applied
                 to a contact because the contact has not noted their  prefer-
                 ence for subscribing to a topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FilteredStatus=string,TopicFilter={TopicName=string,UseDefaultIfPreferenceUnavailable=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FilteredStatus": "OPT_IN"|"OPT_OUT",
            "TopicFilter": {
              "TopicName": "string",
              "UseDefaultIfPreferenceUnavailable": true|false
            }
          }

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of contacts that may be returned at once, which is depen-
          dent on if there are more or less contacts than  the  value  of  the
          PageSize. Use this parameter to paginate results. If additional con-
          tacts exist beyond the specified limit,  the  NextToken  element  is
          sent in the response. Use the NextToken value in subsequent requests
          to retrieve additional contacts.

       --next-token (string)
          A string token indicating that there might  be  additional  contacts
          available  to  be  listed. Use the token provided in the Response to
          use in the subsequent call to ListContacts with the same  parameters
          to retrieve the next page of contacts.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
