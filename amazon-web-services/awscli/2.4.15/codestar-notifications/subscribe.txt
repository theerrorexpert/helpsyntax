SUBSCRIBE()                                                        SUBSCRIBE()



NAME
       subscribe -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an association between a notification rule and an SNS topic so
       that the associated target can receive notifications  when  the  events
       described in the rule are triggered.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            subscribe
          --arn <value>
          --target <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the notification rule for which
          you want to create the association.

       --target (structure)
          Information about the SNS  topics  associated  with  a  notification
          rule.

          TargetType -> (string)
              The target type. Can be an Amazon SNS topic.

          TargetAddress -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TargetType=string,TargetAddress=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TargetType": "string",
            "TargetAddress": "string"
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          An  enumeration  token that, when provided in a request, returns the
          next batch of the results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add a target to a notification rule

       The following subscribe example adds an Amazon SNS topic  as  a  target
       for the specified notification rule.

          aws codestar-notifications subscribe \
              --arn arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE \
              --target TargetType=SNS,TargetAddress=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyNotificationTopic

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see Add or Remove an Amazon SNS Topic as a Target

          you have created assocations.
