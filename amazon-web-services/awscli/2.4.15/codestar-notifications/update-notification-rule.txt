       --detail-type (string)
          The  level  of  detail  to  include  in  the  notifications for this
          resource. BASIC will include only the contents of the  event  as  it

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a notification rule

       The  following  update-notification-rule example updates a notification
       rule named MyNotificationRule in the AWS account 123456789012  using  a
       JSON file named update.json.

          aws codestar-notifications update-notification-rule \
              --cli-input-json file://update.json

       Contents of update.json:

          {
              "Name": "MyUpdatedNotificationRule",
              "EventTypeIds": [
                  "codecommit-repository-branches-and-tags-created"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-1:123456789012:MyDemoRepo",
              "Targets": [
                  {
                      "TargetType": "SNS",
                      "TargetAddress": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyNotificationTopic"

              "DetailType": "FULL"
          }
