LIST-NOTIFICATION-RULES()                            LIST-NOTIFICATION-RULES()



NAME
       list-notification-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the notification rules for an AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-notification-rules  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: NotificationRules

SYNOPSIS
            list-notification-rules
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters to use to return  information  by  service  or  resource
          type. For valid values, see  ListNotificationRulesFilter .

          NOTE:
              A  filter with the same name can appear more than once when used
              with OR statements.  Filters  with  different  names  should  be
              applied with AND statements.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a  filter  to  apply to the list of returned
              notification  rules.  You  can  filter  by  event  type,  owner,
              resource, or target.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  attribute  you  want to use to filter the
                 returned notification rules.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute you want  to  use  to  filter  the
                 returned notification rules. For example, if you specify fil-
                 tering by RESOURCE in Name, you might specify the  ARN  of  a
                 pipeline in AWS CodePipeline for the value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "EVENT_TYPE_ID"|"CREATED_BY"|"RESOURCE"|"TARGET_ADDRESS",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of notification rules

       The following list-notification-rules example retrieves a list  of  all
       notification rules in the specified AWS Region.

          aws codestar-notifications list-notification-rules --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "NotificationRules": [
                  {
                      "Id": "dc82df7a-EXAMPLE",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE"
                  },
                  {
                      "Id": "8d1f0983-EXAMPLE",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/8d1f0983-EXAMPLE"
                  }
              ]
          }

              Arn -> (string)
