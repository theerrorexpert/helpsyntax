DELETE-TARGET()                                                DELETE-TARGET()



NAME
       delete-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a specified target for notifications.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-target
          --target-address <value>
          [--force-unsubscribe-all | --no-force-unsubscribe-all]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-address (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic to delete.

       --force-unsubscribe-all | --no-force-unsubscribe-all (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value  that  can be used to delete all associations with
          this SNS topic. The default value is FALSE.  If  set  to  TRUE,  all
          associations between that target and every notification rule in your
          AWS account are deleted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a notification rule target

       The following delete-target example removes the specified  target  from
       all  notification  rules  configured  to  use  it as a target, and then
       deletes the target.

          aws codestar-notifications  delete-target \
              --target-address arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyNotificationTopic \
              --force-unsubscribe-all

       This command produces no output.

       Developer Tools Console User Guide.
