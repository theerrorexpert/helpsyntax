OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name for the notification rule. Notifictaion rule names must be
          unique in your AWS account.

       --event-type-ids (list)
          A list of event types associated with this notification rule. For  a
          list of allowed events, see  EventTypeSummary .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to associate with the
          notification rule. Supported  resources  include  pipelines  in  AWS
          CodePipeline,  repositories in AWS CodeCommit, and build projects in
          AWS CodeBuild.

       --targets (list)
          A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of SNS  topics  to  associate
          with the notification rule.

          (structure)
              Information  about the SNS topics associated with a notification
              rule.

              TargetType -> (string)
                 The target type. Can be an Amazon SNS topic.

              TargetAddress -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TargetType=string,TargetAddress=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TargetType": "string",
              "TargetAddress": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --detail-type (string)
          The level of  detail  to  include  in  the  notifications  for  this
          resource.  BASIC  will  include only the contents of the event as it
          would appear in AWS CloudWatch. FULL will include  any  supplemental
          information  provided  by AWS CodeStar Notifications and/or the ser-
          vice for the resource for which the notification is created.

          Possible values:

          o BASIC

          o FULL

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided  in
          a  request,  ensures  the  request cannot be repeated with a changed
          parameter. If a request with the same parameters is received  and  a
          token is included, the request returns information about the initial
          request that used that token.

          NOTE:
              The AWS SDKs prepopulate client request tokens. If you are using
              an AWS SDK, an idempotency token is created for you.

       --tags (map)
          A  list of tags to apply to this notification rule. Key names cannot
          start with "aws".

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --status (string)
          The status of the notification rule. The default value  is  ENABLED.
          If  the status is set to DISABLED, notifications aren't sent for the
          notification rule.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a notification rule

       The following create-notification-rule example uses a JSON  file  named
       rule.json  to create a notification rule named MyNotificationRule for a
       repository named MyDemoRepo in the specified  AWS  acccount.  Notifica-
       tions with the FULL detail type are sent to the specified target Amazon
       SNS topic when branches and tags are created.

          aws codestar-notifications create-notification-rule \
              --cli-input-json file://rule.json

       Contents of rule.json:

          {
              "Name": "MyNotificationRule",
              "EventTypeIds": [
                  "codecommit-repository-branches-and-tags-created"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-1:123456789012:MyDemoRepo",
              "Targets": [
                  {
                      "TargetType": "SNS",
                      "TargetAddress": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyNotificationTopic"
                  }
              ],
              "Status": "ENABLED",
              "DetailType": "FULL"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE"
          }

       oper Tools Console User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notification rule.
