DISCOVERY()                                                        DISCOVERY()



NAME
       discovery -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration
       projects. It automatically identifies servers, virtual machines  (VMs),
       and  network  dependencies  in  your on-premises data centers. For more
       information, see the AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ  .  Applica-
       tion  Discovery  Service  offers three ways of performing discovery and
       collecting data about your on-premises servers:

       o Agentless discovery is recommended for environments that  use  VMware
         vCenter  Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on
         each host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.

         o Agentless discovery gathers server information  regardless  of  the
           operating  systems,  which  minimizes the time required for initial
           on-premises infrastructure assessment.

         o Agentless  discovery  doesn't  collect  information  about  network
           dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information.

       o Agent-based discovery collects a richer set of  data  than  agentless
         discovery  by  using  the  AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you
         install on one or more hosts in your data center.

         o The agent  captures  infrastructure  and  application  information,
           including  an  inventory  of  running processes, system performance
           information, resource utilization, and network dependencies.

         o The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in tran-
           sit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.

       o AWS  Partner  Network (APN) solutions integrate with Application Dis-
         covery Service, enabling you to import details  of  your  on-premises
         environment  directly  into Migration Hub without using the discovery
         connector or discovery agent.

         o Third-party application discovery tools can query  AWS  Application
           Discovery  Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery
           Service database using the public API.

         o In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so
           that  you  can associate applications with servers and track migra-
           tions.
          Recommendations

       We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environ-
       ments,  and  whenever  you  want  to  collect information about network
       dependencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery  simulta-
       neously. Use agentless discovery to complete the initial infrastructure
       assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to  collect
       additional information.
          Working With This Guide

       This  API  reference  provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples
       for each of the actions and data types for Application  Discovery  Ser-
       vice.  The  topic  for each action shows the API request parameters and
       the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to  access
       an  API  that  is tailored to the programming language or platform that
       you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs .

       NOTE:

          o Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home  region  before
            you call any of these APIs.

          o You  must  make API calls for write actions (create, notify, asso-
            ciate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or
            a HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned.

          o API  calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are
            permitted outside of your home region.

          o Although it is unlikely,  the  Migration  Hub  home  region  could
            change.  If you call APIs outside the home region, an InvalidInpu-
            tException is returned.

          o You must call GetHomeRegion to obtain  the  latest  Migration  Hub
            home region.
