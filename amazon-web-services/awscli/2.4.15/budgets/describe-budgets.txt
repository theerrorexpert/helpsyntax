NAME
       describe-budgets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the budgets that are associated with an account.

       WARNING:
          The  Request  Syntax  section  shows  the  BudgetLimit  syntax.  For
          PlannedBudgetLimits , see the Examples section.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-budgets is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Budgets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-budgets
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  accountId  that  is  associated  with the budgets that you want
          descriptions of.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Budgets -> (list)
          A list of budgets.

          (structure)
              Represents the output of the CreateBudget operation. The content
              consists of the detailed metadata and data file information, and
              the current status of the budget object.

              This is the ARN pattern for a budget:
                 arn:aws:budgets::AccountId:budget/budgetName

              BudgetName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  a  budget.  The  name must be unique within an
                 account. The : and \ characters aren't allowed in  BudgetName
                 .

              BudgetLimit -> (structure)
                 The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage,
                 Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you
                 want to track with your budget.
                     BudgetLimit  is  required  for cost or usage budgets, but
                     optional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or  coverage
                     budgets.  RI  and  Savings  Plans utilization or coverage
                     budgets default to 100 , which is the  only  valid  value
                     for  RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets.
                     You can't use BudgetLimit  with  PlannedBudgetLimits  for
                     CreateBudget and UpdateBudget actions.

                 Amount -> (string)
                     The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget
                     forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                 Unit -> (string)
                     The unit of measurement that is used for the budget fore-
                     cast,  actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars
                     or GB.

              PlannedBudgetLimits -> (map)
                 A map containing multiple BudgetLimit , including current  or
                 future limits.
                     PlannedBudgetLimits is available for cost or usage budget
                     and supports monthly and quarterly TimeUnit .

                 For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of PlannedBudgetLimits
                 values.  This  must  start from the current month and include
                 the next 11 months. The key is the start of the month, UTC in
                 epoch seconds.

                 For  quarterly  budgets,  provide  4  quarters of PlannedBud-
                 getLimits value entries in standard calendar  quarter  incre-
                 ments.  This  must start from the current quarter and include
                 the next 3 quarters. The key is the start of the quarter, UTC
                 in epoch seconds.

                 If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or
                 4 quarters for  quarterly,  provide  the  PlannedBudgetLimits
                 values only for the remaining periods.

                 If  the  budget  begins  at  a  date  in  the future, provide
                 PlannedBudgetLimits values from the start date of the budget.

                 After  all  of  the BudgetLimit values in PlannedBudgetLimits
                 are used, the budget continues to use the last limit  as  the
                 BudgetLimit  . At that point, the planned budget provides the
                 same experience as a fixed budget.
                     DescribeBudget and DescribeBudgets  response  along  with
                     PlannedBudgetLimits  will also contain BudgetLimit repre-
                     senting the current month or  quarter  limit  present  in
                     PlannedBudgetLimits  .  This only applies to budgets cre-
                     ated with PlannedBudgetLimits . Budgets  created  without
                     PlannedBudgetLimits  will  only contain BudgetLimit , and
                     no PlannedBudgetLimits .

                 key -> (string)
                     A generic string.

                 value -> (structure)
                     The amount of cost or usage that is measured for  a  bud-
                     get.

                     For  example, a Spend for 3 GB of S3 usage would have the
                     following parameters:

                     o An Amount of 3

                     o A unit of GB

                     Amount -> (string)
                        The cost or usage amount that  is  associated  with  a
                        budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The  unit  of  measurement that is used for the budget
                        forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold,  such  as
                        dollars or GB.

              CostFilters -> (map)
                 The cost filters, such as service or tag, that are applied to
                 a budget.

                 AWS Budgets supports the following services as a  filter  for
                 RI budgets:

                 o Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute

                 o Amazon Redshift

                 o Amazon Relational Database Service

                 o Amazon ElastiCache

                 o Amazon Elasticsearch Service

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)
                        A generic string.

              CostTypes -> (structure)
                 The types of costs that are included in this COST budget.
                     USAGE , RI_UTILIZATION , RI_COVERAGE , SAVINGS_PLANS_UTI-
                     LIZATION , and SAVINGS_PLANS_COVERAGE budgets do not have
                     CostTypes .

                 IncludeTax -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether a budget includes taxes.

                     The default value is true .

                 IncludeRecurring -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  a budget includes recurring fees such
                     as monthly RI fees.

                     The default value is true .

                 IncludeOtherSubscription -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether a budget includes  non-RI  subscription
                     costs.

                     The default value is true .

              TimePeriod -> (structure)
                 The  period  of  time that is covered by a budget. The period
                 has a start date and an end date. The start  date  must  come
                 before  the  end date. The end date must come before 06/15/87
                 00:00 UTC .

                 If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS
                 defaults  to  the  start  of  your chosen time period (DAILY,
                 MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created
                 your budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY , and didn't set
                 a start date, AWS set your start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC .
                 If  you  chose  MONTHLY , AWS set your start date to 01/01/18
                 00:00 UTC . If you didn't specify an end date, AWS  set  your
                 end  date  to  06/15/87 00:00 UTC . The defaults are the same
                 for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the  API.

                 You can change either date with the UpdateBudget operation.

                 After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated
                 notifications and subscribers.

                 Start -> (timestamp)
                     The start date for a budget. If you created  your  budget
                     and  didn't  specify  a  start  date, AWS defaults to the
                     start of your chosen time period (DAILY,  MONTHLY,  QUAR-
                     TERLY,  or  ANNUALLY).  For  example, if you created your
                     budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY , and didn't  set
                     a  start  date, AWS set your start date to 01/24/18 00:00
                     UTC . If you chose MONTHLY , AWS set your start  date  to
                     01/01/18  00:00  UTC  . The defaults are the same for the
                     AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                     You can change your  start  date  with  the  UpdateBudget
                     operation.

                 End -> (timestamp)
                     The  end  date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end
                     date, AWS set your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC  .  The
                     defaults  are  the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Man-
                     agement console and the API.

                     After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all  asso-
                     ciated notifications and subscribers. You can change your
                     end date with the UpdateBudget operation.

              CalculatedSpend -> (structure)
                 The actual and forecasted  cost  or  usage  that  the  budget
                 tracks.

                 ActualSpend -> (structure)
                     The  amount  of  cost,  usage, RI units, or Savings Plans
