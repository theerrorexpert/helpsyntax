NAME
       describe-budget-action-histories -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a budget action history detail.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-budget-action-histories is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ActionHistories

SYNOPSIS
            describe-budget-action-histories
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          --action-id <value>
          [--time-period <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the user. It should be a 12-digit number.

       --budget-name (string)
          A string that represents the budget name. The ":" and ""  characters
          aren't allowed.

       --action-id (string)
          A  system-generated  universally  unique  identifier  (UUID) for the
          action.

       --time-period (structure)
          The period of time that is covered by a budget.  The  period  has  a
          start  date and an end date. The start date must come before the end
          date. There are no restrictions on the end date.

          Start -> (timestamp)
              The start date for a budget. If  you  created  your  budget  and
              didn't  specify  a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your
              chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For
              example,  if  you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose
              DAILY , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date  to
              01/24/18  00:00  UTC . If you chose MONTHLY , AWS set your start
              date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC . The defaults are the same  for  the
              AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

              You  can change your start date with the UpdateBudget operation.

          End -> (timestamp)
              The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify  an  end  date,
              AWS  set  your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC . The defaults are
              the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the
              API.

              After  the  end  date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated
              notifications and subscribers. You can change your end date with
              the UpdateBudget operation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=timestamp,End=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": timestamp,
            "End": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
