       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-notification
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          --old-notification <value>
          --new-notification <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  accountId that is associated with the budget whose notification
          you want to update.

       --budget-name (string)
          The name of the budget whose notification you want to update.

       --old-notification (structure)
          The previous notification that is associated with a budget.

          NotificationType -> (string)
              Whether the notification is for how much you have spent  (ACTUAL
              ) or for how much you're forecasted to spend (FORECASTED ).

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The comparison that is used for this notification.

          Threshold -> (double)
              The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds
              are always a percentage, and many  customers  find  value  being
              alerted  between  50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum
              limit for  your  threshold  is  1,000,000%  above  the  budgeted
              amount.

          ThresholdType -> (string)
              The  type  of  threshold  for a notification. For ABSOLUTE_VALUE
              thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are  forecasted
              to go over your total cost threshold. For PERCENTAGE thresholds,
              AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a
              certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you
              have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a PERCENTAGE  thresh-
              old of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          NotificationState -> (string)
              Whether  this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification
              is in the ALARM state, you have passed the set threshold for the
              budget.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationType=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Threshold=double,ThresholdType=string,NotificationState=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL"|"FORECASTED",
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"EQUAL_TO",
            "Threshold": double,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"|"ABSOLUTE_VALUE",
            "NotificationState": "OK"|"ALARM"
          }

       --new-notification (structure)
          The updated notification to be associated with a budget.

          NotificationType -> (string)
              Whether  the notification is for how much you have spent (ACTUAL
              ) or for how much you're forecasted to spend (FORECASTED ).

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The comparison that is used for this notification.

          Threshold -> (double)
              The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds
              are  always  a  percentage,  and many customers find value being
              alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount.  The  maximum
              limit  for  your  threshold  is  1,000,000%  above  the budgeted
              amount.

          ThresholdType -> (string)
              The type of threshold for  a  notification.  For  ABSOLUTE_VALUE
              thresholds,  AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted
              to go over your total cost threshold. For PERCENTAGE thresholds,
              AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a
              certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you
              have  a budget for 200 dollars and you have a PERCENTAGE thresh-
              old of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          NotificationState -> (string)
              Whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget  notification
              is in the ALARM state, you have passed the set threshold for the
              budget.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationType=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Threshold=double,ThresholdType=string,NotificationState=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL"|"FORECASTED",
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"EQUAL_TO",
            "Threshold": double,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"|"ABSOLUTE_VALUE",
            "NotificationState": "OK"|"ALARM"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To replace a notification for a Cost and Usage budget

       This example replaces an 80% notification for a Cost and  Usage  budget
       with a 90% notification.

       Command:

          aws budgets update-notification --account-id 111122223333 --budget-name "Example Budget" --old-notification  NotificationType=ACTUAL,ComparisonOperator=GREATER_THAN,Threshold=80,ThresholdType=PERCENTAGE --new-notification  NotificationType=ACTUAL,ComparisonOperator=GREATER_THAN,Threshold=90,ThresholdType=PERCENTAGE

OUTPUT
       None
