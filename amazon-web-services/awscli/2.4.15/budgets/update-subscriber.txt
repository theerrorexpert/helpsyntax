       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-subscriber
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          --notification <value>
          --old-subscriber <value>
          --new-subscriber <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  accountId  that  is associated with the budget whose subscriber
          you want to update.

       --budget-name (string)
          The name of the budget whose subscriber you want to update.

       --notification (structure)
          The notification whose subscriber you want to update.

          NotificationType -> (string)
              Whether the notification is for how much you have spent  (ACTUAL
              ) or for how much you're forecasted to spend (FORECASTED ).

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The comparison that is used for this notification.

          Threshold -> (double)
              The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds
              are always a percentage, and many  customers  find  value  being
              alerted  between  50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum
              limit for  your  threshold  is  1,000,000%  above  the  budgeted
              amount.

          ThresholdType -> (string)
              The  type  of  threshold  for a notification. For ABSOLUTE_VALUE
              thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are  forecasted
              to go over your total cost threshold. For PERCENTAGE thresholds,
              AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a
              certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you
              have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a PERCENTAGE  thresh-
              old of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          NotificationState -> (string)
              Whether  this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification
              is in the ALARM state, you have passed the set threshold for the
              budget.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationType=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Threshold=double,ThresholdType=string,NotificationState=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL"|"FORECASTED",
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"EQUAL_TO",
            "Threshold": double,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"|"ABSOLUTE_VALUE",
            "NotificationState": "OK"|"ALARM"
          }

       --old-subscriber (structure)
          The  previous  subscriber that is associated with a budget notifica-
          tion.

          SubscriptionType -> (string)
              The type of notification that AWS sends to a subscriber.

          Address -> (string)
              The address that AWS sends budget notifications  to,  either  an
              SNS topic or an email.

              When you create a subscriber, the value of Address can't contain
              line breaks.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubscriptionType=string,Address=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubscriptionType": "SNS"|"EMAIL",
            "Address": "string"
          }

       --new-subscriber (structure)
          The updated subscriber that is associated with  a  budget  notifica-
          tion.

          SubscriptionType -> (string)
              The type of notification that AWS sends to a subscriber.

          Address -> (string)
              The  address  that  AWS sends budget notifications to, either an
              SNS topic or an email.

              When you create a subscriber, the value of Address can't contain
              line breaks.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubscriptionType=string,Address=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubscriptionType": "SNS"|"EMAIL",
            "Address": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
