NAME
       describe-budget-performance-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the history for DAILY , MONTHLY , and QUARTERLY budgets. Bud-
       get history isn't available for ANNUAL budgets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-budget-performance-history is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: BudgetPerformanceHistory

SYNOPSIS
            describe-budget-performance-history
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          [--time-period <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the user. It should be a 12-digit number.

       --budget-name (string)
          A  string that represents the budget name. The ":" and "" characters
          aren't allowed.

       --time-period (structure)
          Retrieves how often the budget went into  an  ALARM  state  for  the
          specified time period.

          Start -> (timestamp)
              The  start  date  for  a  budget. If you created your budget and
              didn't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start  of  your
              chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For
              example, if you created your budget on January 24,  2018,  chose
              DAILY  , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to
              01/24/18 00:00 UTC . If you chose MONTHLY , AWS set  your  start
              date  to  01/01/18 00:00 UTC . The defaults are the same for the
              AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

              You can change your start date with the UpdateBudget  operation.

          End -> (timestamp)
              The  end  date  for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date,
              AWS set your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC . The  defaults  are
              the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the
              API.

              After the end date, AWS deletes the budget  and  all  associated
              notifications and subscribers. You can change your end date with
              the UpdateBudget operation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=timestamp,End=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": timestamp,
            "End": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
