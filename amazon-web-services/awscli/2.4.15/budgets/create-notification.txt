NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  notification.  You must create the budget before you create
       the associated notification.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-notification
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          --notification <value>
          --subscribers <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The accountId that is associated with the budget that  you  want  to
          create a notification for.

       --budget-name (string)
          The name of the budget that you want AWS to notify you about. Budget
          names must be unique within an account.

       --notification (structure)
          The notification that you want to create.

          NotificationType -> (string)
              Whether the notification is for how much you have spent  (ACTUAL
              ) or for how much you're forecasted to spend (FORECASTED ).

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The comparison that is used for this notification.

          Threshold -> (double)
              The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds
              are always a percentage, and many  customers  find  value  being
              alerted  between  50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum
              limit for  your  threshold  is  1,000,000%  above  the  budgeted
              amount.

          ThresholdType -> (string)
              The  type  of  threshold  for a notification. For ABSOLUTE_VALUE
              thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are  forecasted
              to go over your total cost threshold. For PERCENTAGE thresholds,
              AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a
              certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you
              have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a PERCENTAGE  thresh-
              old of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          NotificationState -> (string)
              Whether  this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification
              is in the ALARM state, you have passed the set threshold for the
              budget.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationType=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Threshold=double,ThresholdType=string,NotificationState=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL"|"FORECASTED",
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"EQUAL_TO",
            "Threshold": double,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"|"ABSOLUTE_VALUE",
            "NotificationState": "OK"|"ALARM"
          }

       --subscribers (list)
          A  list of subscribers that you want to associate with the notifica-
          tion. Each notification can have one SNS subscriber  and  up  to  10
          email subscribers.

          (structure)
              The subscriber to a budget notification. The subscriber consists
              of a subscription type and either an  Amazon  SNS  topic  or  an
              email address.

              For example, an email subscriber would have the following param-
              eters:

              o A subscriptionType of EMAIL

              o An address of example@example.com

              SubscriptionType -> (string)
                 The type of notification that AWS sends to a subscriber.

              Address -> (string)
                 The address that AWS sends budget notifications to, either an
                 SNS topic or an email.

                 When you create a subscriber, the value of Address can't con-
                 tain line breaks.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubscriptionType=string,Address=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SubscriptionType": "SNS"|"EMAIL",
              "Address": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
