NAME
       describe-subscribers-for-notification -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the subscribers that are associated with a notification.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-subscribers-for-notification  is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Subscribers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-subscribers-for-notification
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          --notification <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The accountId that is associated with the budget  whose  subscribers
          you want descriptions of.

       --budget-name (string)
          The name of the budget whose subscribers you want descriptions of.

       --notification (structure)
          The notification whose subscribers you want to list.

          NotificationType -> (string)
              Whether  the notification is for how much you have spent (ACTUAL
              ) or for how much you're forecasted to spend (FORECASTED ).

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The comparison that is used for this notification.

          Threshold -> (double)
              The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds
              are  always  a  percentage,  and many customers find value being
              alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount.  The  maximum
              limit  for  your  threshold  is  1,000,000%  above  the budgeted
              amount.

          ThresholdType -> (string)
              The type of threshold for  a  notification.  For  ABSOLUTE_VALUE
              thresholds,  AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted
              to go over your total cost threshold. For PERCENTAGE thresholds,
              AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a
              certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you
              have  a budget for 200 dollars and you have a PERCENTAGE thresh-
              old of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          NotificationState -> (string)
              Whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget  notification
              is in the ALARM state, you have passed the set threshold for the
              budget.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationType=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Threshold=double,ThresholdType=string,NotificationState=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL"|"FORECASTED",
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"EQUAL_TO",
            "Threshold": double,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"|"ABSOLUTE_VALUE",
            "NotificationState": "OK"|"ALARM"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the subscribers for a budget notification

       This  example  retrieves  the  subscribers  for a Cost and Usage budget
       notification.

       Command:

          aws budgets describe-subscribers-for-notification --account-id 111122223333 --budget-name "Example Budget" --notification NotificationType=ACTUAL,ComparisonOperator=GREATER_THAN,Threshold=80,ThresholdType=PERCENTAGE --max-results 5

       Output:

          {
             "Subscribers": [
                 {
                     "SubscriptionType": "EMAIL",
                     "Address": "example2@example.com"
                 },
                 {
                     "SubscriptionType": "EMAIL",
                     "Address": "example@example.com"
                 }
             ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Subscribers -> (list)
          A list of subscribers that are associated with a notification.

          (structure)
              The subscriber to a budget notification. The subscriber consists
              of  a  subscription  type  and  either an Amazon SNS topic or an
              email address.

              For example, an email subscriber would have the following param-
              eters:

              o A subscriptionType of EMAIL

              o An address of example@example.com

              SubscriptionType -> (string)
                 The type of notification that AWS sends to a subscriber.

              Address -> (string)
                 The address that AWS sends budget notifications to, either an
                 SNS topic or an email.

                 When you create a subscriber, the value of Address can't con-
                 tain line breaks.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token in the service response that indicates the next
          set of results that you can retrieve.
