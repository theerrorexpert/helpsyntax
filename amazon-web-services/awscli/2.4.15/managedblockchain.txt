NAME
       managedblockchain -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Managed  Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and
       managing blockchain networks using open-source  frameworks.  Blockchain
       allows  you  to  build applications where multiple parties can securely
       and transparently run transactions and share data without the need  for
       a trusted, central authority.

       Managed   Blockchain  supports  the  Hyperledger  Fabric  and  Ethereum
       open-source frameworks. Because of fundamental differences between  the
       frameworks,  some  API actions or data types may only apply in the con-
       text of one framework and not the other. For example,  actions  related
       to  Hyperledger Fabric network members such as CreateMember and Delete-
       Member do not apply to Ethereum.

       The description for each action indicates the framework  or  frameworks
       to  which  it applies. Data types and properties that apply only in the
       context of a particular framework are similarly indicated.
