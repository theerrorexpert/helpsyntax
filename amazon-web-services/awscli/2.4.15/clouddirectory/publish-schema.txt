SYNOPSIS
            publish-schema
          --development-schema-arn <value>
          [--minor-version <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          --schema-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --development-schema-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the  develop-
          ment schema. For more information, see  arns .

       --minor-version (string)
          The  minor  version  under  which the schema will be published. This
          parameter is recommended. Schemas have both a major and  minor  ver-
          sion associated with them.

       --name (string)
          The  new  name  under which the schema will be published. If this is
          not provided, the development schema is considered.

       --schema-version (string)
          The major version under which the schema will be published.  Schemas
          have both a major and minor version associated with them.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PublishedSchemaArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  that  is  associated  with  the published schema. For more
          information, see  arns .
