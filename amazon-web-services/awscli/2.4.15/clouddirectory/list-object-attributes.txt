LIST-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTES()                              LIST-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       list-object-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all attributes that are associated with an object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-object-attributes is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Attributes

SYNOPSIS
            list-object-attributes
          --directory-arn <value>
          --object-reference <value>
          [--consistency-level <value>]
          [--facet-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with  the   Direc-
          tory where the object resides. For more information, see  arns .

       --object-reference (structure)
          The  reference  that  identifies the object whose attributes will be
          listed.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child  links  leading to it from the directory root. Use the
              link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the  path.
              Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names are sepa-
              rated by slashes. For more information about paths,  see  Access
              Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an  opaque  string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the  identifier  of  the  created
                object.  An objects identifier is immutable and no two objects
                will ever share the same object  identifier.  To  identify  an
                object  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier must be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --consistency-level (string)
          Represents the manner and timing in which the  successful  write  or
          update  of  an object is reflected in a subsequent read operation of
          that same object.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --facet-filter (structure)
          Used to filter the list of object  attributes  that  are  associated
          with a certain facet.

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the schema that contains the facet with no minor com-
              ponent. See  arns and In-Place Schema Upgrade for a  description
              of  when  to  provide  minor  versions.  If  this  value is set,
              FacetName must also be set.

          FacetName -> (string)
              The name of the facet. If this value is set, SchemaArn must also
              be set.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,FacetName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "FacetName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
