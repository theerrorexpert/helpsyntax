CREATE-OBJECT()                                                CREATE-OBJECT()



NAME
       create-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an object in a  Directory . Additionally attaches the object to
       a parent, if a parent reference and LinkName is specified. An object is
       simply  a  collection  of   Facet attributes. You can also use this API
       call to create a policy object, if the facet from which you create  the
       object is a policy facet.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-object
          --directory-arn <value>
          --schema-facets <value>
          [--object-attribute-list <value>]
          [--parent-reference <value>]
          [--link-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the  Direc-
          tory in which the object will be created. For more information,  see
          arns .

       --schema-facets (list)
          A  list  of  schema  facets to be associated with the object. Do not
          provide minor version components. See  SchemaFacet for details.

          (structure)
              A facet.

              SchemaArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the schema that contains the facet with  no  minor
                 component.  See   arns  and  In-Place  Schema  Upgrade  for a
                 description of when to provide minor versions. If this  value
                 is set, FacetName must also be set.

              FacetName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the facet. If this value is set, SchemaArn must
                 also be set.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,FacetName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

            }
            ...
          ]

       --object-attribute-list (list)

                 StringValue -> (string)
                     A string data value.

                 BinaryValue -> (blob)
                     A binary data value.

                 BooleanValue -> (boolean)

                 DatetimeValue -> (timestamp)
                     A date and time value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key={SchemaArn=string,FacetName=string,Name=string},Value={StringValue=string,BinaryValue=blob,BooleanValue=boolean,NumberValue=string,DatetimeValue=timestamp} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": {
                "SchemaArn": "string",
                "FacetName": "string",
                "Name": "string"
              },
              "Value": {
                "StringValue": "string",
                "BinaryValue": blob,
                "BooleanValue": true|false,
                "NumberValue": "string",

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --parent-reference (structure)
          If specified, the parent reference to  which  this  object  will  be
          attached.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the
              link  names  from  each parent/child link to construct the path.
              Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are  sepa-
              rated  by  slashes. For more information about paths, see Access
              Objects . You can identify an object in  one  of  the  following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system  will  provide  you  with the identifier of the created
                object. An objects identifier is immutable and no two  objects
                will  ever  share  the  same object identifier. To identify an
                object with ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --link-name (string)
          The name of link that is used to attach this object to a parent.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
          The identifier that is associated with the object.
