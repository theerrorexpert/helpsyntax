LIST-OUTGOING-TYPED-LINKS()                        LIST-OUTGOING-TYPED-LINKS()



NAME
       list-outgoing-typed-links -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a paginated list of all the outgoing  TypedLinkSpecifier infor-
       mation for an object. It also supports filtering by  typed  link  facet
       and identity attributes. For more information, see Typed Links .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-outgoing-typed-links  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: TypedLinkSpecifiers

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the directory where  you  want  to
          list the typed links.

       --object-reference (structure)
          A  reference  that  identifies  the  object whose attributes will be
          listed.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child  links  leading to it from the directory root. Use the
              link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the  path.
              Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names are sepa-
              rated by slashes. For more information about paths,  see  Access
              Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an  opaque  string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the  identifier  of  the  created
                object.  An objects identifier is immutable and no two objects
                will ever share the same object  identifier.  To  identify  an
                object  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier must be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       --filter-attribute-ranges (list)
          Provides range  filters  for  multiple  attributes.  When  providing
          ranges to typed link selection, any inexact ranges must be specified
          at the end. Any attributes that do not have a  range  specified  are
          presumed to match the entire range.

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filter-typed-link (structure)
          Filters are interpreted in the order of the  attributes  defined  on
          the  typed  link  facet,  not the order they are supplied to any API
          calls.

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  that  is  associated  with  the
              schema. For more information, see  arns .

          TypedLinkName -> (string)
              The unique name of the typed link facet.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,TypedLinkName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "TypedLinkName": "string"
          }

       --consistency-level (string)
          The consistency level to execute the request at.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TypedLinkSpecifiers -> (list)
          Returns a typed link specifier as output.

          (structure)
              Contains all the information that is used to uniquely identify a
              typed  link.  The parameters discussed in this topic are used to
              uniquely  specify  the  typed  link  being  operated   on.   The
              AttachTypedLink  API  returns  a  typed link specifier while the
              DetachTypedLink  API  accepts  one  as  input.  Similarly,   the
              ListIncomingTypedLinks  and   ListOutgoingTypedLinks  API opera-
              tions provide typed link specifiers as output. You can also con-
              struct a typed link specifier from scratch.

              TypedLinkFacet -> (structure)
                 Identifies  the  typed link facet that is associated with the
                 typed link.

                 SchemaArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  is  associated  with
                     the schema. For more information, see  arns .

                 TypedLinkName -> (string)
                     The unique name of the typed link facet.

              SourceObjectReference -> (structure)
                 Identifies  the source object that the typed link will attach
                 to.

                 Selector -> (string)
                     A path selector supports easy selection of an  object  by
                     the  parent/child  links leading to it from the directory
                     root. Use the link names from each parent/child  link  to
                     construct the path. Path selectors start with a slash (/)
                     and link names are separated by slashes. For more  infor-
                     mation about paths, see Access Objects . You can identify
                     an object in one of the following ways:

                     o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is  an  opaque
                       string  provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creat-
                       ing objects, the system will provide you with the iden-
                       tifier  of the created object. An objects identifier is
                       immutable and no two objects will ever share  the  same
                       object  identifier. To identify an object with ObjectI-
                       dentifier, the ObjectIdentifier must be wrapped in dou-
                       ble quotes.

                     o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

                     o #SomeBatchReference  - Identifies the object in a batch
                       call

              TargetObjectReference -> (structure)
                 Identifies the target object that the typed link will  attach
                 to.

                 Selector -> (string)
                     A  path  selector supports easy selection of an object by
                     the parent/child links leading to it from  the  directory
                     root.  Use  the link names from each parent/child link to
                     construct the path. Path selectors start with a slash (/)
                     and  link names are separated by slashes. For more infor-

                     o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a  batch
                       call

              IdentityAttributeValues -> (list)
                 Identifies the attribute value to update.

                 (structure)
