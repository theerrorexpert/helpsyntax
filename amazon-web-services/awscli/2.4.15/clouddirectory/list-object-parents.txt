SYNOPSIS
            list-object-parents
          --directory-arn <value>
          --object-reference <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--consistency-level <value>]
          [--include-all-links-to-each-parent | --no-include-all-links-to-each-parent]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with  the   Direc-
          tory where the object resides. For more information, see  arns .

       --object-reference (structure)
          The  reference  that  identifies the object for which parent objects
          are being listed.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child  links  leading to it from the directory root. Use the
              link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the  path.
              Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names are sepa-
              rated by slashes. For more information about paths,  see  Access
              Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an  opaque  string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the  identifier  of  the  created
                object.  An objects identifier is immutable and no two objects
                will ever share the same object  identifier.  To  identify  an
                object  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier must be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be retrieved in a single  call.  This
          is an approximate number.

       --consistency-level (string)
          Represents  the  manner  and timing in which the successful write or
          update of an object is reflected in a subsequent read  operation  of
          that same object.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --include-all-links-to-each-parent                                    |
       --no-include-all-links-to-each-parent (boolean)
          When set to True, returns all  ListObjectParentsResponse$ParentLinks
          . There could be multiple links between a parent-child pair.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Parents -> (map)
          The  parent  structure, which is a map with key as the ObjectIdenti-
          fier and LinkName as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token.

       ParentLinks -> (list)
          Returns a list of parent reference and LinkName Tuples.

          (structure)
              A pair of ObjectIdentifier and LinkName.

              ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
                 The ID that is associated with the object.

              LinkName -> (string)
                 The name of the link between the parent and the child object.
