CREATE-DIRECTORY()                                          CREATE-DIRECTORY()



NAME
       create-directory -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a   Directory  by copying the published schema into the direc-
       tory. A directory cannot be created without a schema.

       You can also quickly create a directory using a managed schema,  called
       the  QuickStartSchema . For more information, see Managed Schema in the
       Amazon Cloud Directory Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-directory
          --name <value>
          --schema-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the  Directory .  Should  be  unique  per  account,  per
          region.

       --schema-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the published schema that will be
          copied into the data  Directory . For more information, see  arns  .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DirectoryArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  that is associated with the  Directory . For more informa-
          tion, see  arns .

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the  Directory .

       ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
          The root object node of the created directory.

       AppliedSchemaArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the published schema in the  Directory . Once a published
          schema  is  copied  into the directory, it has its own ARN, which is
          referred to applied schema ARN. For more information, see  arns .
