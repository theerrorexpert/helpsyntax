       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            upgrade-published-schema
          --development-schema-arn <value>
          --published-schema-arn <value>
          --minor-version <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --development-schema-arn (string)
          The ARN of the development schema with  the  changes  used  for  the
          upgrade.

       --published-schema-arn (string)
          The ARN of the published schema to be upgraded.

       --minor-version (string)
          Identifies  the  minor  version of the published schema that will be
          created. This parameter is NOT optional.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Used for testing whether the Development schema  provided  is  back-
          wards  compatible,  or  not, with the publish schema provided by the
          user to be upgraded. If schema  compatibility  fails,  an  exception
          would  be  thrown  else  the  call  would succeed. This parameter is
          optional and defaults to false.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UpgradedSchemaArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the upgraded schema that  is  returned  as  part  of  the
          response.
