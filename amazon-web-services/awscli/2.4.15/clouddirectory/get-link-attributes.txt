       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-link-attributes
          --directory-arn <value>
          --typed-link-specifier <value>
          --attribute-names <value>
          [--consistency-level <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the Directory
          where the typed link resides. For more  information,  see   arns  or
          Typed Links .

       --typed-link-specifier (structure)
          Allows a typed link specifier to be accepted as input.

          TypedLinkFacet -> (structure)
              Identifies  the  typed  link  facet  that is associated with the
              typed link.

              SchemaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is  associated  with  the
                 schema. For more information, see  arns .

              TypedLinkName -> (string)
                 The unique name of the typed link facet.

          SourceObjectReference -> (structure)
              Identifies the source object that the typed link will attach to.

              Selector -> (string)
                 A path selector supports easy selection of an object  by  the
                 parent/child links leading to it from the directory root. Use
                 the link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the
                 path.  Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names
                 are separated by slashes. For more information  about  paths,
                 see Access Objects . You can identify an object in one of the
                 following ways:

                 o $ObjectIdentifier -  An  object  identifier  is  an  opaque
                   string  provided  by  Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating
                   objects, the system will provide you with the identifier of
                   the  created object. An objects identifier is immutable and
                   no two objects will ever share the same object  identifier.
                   To  identify  an object with ObjectIdentifier, the ObjectI-
                   dentifier must be wrapped in double quotes.

                 o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

                 o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

          TargetObjectReference -> (structure)
              Identifies the target object that the typed link will attach to.

              Selector -> (string)
                 A path selector supports easy selection of an object  by  the
                 parent/child links leading to it from the directory root. Use
                 the link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the
                 path.  Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names
                 are separated by slashes. For more information  about  paths,
                 see Access Objects . You can identify an object in one of the
                 following ways:

                 o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

                 o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

          IdentityAttributeValues -> (list)
              Identifies the attribute value to update.

              (structure)
                 Identifies the attribute name and value for a typed link.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The attribute name of the typed link.

                 Value -> (structure)
                     The value for the typed link.

                     StringValue -> (string)
                        A string data value.

                     BinaryValue -> (blob)
                        A binary data value.

                     BooleanValue -> (boolean)

                     NumberValue -> (string)
                        A number data value.

                     DatetimeValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date and time value.

              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --attribute-names (list)
          A list of attribute names whose values will be retrieved.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --consistency-level (string)
          The consistency level at which to retrieve the attributes on a typed
          link.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
