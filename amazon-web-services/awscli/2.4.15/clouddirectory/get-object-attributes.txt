DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves attributes within a facet that are associated with an object.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-object-attributes
          --directory-arn <value>
          --object-reference <value>
          [--consistency-level <value>]
          --schema-facet <value>
          --attribute-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with  the   Direc-
          tory where the object resides.

       --object-reference (structure)
          Reference  that  identifies  the  object  whose  attributes  will be
          retrieved.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child  links  leading to it from the directory root. Use the
              link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the  path.
              Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names are sepa-
              rated by slashes. For more information about paths,  see  Access
              Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an  opaque  string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the  identifier  of  the  created
                object.  An objects identifier is immutable and no two objects
                will ever share the same object  identifier.  To  identify  an
                object  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier must be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --consistency-level (string)
          The consistency level at which to  retrieve  the  attributes  on  an
          object.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --schema-facet (structure)
          Identifier  for  the  facet  whose attributes will be retrieved. See
          SchemaFacet for details.

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the schema that contains the facet with no minor com-
              ponent.  See  arns and In-Place Schema Upgrade for a description
              of when to  provide  minor  versions.  If  this  value  is  set,
              FacetName must also be set.

          FacetName -> (string)
              The name of the facet. If this value is set, SchemaArn must also
              be set.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,FacetName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "FacetName": "string"
          }

       --attribute-names (list)
          List of attribute names whose values will be retrieved.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
