NAME
       get-object-information -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata about an object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-object-information
          --directory-arn <value>
          --object-reference <value>
          [--consistency-level <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The ARN of the directory being retrieved.

       --object-reference (structure)
          A reference to the object.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the
              link  names  from  each parent/child link to construct the path.
              Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are  sepa-
              rated  by  slashes. For more information about paths, see Access
              Objects . You can identify an object in  one  of  the  following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system  will  provide  you  with the identifier of the created
                object. An objects identifier is immutable and no two  objects
                will  ever  share  the  same object identifier. To identify an
                object with ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --consistency-level (string)
          The consistency level at which to retrieve the object information.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SchemaFacets -> (list)
          The  facets  attached to the specified object. Although the response
          does not  include  minor  version  information,  the  most  recently
          applied  minor  version of each Facet is in effect. See  GetApplied-
          SchemaVersion for details.

          (structure)
              A facet.

              SchemaArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the schema that contains the facet with  no  minor
                 component.  See   arns  and  In-Place  Schema  Upgrade  for a
                 description of when to provide minor versions. If this  value
                 is set, FacetName must also be set.

              FacetName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the facet. If this value is set, SchemaArn must
                 also be set.

       ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
          The ObjectIdentifier of the specified object.
