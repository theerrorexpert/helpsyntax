SYNOPSIS
            create-index
          --directory-arn <value>
          --ordered-indexed-attribute-list <value>
          --is-unique | --no-is-unique
          [--parent-reference <value>]
          [--link-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The ARN of the directory where the index should be created.

       --ordered-indexed-attribute-list (list)
          Specifies the attributes that should be indexed on. Currently only a
          single attribute is supported.

          (structure)
              A unique identifier for an attribute.

              SchemaArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the schema that contains
                 the facet and attribute.

              FacetName -> (string)
                 The name of the facet that the attribute exists within.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,FacetName=string,Name=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SchemaArn": "string",
              "FacetName": "string",
              "Name": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --is-unique | --no-is-unique (boolean)
          Indicates whether the attribute that is  being  indexed  has  unique
          values or not.

       --parent-reference (structure)
          A reference to the parent object that contains the index object.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the
              link  names  from  each parent/child link to construct the path.
              Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are  sepa-
              rated  by  slashes. For more information about paths, see Access
              Objects . You can identify an object in  one  of  the  following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system  will  provide  you  with the identifier of the created
                object. An objects identifier is immutable and no two  objects
                will  ever  share  the  same object identifier. To identify an
                object with ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --link-name (string)
          The name of the link between the parent object and the index object.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
          The ObjectIdentifier of the index created by this operation.
