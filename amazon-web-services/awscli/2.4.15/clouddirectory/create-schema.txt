CREATE-SCHEMA()                                                CREATE-SCHEMA()



NAME
       create-schema -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  schema  in  a development state. A schema can exist in
       three phases:

       o Development: This is a mutable phase of the schema. All  new  schemas
         are in the development phase. Once the schema is finalized, it can be
         published.

       o Published: Published schemas are immutable and have a version associ-
         ated with them.

       o Applied:  Applied schemas are mutable in a way that allows you to add
         new schema facets. You can also add new,  nonrequired  attributes  to
         existing  schema  facets.  You  can  apply  only published schemas to
         directories.

SYNOPSIS
            create-schema
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name that is associated with the schema. This is unique to  each
          account and in each region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SchemaArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the schema.
