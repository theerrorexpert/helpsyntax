DELETE-DATA-INTEGRATION()                            DELETE-DATA-INTEGRATION()



NAME
       delete-data-integration -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the DataIntegration. Only DataIntegrations that don't have any
       DataIntegrationAssociations can be deleted. Deleting a  DataIntegration
       also  deletes  the  underlying  Amazon  AppFlow flow and service linked
       role.

       NOTE:
          You cannot create a DataIntegration association for  a  DataIntegra-
          tion  that has been previously associated. Use a different DataInte-
          gration,    or    recreate    the    DataIntegration    using    the
          CreateDataIntegration API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-data-integration
          --data-integration-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --data-integration-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for the DataIntegration.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
