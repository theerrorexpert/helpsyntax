DESCRIBE-EVENT-AGGREGATES()                        DESCRIBE-EVENT-AGGREGATES()



NAME
       describe-event-aggregates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  number  of  events  of  each event type (issue, scheduled
       change, and account notification).  If  no  filter  is  specified,  the
       counts of all events in each category are returned.

       NOTE:
          This  API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken parameter
          in the next request to return more results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-event-aggregates is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: eventAggregates

       --aggregate-field (string)
          The only currently supported value is eventTypeCategory .

          Possible values:

          o eventTypeCategory

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       eventAggregates -> (list)
          The  number of events in each category that meet the optional filter
          criteria.

          (structure)
              The number of  events  of  each  issue  type.  Returned  by  the
              DescribeEventAggregates operation.

              aggregateValue -> (string)
                 The issue type for the associated count.

              count -> (integer)
                 The number of events of the associated issue type.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results
          are returned, and a nextToken pagination token is  returned  in  the
          response.  To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search
          request and include the returned token. When all results  have  been
          returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
