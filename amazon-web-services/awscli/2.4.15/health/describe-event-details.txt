DESCRIBE-EVENT-DETAILS()                              DESCRIBE-EVENT-DETAILS()



NAME
       describe-event-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed information about one or more specified events. Infor-
       mation includes standard event data (Amazon Web Services  Region,  ser-
       vice,  and  so  on,  as  returned by DescribeEvents ), a detailed event
       description, and possible additional metadata  that  depends  upon  the
       nature  of  the  event. Affected entities are not included. To retrieve
       the entities, use the DescribeAffectedEntities operation.

       If a specified event can't be retrieved, an error message  is  returned
       for that event.

       NOTE:
          This operation supports resource-level permissions. You can use this
          operation to allow or deny access to  specific  Health  events.  For
          more  information,  see Resource- and action-based conditions in the
          Health User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-event-details
          --event-arns <value>
          [--locale <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-arns (list)
          A  list  of  event   ARNs   (unique   identifiers).   For   example:
          "arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
          ULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-CDE456",
          "arn:aws:health:us-west-1::event/EBS/AWS_EBS_LOST_VOL-
          UME/AWS_EBS_LOST_VOLUME_CHI789_JKL101"

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --locale (string)
          The locale (language) to return information in. English (en) is  the
          default and the only supported value at this time.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                 /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                 For example, an event ARN might look like the following:
                     arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
