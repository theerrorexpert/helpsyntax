DESCRIBE-AFFECTED-ENTITIES()                      DESCRIBE-AFFECTED-ENTITIES()



NAME
       describe-affected-entities -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  entities that have been affected by the specified
       events, based on the specified filter criteria. Entities can  refer  to
       individual  customer  resources,  groups  of customer resources, or any
       other construct, depending on the Amazon Web Services  service.  Events
       that  have  impact  beyond  that of the affected entities, or where the
       extent of impact is unknown, include at  least  one  entity  indicating
       this.

       At least one event ARN is required.

       NOTE:

          o This  API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken parame-
            ter in the next request to return more results.

          o This operation supports resource-level permissions.  You  can  use
            this  operation to allow or deny access to specific Health events.
            For more information, see Resource- and action-based conditions in
            the Health User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-affected-entities is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: entities

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Values to narrow the results returned. At least  one  event  ARN  is
          required.

          eventArns -> (list)
              A   list  of  event  ARNs  (unique  identifiers).  For  example:
              "arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
              MENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-CDE456",
              "arn:aws:health:us-west-1::event/EBS/AWS_EBS_LOST_VOL-
              UME/AWS_EBS_LOST_VOLUME_CHI789_JKL101"

              (string)

          entityArns -> (list)
              A list of entity ARNs (unique identifiers).

              (string)

          entityValues -> (list)
              A list of IDs for affected entities.

              (string)

          lastUpdatedTimes -> (list)
              A  list  of  the most recent dates and times that the entity was
              updated.

              (structure)
                 A range of dates and times that is used  by  the  EventFilter
                 and EntityFilter objects. If from is set and to is set: match
                 items where the timestamp (startTime , endTime ,  or  lastUp-
                 datedTime  ) is between from and to inclusive. If from is set
                 and to is not set: match items where the timestamp  value  is
                 equal  to  or  after from . If from is not set and to is set:
                 match items where the timestamp value is equal to  or  before
                 to .

                 from -> (timestamp)
                     The starting date and time of a time range.

                 to -> (timestamp)
                     The ending date and time of a time range.

          tags -> (list)
              A map of entity tags attached to the affected entity.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, the tags property isn't supported.

              (map)
                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

          statusCodes -> (list)
              A  list  of  entity  status  codes  (IMPAIRED  , UNIMPAIRED , or
              UNKNOWN ).

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          eventArns=string,string,entityArns=string,string,entityValues=string,string,lastUpdatedTimes=[{from=timestamp,to=timestamp},{from=timestamp,to=timestamp}],tags=[{KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},{KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}],statusCodes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "eventArns": ["string", ...],
            "entityArns": ["string", ...],
            "entityValues": ["string", ...],
            "lastUpdatedTimes": [
              {
                "from": timestamp,
                "to": timestamp
              }
              ...
            ],
            "tags": [
              {"string": "string"
                ...}
              ...
            ],
            "statusCodes": ["IMPAIRED"|"UNIMPAIRED"|"UNKNOWN", ...]
          }

       --locale (string)
          The locale (language) to return information in. English (en) is  the
          default and the only supported value at this time.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the entities that are affected by a specified AWS Health event

       The following describe-affected-entities  example  lists  the  entities
       that  are  affected  by the specified AWS Health event. This event is a
       billing notification for the AWS account.

          aws health describe-affected-entities \
              --filter "eventArns=arn:aws:health:global::event/BILLING/AWS_BILLING_NOTIFICATION/AWS_BILLING_NOTIFICATION_6ce1d874-e995-40e2-99cd-EXAMPLE11145" \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "entities": [
                  {
                      "entityArn": "arn:aws:health:global:123456789012:entity/EXAMPLEimSMoULmWHpb",
                      "eventArn": "arn:aws:health:global::event/BILLING/AWS_BILLING_NOTIFICATION/AWS_BILLING_NOTIFICATION_6ce1d874-e995-40e2-99cd-EXAMPLE11145",
                      "entityValue": "AWS_ACCOUNT",
                      "awsAccountId": "123456789012",
                      "lastUpdatedTime": 1588356454.08
                  }
              ]
          }
