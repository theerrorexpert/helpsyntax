NAME
       describe-affected-entities-for-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  entities  that  have been affected by one or more
       events for one or more accounts in your organization in  Organizations,
       based on the filter criteria. Entities can refer to individual customer
       resources, groups  of  customer  resources,  or  any  other  construct,
       depending on the Amazon Web Services service.

       At  least  one  event  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) and account ID are
       required.

       Before you can call this operation, you must  first  enable  Health  to
       work     with     Organizations.     To     do     this,    call    the
       EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization operation from your  organiza-
       tion's management account.

       NOTE:

          o This  API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken parame-
            ter in the next request to return more results.

          o This operation doesn't  support  resource-level  permissions.  You
            can't  use  this  operation  to  allow  or deny access to specific
            Health  events.  For   more   information,   see   Resource-   and
            action-based conditions in the Health User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-affected-entities-for-organization  is  a paginated operation.
       Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data
       set  of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-pagi-
       nate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a
       paginated  response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the
       results of the following query expressions: entities

SYNOPSIS
            describe-affected-entities-for-organization
          --organization-entity-filters <value>
          [--locale <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-entity-filters (list)
          A JSON set of elements including the awsAccountId and the eventArn .

          (structure)
              The     values    used    to    filter    results    from    the
              DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization                          and
              DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization operations.

              eventArn -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
                 ``
                 arn:aws:health:event-region  ::event/SERVICE /EVENT_TYPE_CODE
                 /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                 For example, an event ARN might look like the following:
                     arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
                     MENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
                     ULED_ABC123-DEF456

              awsAccountId -> (string)
                 The 12-digit Amazon Web Services account  numbers  that  con-
                 tains the affected entities.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          eventArn=string,awsAccountId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "eventArn": "string",
              "awsAccountId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --locale (string)
          The  locale (language) to return information in. English (en) is the
          default and the only supported value at this time.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          request and include the returned token. When all results  have  been
          returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
