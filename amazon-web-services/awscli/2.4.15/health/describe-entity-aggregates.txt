NAME
       describe-entity-aggregates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the number of entities that are affected by each of the speci-
       fied events.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-entity-aggregates
          [--event-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-arns (list)
          A  list  of  event   ARNs   (unique   identifiers).   For   example:
          "arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
          ULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-CDE456",
          "arn:aws:health:us-west-1::event/EBS/AWS_EBS_LOST_VOL-
          UME/AWS_EBS_LOST_VOLUME_CHI789_JKL101"

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       entityAggregates -> (list)
          The number of entities that are affected by each  of  the  specified
          events.

          (structure)
              The  number of entities that are affected by one or more events.
              Returned by the DescribeEntityAggregates operation.

              eventArn -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
                 ``
                 arn:aws:health:event-region ::event/SERVICE  /EVENT_TYPE_CODE
                 /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                 For example, an event ARN might look like the following:
                     arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
                     MENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
                     ULED_ABC123-DEF456

              count -> (integer)
                 The number of entities that match the criteria for the speci-
                 fied events.
