HEALTH()                                                              HEALTH()



NAME
       health -

DESCRIPTION
       The  Health  API provides programmatic access to the Health information
       that appears in the Personal Health Dashboard . You  can  use  the  API
       operations  to get information about events that might affect your Ama-
       zon Web Services services and resources.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port  plan from Amazon Web Services Support to use the Health API.
            If you call the Health API from an  Amazon  Web  Services  account
            that  doesn't  have  a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error.

          o You can use  the  Health  endpoint  health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
            (HTTPS)  to  call  the  Health  API  operations. Health supports a
            multi-Region application architecture and has  two  regional  end-
            points  in  an  active-passive configuration. You can use the high
            availability endpoint example to determine which Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices Region is active, so that you can get the latest information
            from the API. For more information, see Accessing the  Health  API
            in the Health User Guide .

       For  authentication  of  requests,  Health uses the Signature Version 4
       Signing Process .

       If your Amazon Web Services account is part of Organizations,  you  can
       use  the  Health  organizational  view feature. This feature provides a
       centralized view of Health events across all accounts in your organiza-
       tion. You can aggregate Health events in real time to identify accounts
       in your organization that are affected by an operational event  or  get
       notified  of  security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API
       operations to enable this feature and  return  event  information.  For
       more  information,  see  Aggregating  Health  events in the Health User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          When you use the Health API operations to return Health events,  see
          the following recommendations:

          o Use  the  eventScopeCode  parameter  to  specify whether to return
            Health events that are public or account-specific.

          o Use pagination to view all events from the response. For  example,
            if you call the DescribeEventsForOrganization operation to get all
            events in  your  organization,  you  might  receive  several  page
            results.  Specify the nextToken in the next request to return more
            results.
