NAME
       enable-health-service-access-for-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  Health  to  work with Organizations. You can use the organiza-
       tional view feature to aggregate events from all  Amazon  Web  Services
       accounts in your organization in a centralized location.

       This  operation  also  creates a service-linked role for the management
       account in the organization.

       NOTE:
          To call this operation, you must meet the following requirements:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port  plan from Amazon Web Services Support to use the Health API.
            If you call the Health API from an  Amazon  Web  Services  account
            that  doesn't  have  a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error.

          o You must have permission to call this operation from the organiza-
            tion's  management  account.  For example IAM policies, see Health
            identity-based policy examples .

       If you don't have the required support plan, you can  instead  use  the
       Health  console  to  enable  the  organizational view feature. For more
       information, see Aggregating Health events in the Health User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            enable-health-service-access-for-organization
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
