DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about events that meet the specified filter crite-
       ria. Events are returned in a summary  form  and  do  not  include  the
       detailed description, any additional metadata that depends on the event
       type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use  the
       DescribeEventDetails and DescribeAffectedEntities operations.

       If  no  filter criteria are specified, all events are returned. Results
       are sorted by lastModifiedTime , starting with the most recent event.

       NOTE:

          o When you call the DescribeEvents operation and specify  an  entity
            for  the entityValues parameter, Health might return public events
            that aren't specific to that resource. For example,  if  you  call
            DescribeEvents  and  specify  an  ID for an Amazon Elastic Compute
            Cloud (Amazon EC2)  instance,  Health  might  return  events  that
            aren't  specific  to  that resource or service. To get events that
            are specific to a service, use the services parameter in the  fil-
            ter object. For more information, see Event .

          o This  API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken parame-
            ter in the next request to return more results.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: events

       --locale (string)
          The locale (language) to return information in. English (en) is  the
          default and the only supported value at this time.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       Example 2: To list AWS Health events by service and event status code

       The  following describe-events example lists AWS Health events for Ama-
       zon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Amazon  EC2)  where  the  event  status  is
       closed.

          aws health describe-events \

OUTPUT
       events -> (list)
          The events that match the specified filter criteria.

          (structure)
              Summary information about an Health event.

              Health events can be public or account-specific:

              o Public events might be service events that are not specific to
                an  Amazon  Web  Services account. For example, if there is an
                issue with an Amazon  Web  Services  Region,  Health  provides
                information about the event, even if you don't use services or
                resources in that Region.

              o Account-specific events are specific to either your Amazon Web
                Services account or an account in your organization. For exam-
                ple, if there's an issue with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  in
                a  Region  that you use, Health provides information about the
                event and the affected resources in the account.

              You can determine if an event is public or  account-specific  by
              using  the  eventScopeCode  parameter. For more information, see
              eventScopeCode .

              arn -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
                 ``
                 arn:aws:health:event-region ::event/SERVICE  /EVENT_TYPE_CODE
                 /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                 For example, an event ARN might look like the following:
                     arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
                     MENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
                     ULED_ABC123-DEF456

              service -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  service  that  is affected by the
                 event. For example, EC2 , RDS .

              eventTypeCode -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for  the  event  type.  The  format  is
                 AWS_*SERVICE* _*DESCRIPTION* `` ; for example, ``AWS_EC2_SYS-
                 TEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT .

              eventTypeCategory -> (string)
                 A list of event type  category  codes.  Possible  values  are
                 issue , accountNotification , or scheduledChange . Currently,
                 the investigation value isn't supported at this time.

              region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region name of the event.

              availabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Availability Zone of the  event.  For
                 example, us-east-1a.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the event began.

              endTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the event ended.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The most recent date and time that the event was updated.

              statusCode -> (string)
                 The most recent status of the event. Possible values are open
                 , closed , and upcoming .

              eventScopeCode -> (string)
                 This parameter specifies if the Health event is a public Ama-
                 zon  Web Services service event or an account-specific event.

                 o If  the  eventScopeCode  value  is  PUBLIC   ,   then   the
                   affectedAccounts value is always empty.

                 o If  the eventScopeCode value is ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC , then the
                   affectedAccounts value lists the affected Amazon  Web  Ser-
                   vices  accounts  in  your  organization. For example, if an
                   event affects a service  such  as  Amazon  Elastic  Compute
                   Cloud  and  you  have Amazon Web Services accounts that use
                   that service, those account IDs appear in the response.

                 o If the eventScopeCode value is NONE  ,  then  the  eventArn
                   that  you  specified  in  the request is invalid or doesn't
                   exist.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the  results
          are  returned,  and  a nextToken pagination token is returned in the
          response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the  search
          request  and  include the returned token. When all results have been
          returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.



                                                             DESCRIBE-EVENTS()
