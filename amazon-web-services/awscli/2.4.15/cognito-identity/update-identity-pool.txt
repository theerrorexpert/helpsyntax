OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id (string)
          An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.

       --identity-pool-name (string)
          A string that you provide.

       --allow-unauthenticated-identities | --no-allow-unauthenticated-identi-
       ties (boolean)
          TRUE if the identity pool supports unauthenticated logins.

       --allow-classic-flow | --no-allow-classic-flow (boolean)

          tication Flow in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

       --supported-login-providers (map)
          Optional key:value pairs mapping provider names to provider app IDs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --developer-provider-name (string)
          The "domain" by which Cognito will refer to your users.

       --open-id-connect-provider-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the OpenID Connect providers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cognito-identity-providers (list)
          A list representing an Amazon Cognito user pool and its client ID.

          (structure)
              A  provider  representing  an  Amazon  Cognito user pool and its
              client ID.

              ProviderName -> (string)
                 The provider name for an Amazon Cognito user pool. For  exam-
                 ple,  cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_123456789
                 .

              ServerSideTokenCheck -> (boolean)
                 TRUE if server-side token validation is enabled for the iden-
                 tity providers token.

                 Once  you  set  ServerSideTokenCheck  to TRUE for an identity
                 pool, that identity pool will check with the integrated  user
                 pools to make sure that the user has not been globally signed
                 out or deleted before the  identity  pool  provides  an  OIDC
                 token or AWS credentials for the user.

                 If  the user is signed out or deleted, the identity pool will
                 return a 400 Not Authorized error.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ClientId=string,ServerSideTokenCheck=boolean ...

              "ServerSideTokenCheck": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --saml-provider-arns (list)
          An array of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the  SAML  provider  for
          your identity pool.

          "string" "string" ...

       --identity-pool-tags (map)
          The  tags  that  are assigned to the identity pool. A tag is a label
          that you can apply to identity pools to categorize and  manage  them
          in  different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other
          criteria.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update an identity pool

       This example updates an identity pool. It sets the name to  MyIdentity-
       Pool.  It adds Cognito as an identity provider.  It disallows unauthen-
       ticated identities.

       Command:

          aws cognito-identity update-identity-pool --identity-pool-id "us-west-2:11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" --identity-pool-name "MyIdentityPool" --no-allow-unauthenticated-identities --cognito-identity-providers ProviderName="cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_111111111",ClientId="3n4b5urk1ft4fl3mg5e62d9ado",ServerSideTokenCheck=false

       Output:

          {
            "IdentityPoolId": "us-west-2:11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
            "IdentityPoolName": "MyIdentityPool",
            "AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities": false,
            "CognitoIdentityProviders": [
                {
                    "ProviderName": "cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_111111111",
                    "ClientId": "3n4b5urk1ft4fl3mg5e62d9ado",
                    "ServerSideTokenCheck": false
                }
            ]
          }

          Enables or disables the Basic  (Classic)  authentication  flow.  For
          more  information, see Identity Pools (Federated Identities) Authen-
          tication Flow in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

              A  provider  representing  an  Amazon  Cognito user pool and its
              client ID.

              ProviderName -> (string)
                 The provider name for an Amazon Cognito user pool. For  exam-

                 Once  you  set  ServerSideTokenCheck  to TRUE for an identity

                 out or deleted before the  identity  pool  provides  an  OIDC
