APPCONFIG()                                                        APPCONFIG()



NAME
       appconfig -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  AppConfig, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, to
       create, manage, and quickly deploy application configurations.  AppCon-
       fig  supports  controlled  deployments  to applications of any size and
       includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppCon-
       fig  with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, contain-
       ers, mobile applications, or IoT devices.

       To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially
       for  production  systems  where a simple typo could cause an unexpected
       outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic
       or  semantic  check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy
       works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you
       provide  a schema or a Lambda function that runs against the configura-
       tion. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when  the
       configuration data is valid.

       During  a  configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application
       to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the  system  encounters
       an  error,  AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your
       application users. You can configure a  deployment  strategy  for  each
       application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including
       velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to  error  monitor-
       ing,  if  a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls
       back to the previous version.

       AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:

       o Application tuning : Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes  to
         your application that can only be tested with production traffic.

       o Feature toggle : Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a
         timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement.

       o Allow list : Use AppConfig to allow  premium  subscribers  to  access
         paid content.

       o Operational  issues : Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your applica-
         tion when a dependency or other external factor impacts the system.
