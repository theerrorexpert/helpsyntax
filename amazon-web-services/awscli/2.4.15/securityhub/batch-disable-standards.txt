NAME
       batch-disable-standards -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  the  standards  specified  by the provided StandardsSubscrip-
       tionArns .

       For more information, see Security Standards section  of  the  Security
       Hub User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-disable-standards
          --standards-subscription-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --standards-subscription-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the standards subscriptions to disable.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disable a standard

       The  following  batch-disable-standards  example  disables the standard
       associated with the specified subscription ARN.

          aws securityhub batch-disable-standards \
              --standards-subscription-arns "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"

       Output:

          {
              "StandardsSubscriptions": [
                  {
                      "StandardsArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:eu-central-1::standards/pci-dss/v/3.2.1",
                      "StandardsInput": { },
                      "StandardsStatus": "DELETING",
                      "StandardsSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       StandardsSubscriptions -> (list)
          The details of the standards subscriptions that were disabled.

          (structure)
              A  resource  that  represents  your  subscription to a supported
              standard.

              StandardsSubscriptionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a resource that represents your subscription to  a
                 supported standard.

              StandardsArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a standard.

              StandardsInput -> (map)
                 A key-value pair of input for the standard.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              StandardsStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the standard subscription.

                 The status values are as follows:

                 o PENDING - Standard is in the process of being enabled.

                 o READY - Standard is enabled.

                 o INCOMPLETE - Standard could not be enabled completely. Some
                   controls may not be available.

                 o DELETING - Standard is in the process of being disabled.

                 o FAILED - Standard could not be disabled.

              StandardsStatusReason -> (structure)
                 The reason for the current status.

                 StatusReasonCode -> (string)
                     The reason code that represents the reason for  the  cur-
                     rent status of a standard subscription.
