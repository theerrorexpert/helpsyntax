CREATE-MEMBERS()                                              CREATE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       create-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  member  association  in  Security Hub between the specified
       accounts and the account used to make the request, which is the  admin-
       istrator  account.  If  you are integrated with Organizations, then the
       administrator account is  designated  by  the  organization  management
       account.
          CreateMembers  is always used to add accounts that are not organiza-
          tion members.

       For accounts that are managed  using  Organizations,  CreateMembers  is
       only used in the following cases:

       o Security  Hub is not configured to automatically add new organization
         accounts.

       o The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.

       This action can only be used  by  an  account  that  has  Security  Hub
       enabled.  To  enable  Security  Hub,  you can use the EnableSecurityHub
       operation.

       For accounts that are not organization members, you create the  account
       association  and then send an invitation to the member account. To send
       the invitation, you use the InviteMembers  operation.  If  the  account
       owner  accepts  the invitation, the account becomes a member account in
       Security Hub.

       Accounts that are managed using Organizations do not receive an invita-
       tion. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub.

       o If  the organization account does not have Security Hub enabled, then
         Security Hub and the default  standards  are  automatically  enabled.
         Note  that Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the orga-
         nization management account. The organization management account must
         enable  Security Hub before the administrator account enables it as a
         member account.

       o For organization accounts that already  have  Security  Hub  enabled,
         Security  Hub  does  not make any other changes to those accounts. It
         does not change their enabled standards or controls.

       A permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to
       view the findings generated in the member account.

       To   remove  the  association  between  the  administrator  and  member
       accounts, use the DisassociateFromMasterAccount or  DisassociateMembers
       operation.

SYNOPSIS
            create-members
          --account-details <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-details (list)
          The  list of accounts to associate with the Security Hub administra-
          tor account. For each account, the list includes the account ID  and
          optionally the email address.

          (structure)
              The details of an Amazon Web Services account.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The ID of an Amazon Web Services account.

              Email -> (string)
                 The email of an Amazon Web Services account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,Email=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AccountId": "string",
              "Email": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add accounts as member accounts

       The  following  create-members  example  adds  two  accounts  as member
       accounts to the requesting administrator account.

          aws securityhub create-members \
              --account-details '[{"AccountId": "123456789111"}, {"AccountId": "123456789222"}]'

       Output:

          {
              "UnprocessedAccounts": []
          }
