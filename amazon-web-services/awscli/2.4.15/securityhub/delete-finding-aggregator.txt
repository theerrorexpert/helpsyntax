DELETE-FINDING-AGGREGATOR()                        DELETE-FINDING-AGGREGATOR()



NAME
       delete-finding-aggregator -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  finding aggregator. When you delete the finding aggregator,
       you stop finding aggregation.

       When you stop finding aggregation, findings that  were  already  aggre-
       gated  to the aggregation Region are still visible from the aggregation
       Region. New findings and finding updates are not aggregated.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-finding-aggregator
          --finding-aggregator-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --finding-aggregator-arn (string)
          The ARN of the finding aggregator to delete. To obtain the ARN,  use
          ListFindingAggregators .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop finding aggregation

       The  following delete-finding-aggregator example stops finding aggrega-
       tion. It is run from US  East  (Virginia),  which  is  the  aggregation
       Region.

          aws securityhub delete-finding-aggregator \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --finding-aggregator-arn arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:222222222222:finding-aggregator/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426652340000

       This command produces no output.

       rity Hub User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
