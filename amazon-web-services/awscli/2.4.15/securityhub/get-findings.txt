GET-FINDINGS()                                                  GET-FINDINGS()



NAME
       get-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of findings that match the specified criteria.

       If  finding aggregation is enabled, then when you call GetFindings from
       the aggregation Region, the results include all of the  matching  find-
       ings from both the aggregation Region and the linked Regions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-findings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Findings

SYNOPSIS
            get-findings
          [--filters <value>]
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          The finding attributes used to define  a  condition  to  filter  the
          returned findings.

          You  can  filter by up to 10 finding attributes. For each attribute,
          you can provide up to 20 filter values.

          Note that in the available filter fields,  WorkflowState  is  depre-
          cated.  To  search  for  a finding based on its workflow status, use
          WorkflowStatus .

          ProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN generated by Security Hub  that  uniquely  identifies  a
              third-party  company  (security  findings  provider)  after this
              provider's product (solution that generates findings) is  regis-
              tered with Security Hub.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          AwsAccountId -> (list)
              The  Amazon  Web Services account ID that a finding is generated
              in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-

                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same

                        matches all of those filters.

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Region -> (list)
              The Region from which the finding was generated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same

          Type -> (list)
              A finding type in the  format  of  namespace/category/classifier
              that classifies a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)

                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Confidence -> (list)
              A  finding's confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood
              that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue  that
              it was intended to identify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The less-than-equal condition to be applied to  a  single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Criticality -> (list)
              The level of importance assigned  to  the  resources  associated
              with the finding.

              A  score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved  for  the  most  critical
              resources.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Title -> (list)
              A finding's title.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-

                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,

                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          SourceUrl -> (list)
              A  URL  that  links  to  a page about the current finding in the
              security-findings provider's solution.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ProductFields -> (list)
              A data type where security-findings providers can include  addi-
              tional solution-specific details that aren't part of the defined
              AwsSecurityFinding format.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for querying findings. Each map filter  provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department EQUALS Security matches  findings  that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To  search  for  values  other than the filter value, use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
                        finding matches if it matches any one  of  those  fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        . A finding matches only if it matches  all  of  those
                        filters.

                     You  cannot  have  both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ProductName -> (list)
              The name of the solution (product) that generates findings.

              Note that this is a filter against the  aws/securityhub/Product-
              Name  field  in  ProductFields  .  It  is  not  a filter for the
              top-level ProductName field.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          CompanyName -> (list)
              The name of the findings provider (company) that owns the  solu-
              tion (product) that generates findings.

              Note  that this is a filter against the aws/securityhub/Company-
              Name field in ProductFields  .  It  is  not  a  filter  for  the
              top-level CompanyName field.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-

                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first

              A  list  of name/value string pairs associated with the finding.
              These are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for querying findings. Each map filter  provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department EQUALS Security matches  findings  that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To  search  for  values  other than the filter value, use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
                        finding matches if it matches any one  of  those  fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        . A finding matches only if it matches  all  of  those
                        filters.

                     You  cannot  have  both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          MalwareName -> (list)
              The name of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          NetworkDirection -> (list)
              Indicates the direction of network  traffic  associated  with  a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of

                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

              (structure)
                 The IP filter for querying findings.

                 Cidr -> (string)
                     A finding's CIDR value.

          NetworkSourcePort -> (list)
              The  source port of network-related information about a finding.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          NetworkSourceMac -> (list)
              The source media access control (MAC) address of network-related
              information about a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          NetworkDestinationDomain -> (list)
              The  destination  domain  of network-related information about a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ThreatIntelIndicatorLastObservedAt -> (list)
              The date/time of the last observation of a  threat  intelligence
              indicator.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ThreatIntelIndicatorSource -> (list)
              The source of the threat intelligence.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourcePartition -> (list)
              The canonical Amazon Web Services partition name that the Region
              is assigned to.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-

                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first

          ResourceRegion -> (list)
              The canonical Amazon Web Services  external  Region  name  where
              this resource is located.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start

                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceTags -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a resource at
              the time the finding was processed.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for querying findings. Each map filter  provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department EQUALS Security matches  findings  that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To  search  for  values  other than the filter value, use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
                        finding matches if it matches any one  of  those  fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        . A finding matches only if it matches  all  of  those
                        filters.

                     You  cannot  have  both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)
              The instance type of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceImageId -> (list)
              The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 The IP filter for querying findings.

                 Cidr -> (string)
                     A finding's CIDR value.

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceIpV6Addresses -> (list)
              The IPv6 addresses associated with the instance.

              The key name associated with the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same

                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceSubnetId -> (list)
              The identifier of the subnet that the instance was launched  in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerId -> (list)
              The canonical user ID of the owner of the S3 bucket.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyPrincipalName -> (list)
              The name of the principal that is associated with an IAM  access
              key.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.

                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,

                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first

                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

          ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)
              The date/time that the container was started.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
              The details of a resource that doesn't have a specific  subfield
              for the resource type defined.

              (structure)
                 A  map filter for querying findings. Each map filter provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  EQUALS Security matches findings that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To search for values other than  the  filter  value,  use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by OR .  A
                        finding  matches  if  it matches any one of those fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        .  A  finding  matches only if it matches all of those
                        filters.

                     You cannot have both an EQUALS filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ComplianceStatus -> (list)
              Exclusive  to  findings  that  are  generated as the result of a
              check run against a specific rule in a supported standard,  such
              as  CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations. Contains security stan-
              dard-related finding details.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter  value,  use  NOT_EQUALS  . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining  filters  in  this  way always returns an
                     error, even if the provided filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          VerificationState -> (list)
              The veracity of a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.

                       ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same

          WorkflowState -> (list)
              The workflow state of a finding.

              Note that this field is deprecated.  To  search  for  a  finding
              based on its workflow status, use WorkflowStatus .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          WorkflowStatus -> (list)
              The  status  of the investigation into a finding. Allowed values
              are the following.

              o NEW - The initial state of a finding, before it  is  reviewed.
                Security  Hub also resets the workflow status from NOTIFIED or
                RESOLVED to NEW in the following cases:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to  either  WARNING  ,
                  FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o NOTIFIED - Indicates that the resource owner has been notified
                about the security issue. Used when the  initial  reviewer  is
                not  the  resource  owner,  and  needs  intervention  from the
                resource owner. If one of the following occurs,  the  workflow
                status is changed automatically from NOTIFIED to NEW :

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you reviewed the  finding  and  do
                not  believe that any action is needed. The workflow status of
                a SUPPRESSED finding does not change  if  RecordState  changes
                from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

              o RESOLVED  - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now
                considered resolved.  The finding remains RESOLVED unless  one
                of the following occurs:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              In those cases, the workflow status is  automatically  reset  to
              NEW .

              For  findings  from  controls,  if Compliance.Status is PASSED ,
              then Security Hub automatically  sets  the  workflow  status  to
              RESOLVED .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

          RecordState -> (list)
              The updated record state for the finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
              The timestamp of when the note was updated.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
              The principal that created a note.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Keyword -> (list)
              A keyword for a finding.

              (structure)
                 A keyword filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value for the keyword.

          FindingProviderFieldsConfidence -> (list)
              The  finding  provider  value for the finding confidence. Confi-
              dence is defined as the likelihood  that  a  finding  accurately
              identifies  the  behavior or issue that it was intended to iden-
              tify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsCriticality -> (list)
              The  finding provider value for the level of importance assigned
              to the resources associated with the findings.

              A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no  criti-
              cality,  and  a  score  of 100 is reserved for the most critical
              resources.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsId -> (list)
              The  finding  identifier of a related finding that is identified
              by the finding provider.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-

                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with

                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.

          FindingProviderFieldsSeverityLabel -> (list)
              The finding provider value for the severity label.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS .  For  example,  the  filter
                       ResourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy matches findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in  this  way  always  returns  an
                     error,  even  if  the provided filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

       --sort-criteria (list)
          The finding attributes used to sort the list of returned findings.

          (structure)
              A collection of finding attributes used to sort findings.

              Field -> (string)
                 The finding attribute used to sort findings.

              SortOrder -> (string)
                 The order used to sort findings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Field=string,SortOrder=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Field": "string",
              "SortOrder": "asc"|"desc"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To return findings generated for a specific standard

       The  following  get-findings  example  returns findings for the PCI DSS

       Example 2: To return critical-severity findings that  have  a  workflow
       status of NOTIFIED

       The  following get-findings example returns findings that have a sever-
       ity label value of CRITICAL and a  workflow  status  of  NOTIFIED.  The
       results are sorted in descending order by the value of Confidence.

          aws securityhub get-findings \
              --filters '{"SeverityLabel":[{"Value": "CRITICAL","Comparison":"EQUALS"}],"WorkflowStatus": [{"Value":"NOTIFIED","Comparison":"EQUALS"}]}' \
              --sort-criteria '{ "Field": "Confidence", "SortOrder": "desc"}' \

              to share findings between Amazon Web Services security  services
              and third-party solutions, and security standards checks.

              NOTE:
                 A  finding  is a potential security issue generated either by
                 Amazon Web Services services or by the integrated third-party
                 solutions and standards checks.

                                   If  cross-zone  load  balancing is enabled,
                                   the load balancer routes the request  traf-
                                   fic  evenly across all instances regardless
                                   of the Availability Zones.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          Specifies   how   you  want  WAF  to
                                          respond to requests that  match  the
                                          settings in a rule.

                                          Valid  settings  include the follow-
                                          ing:

                                          o ALLOW - WAF allows requests

                                          o BLOCK - WAF blocks requests

                                            of  the requests that match all of
                                            the conditions in  the  rule.  WAF
                                            then  continues to inspect the web
                                            request  based  on  the  remaining
                                            rules  in  the  web ACL. You can't
                                            specify  COUNT  for  the   default
                                            action for a WebACL.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      Rules to exclude from a rule group.

                                      (structure)
                                          Details about a rule to exclude from
                                          a rule group.

                                          RuleId -> (string)
                                             The  unique  identifier  for  the
                                             rule  to  exclude  from  the rule
                                             group.

                                   OverrideAction -> (structure)
                                      Use  the  OverrideAction  to  test  your
                                      RuleGroup.

                                      Any  rule in a RuleGroup can potentially
                                      block a request. If you  set  the  Over-
                                      rideAction   to  None  ,  the  RuleGroup
                                      blocks a request if any individual  rule
                                      in the RuleGroup matches the request and
                                      is configured to block that request.

                                      However, if you first want to  test  the
                                      RuleGroup,  set  the  OverrideAction  to
                                      Count . The RuleGroup then overrides any
                                      block  action  specified  by  individual
                                      rules  contained   within   the   group.
                                      Instead  of  blocking matching requests,
                                      those requests are counted.
                                          ActivatedRule
                                          |
                                          OverrideAction  applies  only   when
                                          updating  or adding a RuleGroup to a
                                          WebACL. In this case you do not  use
                                          ActivatedRule
                                          |
                                          Action   .   For  all  other  update
                                          requests, ActivatedRule
                                          |
                                          Action is used instead of  Activate-
                                          dRule
                                          |
                                          OverrideAction .

                                      Type -> (string)
                                             COUNT overrides the action speci-
                                             fied  by  the   individual   rule
                                             within a RuleGroup .

                                          If  set  to NONE , the rule's action
                                          takes place.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Specifies the order in which  the  rules
                                      in  a WebACL are evaluated. Rules with a
                                      lower value for Priority  are  evaluated
                                      before  rules  with  a higher value. The
                                      value must be a unique integer.  If  you
                                      add multiple rules to a WebACL, the val-
                                      ues do not need to be consecutive.

                                   RuleId -> (string)
                                      The identifier for a rule.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      The rule type.

                               the service. The role  allows  the  Amazon  ECS
                               container agent to register container instances
                               with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer.

                            SchedulingStrategy -> (string)

                               The  REPLICA  scheduling  strategy  places  and
                               maintains the desired number  of  tasks  across
                               the  cluster. By default, the service scheduler
                               spreads tasks across Availability  Zones.  Task
                               placement  strategies  and constraints are used
                               to customize task placement decisions.

                               The DAEMON scheduling strategy deploys  exactly
                               one task on each active container instance that
                               meets all of  the  task  placement  constraints
                               that  are specified in the cluster. The service
                               scheduler also  evaluates  the  task  placement
                               constraints  for  running tasks and stops tasks
                               that do not meet the placement constraints.

                                   mizes downtime if a  node  or  data  center
                                   fails.

                         ING , FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     o NOTIFIED - Indicates that  you  notified  the  resource
                       owner  about  the security issue. Used when the initial
                       reviewer is not the resource owner, and needs interven-
                       tion from the resource owner.

                     o SUPPRESSED  -  Indicates  that you reviewed the finding
                       and do not believe that any action is needed. The find-
                       ing is no longer updated.
