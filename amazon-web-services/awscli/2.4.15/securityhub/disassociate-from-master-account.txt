DISASSOCIATE-FROM-MASTER-ACCOUNT()          DISASSOCIATE-FROM-MASTER-ACCOUNT()



NAME
       disassociate-from-master-account -

DESCRIPTION
       This  method  is  deprecated.  Instead, use DisassociateFromAdministra-
       torAccount .

       The Security Hub console continues to use DisassociateFromMasterAccount
       . It will eventually change to use DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount
       . Any IAM policies that specifically control access  to  this  function
       must  continue  to  use DisassociateFromMasterAccount . You should also
       add DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount to  your  policies  to  ensure
       that  the  correct permissions are in place after the console begins to
       use DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount .

       Disassociates the current Security Hub member account from the  associ-
       ated administrator account.

       This operation is only used by accounts that are not part of an organi-
       zation. For organization accounts, only the administrator  account  can
       disassociate a member account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-from-master-account
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
