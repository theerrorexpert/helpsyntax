GET-INSIGHT-RESULTS()                                    GET-INSIGHT-RESULTS()



NAME
       get-insight-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the results of the Security Hub insight specified by the insight
       ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-insight-results
          --insight-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --insight-arn (string)
          The ARN of the insight for which to return results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the results for an insight

       The following get-insight-results example returns the list  of  insight
       results for the insight with the specified ARN.

          aws securityhub get-insight-results \
              --insight-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"

       Output:

          {
              "InsightResults": {
                  "GroupByAttribute": "ResourceId",
                  "InsightArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "ResultValues": [
                      {
                          "Count": 10,
                          "GroupByAttributeValue": "AWS::::Account:123456789111"
                      },
                      {
                          "Count": 3,
                          "GroupByAttributeValue": "AWS::::Account:123456789222"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }
