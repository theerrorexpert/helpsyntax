GET-ENABLED-STANDARDS()                                GET-ENABLED-STANDARDS()



NAME
       get-enabled-standards -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the standards that are currently enabled.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-enabled-standards  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: StandardsSubscriptions

SYNOPSIS
            get-enabled-standards
          [--standards-subscription-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --standards-subscription-arns (list)
          The list of the standards subscription ARNs  for  the  standards  to
          retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve information about an enabled standard

       The following get-enabled-standards example retrieves information about
       the PCI DSS standard.

          aws securityhub get-enabled-standards \
              --standards-subscription-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"

       Output:

          {
              "StandardsSubscriptions": [
                  {
                      "StandardsArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1::standards/pci-dss/v/3.2.1",
                      "StandardsInput": { },
                      "StandardsStatus": "READY",
                      "StandardsSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       StandardsSubscriptions -> (list)
          The list of StandardsSubscriptions objects that include  information
          about the enabled standards.

          (structure)
              A  resource  that  represents  your  subscription to a supported
              standard.

              StandardsSubscriptionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a resource that represents your subscription to  a
                 supported standard.

              StandardsArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a standard.

              StandardsInput -> (map)
                 A key-value pair of input for the standard.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              StandardsStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the standard subscription.

                 The status values are as follows:

                 o PENDING - Standard is in the process of being enabled.

                 o READY - Standard is enabled.

                 o INCOMPLETE - Standard could not be enabled completely. Some

                 StatusReasonCode -> (string)
                     The reason code that represents the reason for  the  cur-
