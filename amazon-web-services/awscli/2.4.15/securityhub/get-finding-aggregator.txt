GET-FINDING-AGGREGATOR()                              GET-FINDING-AGGREGATOR()



NAME
       get-finding-aggregator -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the current finding aggregation configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-finding-aggregator
          --finding-aggregator-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --finding-aggregator-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the finding aggregator to return details for. To obtain
          the ARN, use ListFindingAggregators .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the current finding aggregation configuration

       The following  get-finding-aggregator  example  retrieves  the  current
       finding aggregation configuration.

          aws securityhub get-finding-aggregator \
              --finding-aggregator-arn arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:222222222222:finding-aggregator/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426652340000

       Output:

          {
              "FindingAggregatorArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:222222222222:finding-aggregator/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426652340000",
              "FindingAggregationRegion": "us-east-1",
              "RegionLinkingMode": "SPECIFIED_REGIONS",
              "Regions": "us-west-1,us-west-2"
          }

       figuration in the AWS Security Hub User Guide.
