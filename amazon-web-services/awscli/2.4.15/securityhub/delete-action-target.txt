DELETE-ACTION-TARGET()                                  DELETE-ACTION-TARGET()



NAME
       delete-action-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a custom action target from Security Hub.

       Deleting  a  custom  action  target  does  not  affect  any findings or
       insights that were already sent to Amazon CloudWatch Events  using  the
       custom action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-action-target
          --action-target-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --action-target-arn (string)
          The ARN of the custom action target to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

              --action-target-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:action/custom/Remediation"

       Output:

          {
              "ActionTargetArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:action/custom/Remediation"
          }

       For more information, see Creating a custom action and  associating  it
       with a CloudWatch Events rule in the AWS Security Hub User Guide.
