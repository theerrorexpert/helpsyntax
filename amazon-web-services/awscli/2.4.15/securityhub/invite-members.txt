INVITE-MEMBERS()                                              INVITE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       invite-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Invites  other  Amazon  Web Services accounts to become member accounts
       for the Security Hub administrator account that the invitation is  sent
       from.

       This operation is only used to invite accounts that do not belong to an
       organization. Organization accounts do not receive invitations.

       Before you can use this action to invite a member, you must  first  use
       the  CreateMembers action to create the member account in Security Hub.

       When the account owner enables Security Hub and accepts the  invitation
       to  become  a  member  account,  the administrator account can view the
       findings generated from the member account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            invite-members
          --account-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The list of account IDs of  the  Amazon  Web  Services  accounts  to
          invite to Security Hub as members.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
