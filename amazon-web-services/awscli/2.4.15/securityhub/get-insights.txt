GET-INSIGHTS()                                                  GET-INSIGHTS()



NAME
       get-insights -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists and describes insights for the specified insight ARNs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-insights is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Insights

SYNOPSIS
            get-insights
          [--insight-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --insight-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the insights to describe. If  you  do  not  provide  any
          insight  ARNs, then GetInsights returns all of your custom insights.
          It does not return any managed insights.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Insights -> (list)
          The insights returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a Security Hub insight.

              InsightArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a Security Hub insight.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of a Security Hub insight.

              Filters -> (structure)
                 One  or  more attributes used to filter the findings included
                 in the insight. The insight only includes findings that match
                 the criteria defined in the filters.

                 ProductArn -> (list)
                     The  ARN  generated by Security Hub that uniquely identi-
                     fies a third-party company (security  findings  provider)
                     after  this  provider's  product (solution that generates
                     findings) is registered with Security Hub.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 AwsAccountId -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID that a finding is gen-
                     erated in.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Id -> (list)
                     The  security findings provider-specific identifier for a
                     finding.

                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 GeneratorId -> (list)
                     The  identifier  for  the  solution-specific component (a
                     discrete unit of logic) that generated a finding. In var-
                     ious security-findings providers' solutions, this genera-
                     tor can be called a rule, a check, a detector, a  plugin,
                     etc.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the

                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter

                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are

                 Type -> (list)
                     A  finding type in the format of namespace/category/clas-
                     sifier that classifies a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Confidence -> (list)
                     A  finding's  confidence.  Confidence  is  defined as the
                     likelihood  that  a  finding  accurately  identifies  the
                     behavior or issue that it was intended to identify.

                     Confidence  is  scored  on  a  0-100  basis using a ratio
                     scale, where 0 means  zero  percent  confidence  and  100
                     means 100 percent confidence.

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)
                            The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The less-than-equal condition to be applied  to  a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The  equal-to  condition to be applied to a single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 Criticality -> (list)
                     The level of importance assigned to the resources associ-
                     ated with the finding.

                     A  score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no
                     criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the  most
                     critical resources.

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)
                            The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The less-than-equal condition to be applied  to  a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The  equal-to  condition to be applied to a single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 Title -> (list)
                     A finding's title.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from

                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 SourceUrl -> (list)
                     A URL that links to a page about the current  finding  in
                     the security-findings provider's solution.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ProductFields -> (list)
                     A data type where security-findings providers can include
                     additional  solution-specific details that aren't part of
                     the defined AwsSecurityFinding format.

                     (structure)
                        A map filter for querying findings.  Each  map  filter
                        provides  the  field  to check, the value to look for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The key  of  the  map  filter.  For  example,  for
                            ResourceTags , Key identifies the name of the tag.
                            For UserDefinedFields , Key is  the  name  of  the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values  for a tag called Department might be Secu-
                            rity . If  you  provide  security  as  the  filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  the  key value when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value,  use EQUALS . For example, for the Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches  findings that have the value Security for
                            the tag Department .

                            To search for values other than the filter  value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field, the filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance
                            matches  findings  that  do  not  have  the  value
                            Finance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS filters on the same field are joined  by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by  AND  . A finding matches only if it matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 ProductName -> (list)
                     The  name  of the solution (product) that generates find-
                     ings.

                     Note that this is  a  filter  against  the  aws/security-
                     hub/ProductName field in ProductFields . It is not a fil-
                     ter for the top-level ProductName field.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 CompanyName -> (list)
                     The name of the findings provider (company) that owns the
                     solution (product) that generates findings.

                     Note that this is  a  filter  against  the  aws/security-
                     hub/CompanyName field in ProductFields . It is not a fil-
                     ter for the top-level CompanyName field.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 UserDefinedFields -> (list)
                     A  list  of  name/value  string pairs associated with the
                     finding. These are custom, user-defined fields added to a
                     finding.

                     (structure)
                        A  map  filter  for querying findings. Each map filter
                        provides the field to check, the value  to  look  for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the  map  filter.  For  example, for
                            ResourceTags , Key identifies the name of the tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to  apply  to  the  key  value  when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value, use EQUALS . For example, for the  Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches findings that have the value Security  for
                            the tag Department .

                            To  search for values other than the filter value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field,  the  filter  Department NOT_EQUALS Finance
                            matches  findings  that  do  not  have  the  value
                            Finance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by AND . A finding matches only if  it  matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You  cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 MalwareName -> (list)
                     The name of the malware that was observed.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 MalwareType -> (list)
                     The type of the malware that was observed.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 MalwarePath -> (list)
                     The filesystem path of the malware that was observed.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security

                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 NetworkProtocol -> (list)
                     The protocol of network-related information about a find-

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 NetworkSourceMac -> (list)
                     The source media access control  (MAC)  address  of  net-
                     work-related information about a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The less-than-equal condition to be applied  to  a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The  equal-to  condition to be applied to a single

                 NetworkDestinationDomain -> (list)
                     The destination  domain  of  network-related  information
                     about a finding.

                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case

                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ProcessPath -> (list)
                     The path to the process executable.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorValue -> (list)
                     The value of a threat intelligence indicator.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorCategory -> (list)
                     The category of a threat intelligence indicator.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the

                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,

                              matches findings that have a resource type other

                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorSourceUrl -> (list)
                     The  URL  for  more details from the source of the threat
                     intelligence.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-

                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceType -> (list)
                     Specifies  the type of the resource that details are pro-

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case

                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when

                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourcePartition -> (list)
                     The canonical Amazon Web Services partition name that the
                     Region is assigned to.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceRegion -> (list)
                     The canonical Amazon Web Services  external  Region  name
                     where this resource is located.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-

                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the

                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-

                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource

                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceTags -> (list)
                     A list of Amazon Web  Services  tags  associated  with  a
                     resource at the time the finding was processed.

                     (structure)
                        A  map  filter  for querying findings. Each map filter
                        provides the field to check, the value  to  look  for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the  map  filter.  For  example, for
                            ResourceTags , Key identifies the name of the tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to  apply  to  the  key  value  when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value, use EQUALS . For example, for the  Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches findings that have the value Security  for
                            the tag Department .

                            To  search for values other than the filter value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field,  the  filter  Department NOT_EQUALS Finance
                            matches  findings  that  do  not  have  the  value
                            Finance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by AND . A finding matches only if  it  matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You  cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)
                     The instance type of the instance.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceImageId -> (list)
                     The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding

                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceIamInstanceProfileArn -> (list)
                     The IAM profile ARN of the instance.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceVpcId -> (list)
                     The identifier of the VPC that the instance was  launched
                     in.

                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)

                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceLaunchedAt -> (list)
                     The date and time the instance was launched.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A start date for the date filter.

                        End -> (string)
                            An end date for the date filter.

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerId -> (list)
                     The canonical user ID of the owner of the S3 bucket.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerName -> (list)
                     The display name of the owner of the S3 bucket.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-

                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the

                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource

                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyPrincipalName -> (list)
                     The name of the principal that is associated with an  IAM
                     access key.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                 ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyStatus -> (list)
                     The status of the IAM access key related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the

                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are

                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceContainerName -> (list)
                     The name of the container related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceContainerImageId -> (list)
                     The identifier of the image related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the

                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-

                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)
                     The date/time that the container was started.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A start date for the date filter.

                        End -> (string)
                            An end date for the date filter.

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
                     The details of a resource that doesn't  have  a  specific
                     subfield for the resource type defined.

                     (structure)
                        A  map  filter  for querying findings. Each map filter
                        provides the field to check, the value  to  look  for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the  map  filter.  For  example, for
                            ResourceTags , Key identifies the name of the tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to  apply  to  the  key  value  when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value, use EQUALS . For example, for the  Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches findings that have the value Security  for
                            the tag Department .

                            To  search for values other than the filter value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field,  the  filter  Department NOT_EQUALS Finance
                            matches  findings  that  do  not  have  the  value
                            Finance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by AND . A finding matches only if  it  matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You  cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 ComplianceStatus -> (list)
                     Exclusive to findings that are generated as the result of
                     a  check run against a specific rule in a supported stan-
                     dard, such as CIS Amazon Web Services  Foundations.  Con-
                     tains security standard-related finding details.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 VerificationState -> (list)
                     The veracity of a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 WorkflowState -> (list)
                     The workflow state of a finding.

                     Note that this field is deprecated. To search for a find-
                     ing based on its workflow status, use WorkflowStatus .

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 WorkflowStatus -> (list)
                     The  status  of the investigation into a finding. Allowed
                     values are the following.

                     o NEW - The initial state of  a  finding,  before  it  is
                       reviewed.  Security Hub also resets the workflow status
                       from NOTIFIED or  RESOLVED  to  NEW  in  the  following
                       cases:

                       o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                       o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to either WARN-
                         ING , FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     o NOTIFIED - Indicates that the resource owner  has  been
                       notified  about  the security issue. Used when the ini-
                       tial reviewer is not  the  resource  owner,  and  needs
                       intervention  from  the  resource  owner. If one of the
                       following occurs, the workflow status is changed  auto-
                       matically from NOTIFIED to NEW :

                       o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                       o Compliance.Status  changes  from  PASSED  to FAILED ,
                         WARNING , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you  reviewed  the  finding
                       and do not believe that any action is needed. The work-
                       flow status of a SUPPRESSED finding does not change  if
                       RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                     o RESOLVED  - The finding was reviewed and remediated and
                       is  now  considered  resolved.   The  finding   remains
                       RESOLVED unless one of the following occurs:

                       o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                       o Compliance.Status  changes  from  PASSED  to FAILED ,
                         WARNING , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     In those cases,  the  workflow  status  is  automatically
                     reset to NEW .

                     For  findings  from  controls,  if  Compliance.Status  is
                     PASSED , then Security Hub automatically sets  the  work-
                     flow status to RESOLVED .

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 RecordState -> (list)
                     The updated record state for the finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that

                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 RelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
                     The ARN of the solution that generated a related finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
                     The timestamp of when the note was updated.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A start date for the date filter.

                        End -> (string)
                            An end date for the date filter.

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
                     The principal that created a note.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Keyword -> (list)
                     A keyword for a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A keyword filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            A value for the keyword.

                 FindingProviderFieldsConfidence -> (list)
                     The  finding  provider  value for the finding confidence.
                     Confidence is defined as the likelihood  that  a  finding
                     accurately  identifies  the behavior or issue that it was
                     intended to identify.

                     Confidence is scored on  a  0-100  basis  using  a  ratio
                     scale,  where  0  means  zero  percent confidence and 100
                     means 100 percent confidence.

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)
                            The greater-than-equal condition to be applied  to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 FindingProviderFieldsCriticality -> (list)
                     The  finding  provider  value for the level of importance
                     assigned to the resources associated with the findings.

                     A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have  no
                     criticality,  and a score of 100 is reserved for the most
                     critical resources.

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                            The greater-than-equal condition to be applied  to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsId -> (list)
                     The finding identifier of a related finding that is iden-
                     tified by the finding provider.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-

                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
                     The  ARN of the solution that generated a related finding
                     that is identified by the finding provider.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX  .  For  example,  the  filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                 FindingProviderFieldsSeverityLabel -> (list)
                     The finding provider value for the severity label.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the

                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security Hub first processes the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then  the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 FindingProviderFieldsTypes -> (list)
                     One  or  more  finding  types  that  the finding provider
                     assigned to  the  finding.  Uses  the  format  of  names-
                     pace/category/classifier that classify a finding.

                     Valid  namespace  values  are: Software and Configuration
                     Checks | TTPs | Effects | Unusual Behaviors  |  Sensitive
                     Data Identifications

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter
                              ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for  the  same  field.
                            Security  Hub  first processes the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Sample -> (list)
                     Indicates whether or not sample findings are included  in
                     the filter results.

                     (structure)
                        Boolean filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (boolean)
                            The value of the boolean.

              GroupByAttribute -> (string)
                 The  grouping attribute for the insight's findings. Indicates
                 how to group the matching findings, and identifies  the  type
                 of  item  that  the  insight  applies  to. For example, if an
                 insight is grouped by resource identifier, then  the  insight
                 produces a list of resource identifiers.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to request the next page of results.
