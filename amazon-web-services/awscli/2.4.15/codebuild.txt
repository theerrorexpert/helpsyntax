CODEBUILD()                                                        CODEBUILD()



NAME
       codebuild -

DESCRIPTION
       CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild com-
       piles your source code, runs unit tests, and  produces  artifacts  that
       are  ready  to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, man-
       age, and scale your own build servers. It  provides  prepackaged  build
       environments  for  the  most  popular  programming  languages and build
       tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully  cus-
       tomize  build  environments  in  CodeBuild to use your own build tools.
       CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak  build  requests.  You  pay
       only  for  the build time you consume. For more information about Code-
       Build, see the * CodeBuild User Guide .*
