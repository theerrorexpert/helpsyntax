GET-DEVICE-REGISTRATION()                            GET-DEVICE-REGISTRATION()



NAME
       get-device-registration -

DESCRIPTION
       Use to check if a device is registered with SageMaker Edge Manager.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-device-registration
          --device-name <value>
          --device-fleet-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-name (string)
          The  unique name of the device you want to get the registration sta-
          tus from.

       --device-fleet-name (string)
          The name of the fleet that the device belongs to.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DeviceRegistration -> (string)
          Describes if the device is currently registered with SageMaker  Edge
          Manager.

       CacheTTL -> (string)
          The  amount  of  time,  in  seconds, that the registration status is
          stored on the devices cache before it is refreshed.
