          --name <value>
          --type <value>
          --delivery-address <value>

          [--idempotency-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --contact-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the contact  you  are  adding  the
          contact channel to.

       --name (string)
          The name of the contact channel.

       --type (string)
          Incident Manager supports three types of contact channels:

          o SMS

          o VOICE

          o EMAIL

          Possible values:

          o SMS

          o VOICE

          o EMAIL

       --delivery-address (structure)
          The  details  that  Incident  Manager uses when trying to engage the
          contact channel. The format is dependent on the type of the  contact
          channel. The following are the expected formats:

          o SMS - '+' followed by the country code and phone number

          o VOICE - '+' followed by the country code and phone number

          o EMAIL - any standard email format

          SimpleAddress -> (string)
              The  format is dependent on the type of the contact channel. The
              following are the expected formats:

              o SMS - '+' followed by the country code and phone number

              o VOICE - '+' followed by the country code and phone number

              o EMAIL - any standard email format

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SimpleAddress=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SimpleAddress": "string"
          }

       --defer-activation | --no-defer-activation (boolean)
          If you want to activate the channel at a later time, you can  choose
          to  defer  activation.  Incident  Manager  can't engage your contact
          channel until it has been activated.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the operation is called  only  once  with  the
          specified details.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
