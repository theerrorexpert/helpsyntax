DELETE-CONTACT()                                              DELETE-CONTACT()



NAME
       delete-contact -

DESCRIPTION
       To  remove a contact from Incident Manager, you can delete the contact.
       Deleting a contact removes them from all escalation plans  and  related
       response plans. Deleting an escalation plan removes it from all related
       response plans. You will have to recreate the contact and  its  contact
       channels before you can use it again.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-contact
          --contact-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --contact-id (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the contact that you're deleting.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a contact

       The following delete-contact example deletes  a  contact.  The  contact
       will  no  longer  be  reachable from any escalation plan that refers to
       them.

          aws ssm-contacts delete-contact \
              --contact-id "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-1:111122223333:contact/alejr"

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Contacts in the Incident Manager User  Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
