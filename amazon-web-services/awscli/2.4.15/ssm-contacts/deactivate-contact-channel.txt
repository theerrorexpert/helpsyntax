NAME
       deactivate-contact-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       To no longer receive Incident Manager engagements to a contact channel,
       you can deactivate the channel.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deactivate-contact-channel
          --contact-channel-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --contact-channel-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the contact channel you're deacti-
          vating.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To deactivate a contact channel

       The  following deactivate-contact-channel example deactivates a contact
       channel. Deactivating a contact channel means the contact channel  will
       no  longer  be paged during an incident. You can also reactivate a con-
       tact channel at any time using the activate-contact-channel command.

          aws ssm-contacts deactivate-contact-channel \
              --contact-channel-id "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:contact-channel/akuam/fc7405c4-46b2-48b7-87b2-93e2f225b90d"

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Contacts in the Incident Manager User  Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
