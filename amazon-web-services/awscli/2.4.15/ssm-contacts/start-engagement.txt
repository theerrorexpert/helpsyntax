          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --contact-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the contact being engaged.

       --sender (string)
          The user that started the engagement.

       --subject (string)
          The secure subject of the message that was sent to the contact.  Use
          this field for engagements to VOICE or EMAIL .

       --content (string)
          The  secure content of the message that was sent to the contact. Use
          this field for engagements to VOICE or EMAIL .

       --public-subject (string)
          The insecure subject of the message that was sent  to  the  contact.
          Use this field for engagements to SMS .

       --public-content (string)
          The  insecure  content  of the message that was sent to the contact.
          Use this field for engagements to SMS .

       --incident-id (string)
          The ARN of the incident that the engagement is part of.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the operation is called  only  once  with  the
          specified details.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To page a contact's contact channels

       The   following  start-engagement  pages  contact's  contact  channels.
       Sender, subject, public-subject, and public-content are all  free  from
       fields.  Incident Manager sends the subject and content to the provided
       VOICE or EMAIL contact channels. Incident Manager sends the public-sub-
       ject and public-content to the provided SMS contact channels. Sender is
       used to track who started the engagement.

          aws ssm-contacts start-engagement \
              --contact-id  "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:contact/akuam" \
              --sender "cli" \
              --subject "cli-test" \
              --content "Testing engagements via CLI" \
              --public-subject "cli-test" \
              --public-content "Testing engagements va CLI"

       Output:

          {
              "EngagementArn": "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:engagement/akuam/607ced0e-e8fa-4ea7-8958-a237b8803f8f"
          }

       Example 2: To page a contact in the provided escalation plan.

       The  following start-engagement engages contact's through an escalation
       plan. Each contact is paged according to their engagement plan.

              --contact-id  "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:contact/example_escalation" \
              --sender "cli" \
              --subject "cli-test" \
              --content "Testing engagements via CLI" \
              --public-subject "cli-test" \
              --public-content "Testing engagements va CLI"
