          first Region of your replication set.

          (structure)
              A container of a key-value name pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 Name of the object key.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"

          ]

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the operation is called  only  once  with  the
          specified details.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a contact

       The following create-contact example creates a contact in your environ-
       ment with a blank plan. The plan can be updated after creating  contact
       channels. Use the create-contact-channel command with the output ARN of
       this command. After you have created contact channels for this  contact
       use update-contact to update the plan.

          aws ssm-contacts create-contact \
              --alias "akuam" \
              --display-name "Akua Mansa" \
              --type PERSONAL \
              --plan '{"Stages": []}'

       Output:

          {
              "ContactArn": "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:contact/akuam"
          }

       For  more information, see Contacts in the Incident Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ContactArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the created contact or  escalation
          plan.
