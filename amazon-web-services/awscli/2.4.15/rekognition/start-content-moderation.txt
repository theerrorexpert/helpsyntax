START-CONTENT-MODERATION()                          START-CONTENT-MODERATION()



NAME
       start-content-moderation -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  asynchronous detection of inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive
       content in a stored video. For a list of moderation  labels  in  Amazon
       Rekognition, see Using the image and video moderation APIs .

       Amazon  Rekognition  Video can moderate content in a video stored in an
       Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name and  the  file-
       name  of  the  video.  StartContentModeration  returns a job identifier
       (JobId ) which you use to get the results of the analysis. When content
       analysis  is  finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion
       status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify
       in NotificationChannel .

       To get the results of the content analysis, first check that the status
       value published to the Amazon SNS topic is  SUCCEEDED  .  If  so,  call
       GetContentModeration and pass the job identifier (JobId ) from the ini-
       tial call to StartContentModeration .

       For more information, see Content moderation in the Amazon  Rekognition
       Developer Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            start-content-moderation
          --video <value>
          [--min-confidence <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video  in  which you want to detect inappropriate, unwanted, or
          offensive content. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3  bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the  bucket  is  versioning  enabled, you can specify the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --min-confidence (float)
          Specifies the minimum confidence that Amazon Rekognition  must  have
          in  order to return a moderated content label. Confidence represents
          how certain Amazon Rekognition is that the moderated content is cor-
          rectly  identified.  0  is the lowest confidence. 100 is the highest
          confidence. Amazon Rekognition doesn't return any moderated  content
          labels  with  a confidence level lower than this specified value. If
          you  don't  specify  MinConfidence  ,  GetContentModeration  returns
          labels with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent  token used to identify the start request. If you use the
          same token with multiple StartContentModeration requests,  the  same
          JobId  is  returned.  Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job
          from being accidently started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The Amazon SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Rekognition  Video  to
          publish the completion status of the content analysis to. The Amazon
          SNS topic must have a topic name that begins with  AmazonRekognition
          if you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole permissions policy
          to access the topic.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition  to  posts  the
              completion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion  notifi-
          cation  that's  published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service
          topic. For example, you can use JobTag to  group  related  jobs  and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start the recognition of unsafe content in a stored video

       The  following  start-content-moderation command starts a job to detect
       unsafe content in the specified video  file  stored  in  an  Amazon  S3
       bucket.

          aws rekognition start-content-moderation \
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       For  more information, see Detecting Unsafe Stored Videos in the Amazon
       Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The identifier for the content analysis job. Use JobId  to  identify
          the job in a subsequent call to GetContentModeration .
