START-FACE-SEARCH()                                        START-FACE-SEARCH()



NAME
       start-face-search -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the asynchronous search for faces in a collection that match the
       faces of persons detected in a stored video.

       The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to  specify
       the  bucket name and the filename of the video. StartFaceSearch returns
       a job identifier (JobId ) which you use to get the search results  once
       the  search  has completed. When searching is finished, Amazon Rekogni-
       tion Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notifica-
       tion Service topic that you specify in NotificationChannel . To get the
       search results, first check that the status value published to the Ama-
       zon  SNS  topic  is SUCCEEDED . If so, call  GetFaceSearch and pass the
       job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartFaceSearch .  For
       more information, see  procedure-person-search-videos .

SYNOPSIS
            start-face-search
          --video <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--face-match-threshold <value>]
          --collection-id <value>
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video you want to search. The video must be stored in an Amazon
          S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning  enabled,  you  can  specify  the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent  token used to identify the start request. If you use the
          same token with multiple StartFaceSearch requests, the same JobId is
          returned.  Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from being
          accidently started more than once.

       --face-match-threshold (float)
          The minimum confidence in the person match to return.  For  example,
          don't  return  any  matches where confidence in matches is less than
          70%. The default value is 80%.

       --collection-id (string)
          ID of the collection that contains the faces you want to search for.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to which you want Amazon Rekognition
          Video to publish the completion status of the search. The Amazon SNS
          topic  must  have a topic name that begins with AmazonRekognition if
          you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole permissions policy to
          access the topic.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  SNS  topic to which Amazon Rekognition to posts the
              completion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition  publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notifi-
          cation that's published to your Amazon Simple  Notification  Service
          topic.  For  example,  you  can use JobTag to group related jobs and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To search for faces in a collection that  match  faces  detected  in  a
       video

       The  following  start-face-search  command  starts  a job to search for
       faces in a collection that match faces detected in the specified  video
       file in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          aws rekognition start-face-search \
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}" \
              --collection-id collection

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       For more information, see Searching Stored Videos for Faces in the Ama-
       zon Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The identifier for the search job. Use JobId to identify the job  in
          a subsequent call to GetFaceSearch .
