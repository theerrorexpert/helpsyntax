GET-FACE-DETECTION()                                      GET-FACE-DETECTION()



NAME
       get-face-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  face  detection  results  for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis
       started by  StartFaceDetection .

       Face detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous  opera-
       tion.  You  start  face  detection by calling  StartFaceDetection which
       returns a job identifier (JobId ). When the  face  detection  operation
       finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the
       Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call
       to StartFaceDetection . To get the results of the face detection opera-
       tion, first check that the status value published  to  the  Amazon  SNS
       topic  is  SUCCEEDED  .  If so, call  GetFaceDetection and pass the job
       identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartFaceDetection .
          GetFaceDetection returns an array of detected faces (Faces )  sorted
          by the time the faces were detected.

       Use  MaxResults  parameter  to  limit the number of labels returned. If
       there are more results than specified in  MaxResults  ,  the  value  of
       NextToken  in  the  operation  response contains a pagination token for
       getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results,  call
       GetFaceDetection  and populate the NextToken request parameter with the
       token value returned from the previous call to GetFaceDetection .

SYNOPSIS
            get-face-detection
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Unique identifier for the face detection job. The JobId is  returned
          from StartFaceDetection .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value  greater  than
          1000,  a  maximum  of 1000 results is returned. The default value is
          1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was  incomplete  (because  there  are  more
          faces  to  retrieve),  Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination
          token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve
          the next set of faces.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the results of a face detection operation

       The following get-face-detection command displays the results of a face
       detection  operation   that   you   started   previously   by   calling
       start-face-detection.

                     only making a determination of the physical appearance of
                     a person's face. It is not a determination of the persons
                     internal emotional state and should not be used in such a
                     way. For example, a person pretending to have a sad  face

                        is only making a determination of the physical appear-
                        ance of a person's face. It is not a determination  of
                        the persons internal emotional state and should not be
                        used in such a way. For example, a  person  pretending
                        to have a sad face might not be sad emotionally.

                        Type -> (string)

                     attribute.

                     (structure)
                        Indicates the location of the landmark on the face.

                            Type of landmark.

                        X -> (float)
                            The x-coordinate of the landmark  expressed  as  a
                            ratio  of the width of the image. The x-coordinate
                            is measured from the left-side of the  image.  For
                            example,  if  the image is 700 pixels wide and the
                            x-coordinate of the landmark  is  at  350  pixels,
                            this value is 0.5.

                        Y -> (float)

                            is  measured  from the top of the image. For exam-
                            ple, if the image height is  200  pixels  and  the
                            y-coordinate of the landmark is at 50 pixels, this
                            value is 0.25.

                 Pose -> (structure)
                     Indicates the pose of  the  face  as  determined  by  its
                     pitch, roll, and yaw. Default attribute.

                     Roll -> (float)
                        Value representing the face rotation on the roll axis.

                     Yaw -> (float)
                        Value representing the face rotation on the yaw  axis.

                     Brightness -> (float)
                        Value representing brightness of the face. The service
                        returns a value  between  0  and  100  (inclusive).  A
                        higher value indicates a brighter face image.

                     Sharpness -> (float)
                        Value  representing sharpness of the face. The service
                        returns a value  between  0  and  100  (inclusive).  A
                        higher value indicates a sharper face image.

                 Confidence -> (float)
                     Confidence  level  that  the bounding box contains a face
                     (and not a different object  such  as  a  tree).  Default
