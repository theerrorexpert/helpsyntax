GET-SEGMENT-DETECTION()                                GET-SEGMENT-DETECTION()



NAME
       get-segment-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the segment detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analy-
       sis started by  StartSegmentDetection .

       Segment detection with Amazon  Rekognition  Video  is  an  asynchronous
       operation.  You  start segment detection by calling  StartSegmentDetec-
       tion which returns a job identifier (JobId ). When the  segment  detec-
       tion operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion sta-
       tus to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered  in  the
       initial  call to StartSegmentDetection . To get the results of the seg-
       ment detection operation, first check that the status  value  published
       to  the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . if so, call GetSegmentDetection
       and pass the job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call of StartSeg-
       mentDetection .
          GetSegmentDetection  returns detected segments in an array (Segments
          ) of  SegmentDetection objects. Segments is sorted  by  the  segment
          types specified in the SegmentTypes input parameter of StartSegment-
          Detection . Each element of the array includes the detected segment,
          the  precentage  confidence  in the acuracy of the detected segment,
          the type of the segment, and the frame  in  which  the  segment  was
          detected.

       Use  SelectedSegmentTypes  to  find  out  the type of segment detection
       requested in the call to StartSegmentDetection .

       Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of segment  detections
       returned.  If there are more results than specified in MaxResults , the
       value of NextToken in the  operation  response  contains  a  pagination
       token  for  getting  the  next  set of results. To get the next page of
       results, call GetSegmentDetection and populate  the  NextToken  request
       parameter  with the token value returned from the previous call to Get-
       SegmentDetection .

       the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            get-segment-detection
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Job  identifier  for the text detection operation for which you want
          results returned. You get the job identifer from an initial call  to
          StartSegmentDetection .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Rekognition Video returns  this
          token  that  you  can  use in the subsequent request to retrieve the
          next set of text.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
