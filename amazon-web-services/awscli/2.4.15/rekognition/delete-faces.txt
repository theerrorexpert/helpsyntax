DELETE-FACES()                                                  DELETE-FACES()



NAME
       delete-faces -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  faces  from  a  collection. You specify a collection ID and an
       array of face IDs to remove from the collection.

       This operation requires permissions to perform the  rekognition:Delete-
       Faces action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-faces
          --collection-id <value>
          --face-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --collection-id (string)
          Collection from which to remove the specific faces.

       --face-ids (list)
          An array of face IDs to delete.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete faces from a collection

       The  following  delete-faces  command deletes the specified face from a
       collection.

              --face-ids '["0040279c-0178-436e-b70a-e61b074e96b0"]'

       Output:

          {
              "DeletedFaces": [
                  "0040279c-0178-436e-b70a-e61b074e96b0"
              ]
