GET-TEXT-DETECTION()                                      GET-TEXT-DETECTION()



NAME
       get-text-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the text detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis
       started by  StartTextDetection .

       Text detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous  opera-
       tion.  You  start  text  detection by calling  StartTextDetection which
       returns a job identifier (JobId ) When  the  text  detection  operation
       finishes,  Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Ama-
       zon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to
       StartTextDetection  .  To  get the results of the text detection opera-
       tion, first check that the status value published  to  the  Amazon  SNS
       topic  is  SUCCEEDED  .  if  so, call GetTextDetection and pass the job
       identifier (JobId ) from the initial call of StartLabelDetection .
          GetTextDetection returns an array of detected text (TextDetections )
          sorted  by  the time the text was detected, up to 50 words per frame
          of video.

       Each element of the array includes the detected  text,  the  precentage
       confidence  in  the acuracy of the detected text, the time the text was
       detected, bounding box information for where the text was located,  and
       unique identifiers for words and their lines.

       Use  MaxResults  parameter  to  limit  the  number  of  text detections
       returned. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults ,  the
       value  of  NextToken  in  the  operation response contains a pagination
       token for getting the next set of results. To  get  the  next  page  of
       results,  call  GetTextDetection  and  populate  the  NextToken request
       parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to  Get-
       TextDetection .

SYNOPSIS
            get-text-detection
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Job  identifier  for the text detection operation for which you want
          results returned. You get the job identifer from an initial call  to
          StartTextDetection .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was  incomplete  (because  there  are  more
          labels  to  retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination
          token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve
          the next set of text.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     racy of the detected text and the accuracy of the  geome-
                     try points around the detected text.

                 Geometry -> (structure)
                     The  location of the detected text on the image. Includes
                     an axis aligned coarse bounding box surrounding the  text
                     and  a  finer  grain  polygon  for  more accurate spatial
                     information.

                        An axis-aligned coarse representation of the  detected
                        item's location on the image.

                        Width -> (float)

                            overall image width.

                        Top -> (float)
                            Top coordinate of the bounding box as a  ratio  of
                            overall image height.

                     Polygon -> (list)
                        Within the bounding box, a fine-grained polygon around
                        the detected item.

                            overall image size.  For  example,  if  the  input
                            image  is  700x200 and the operation returns X=0.5
                            and Y=0.25, then the  point  is  at  the  (350,50)
                            pixel coordinate on the image.

                            An  array  of Point objects, Polygon , is returned
                            by  DetectText and by  DetectCustomLabels .  Poly-
                            gon  represents  a  fine-grained  polygon around a
                            detected item. For more information, see  Geometry
                            in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

                            X -> (float)
                               The  value of the X coordinate for a point on a
                               Polygon .

                               Polygon .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the response is truncated, Amazon Rekognition Video returns this
          token that you can use in the subsequent  request  to  retrieve  the
          next set of text.

       TextModelVersion -> (string)
          Version  number  of the text detection model that was used to detect
          text.
