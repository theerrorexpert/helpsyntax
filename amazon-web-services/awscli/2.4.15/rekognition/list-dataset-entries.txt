LIST-DATASET-ENTRIES()                                  LIST-DATASET-ENTRIES()



NAME
       list-dataset-entries -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  entries  (images) within a dataset. An entry is a JSON Line
       that contains the information for a single image, including  the  image
       location, assigned labels, and object location bounding boxes. For more
       information, see Creating a manifest file .

       JSON Lines in  the  response  include  information  about  non-terminal
       errors found in the dataset. Non terminal errors are reported in errors
       lists within each JSON Line. The same information is  reported  in  the
       training  and  testing validation result manifests that Amazon Rekogni-
       tion Custom Labels creates during model training.

       You can filter the response in variety of ways, such as choosing  which
       labels  to  return  and  returning  JSON Lines created after a specific
       date.

       This operation requires permissions to  perform  the  rekognition:List-
       DatasetEntries action.

       list-dataset-entries  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DatasetEntries

SYNOPSIS
            list-dataset-entries
          --dataset-arn <value>
          [--contains-labels <value>]
          [--labeled | --no-labeled]
          [--source-ref-contains <value>]
          [--has-errors | --no-has-errors]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the dataset that you want to use.

       --contains-labels (list)
          Specifies  a label filter for the response. The response includes an
          entry only if one or more of the labels in ContainsLabels  exist  in
          the entry.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --labeled | --no-labeled (boolean)
          Specify  true to get only the JSON Lines where the image is labeled.
          Specify false to get only the  JSON  Lines  where  the  image  isn't
          labeled.  If  you don't specify Labeled , ListDatasetEntries returns
          JSON Lines for labeled and unlabeled images.

       --source-ref-contains (string)
          If specified, ListDatasetEntries only returns JSON Lines  where  the
          value  of  SourceRefContains  is  part  of the source-ref field. The
          source-ref field contains the Amazon S3 location of the  image.  You
          can use SouceRefContains for tasks such as getting the JSON Line for
          a single image, or gettting JSON Lines for all images within a  spe-
          cific folder.

       --has-errors | --no-has-errors (boolean)
          Specifies  an  error  filter  for the response. Specify True to only
          include entries that have errors.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DatasetEntries -> (list)
          A list of entries (images) in the dataset.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  previous  response  was  incomplete  (because there is more
          results to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition  Custom  Labels  returns  a
          pagination  token in the response. You can use this pagination token
          to retrieve the next set of results.
