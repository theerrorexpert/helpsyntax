DESCRIBE-PROJECTS()                                        DESCRIBE-PROJECTS()



NAME
       describe-projects -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information about your Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels projects.

       This  operation  requires   permissions   to   perform   the   rekogni-
       tion:DescribeProjects action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-projects  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ProjectDescriptions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-projects
          [--project-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-names (list)
          A list of the projects  that  you  want  Amazon  Rekognition  Custom
          Labels  to  describe.  If  you  don't  specify a value, the response
          includes descriptions for all the projects in your AWS account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProjectDescriptions -> (list)
          A  list  of project descriptions. The list is sorted by the date and
          time the projects are created.

          (structure)
              A description of an Amazon Rekognition  Custom  Labels  project.
              For more information, see  DescribeProjects .

              ProjectArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project.

              CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp for the date and time that the project was
                 created.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the project.

              Datasets -> (list)
                 Information about the  training  and  test  datasets  in  the
                 project.

                 (structure)
                     Summary  information  for  an  Amazon  Rekognition Custom
                     Labels dataset. For  more  information,  see   ProjectDe-
                     scription .

                     CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                        The  Unix  timestamp  for  the  date and time that the
                        dataset was created.

                     DatasetType -> (string)
                        The type of the dataset.

                     DatasetArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the dataset.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The status for the dataset.

                     StatusMessage -> (string)
                        The status message for the dataset.

                     StatusMessageCode -> (string)
                        The status message code for the dataset operation.  If
                        a  service error occurs, try the API call again later.
                        If a client error occurs, check the  input  parameters
                        to the dataset API call that failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  previous  response  was  incomplete  (because there is more
          results to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition  Custom  Labels  returns  a
          pagination  token in the response. You can use this pagination token
          to retrieve the next set of results.
