START-FACE-DETECTION()                                  START-FACE-DETECTION()



NAME
       start-face-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts asynchronous detection of faces in a stored video.

       Amazon  Rekognition Video can detect faces in a video stored in an Ama-
       zon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name and  the  filename
       of the video. StartFaceDetection returns a job identifier (JobId ) that
       you use to get the results of the operation.  When  face  detection  is
       finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the
       Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in  Notifica-
       tionChannel . To get the results of the face detection operation, first
       check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic  is  SUC-
       CEEDED  .  If  so,  call   GetFaceDetection and pass the job identifier
       (JobId ) from the initial call to StartFaceDetection .

       For more information, see Detecting Faces in a Stored Video in the Ama-
       zon Rekognition Developer Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            start-face-detection
          --video <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--face-attributes <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video  in  which  you  want  to detect faces. The video must be
          stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning  enabled,  you  can  specify  the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent  token used to identify the start request. If you use the
          same token with multiple StartFaceDetection requests, the same JobId
          is  returned.  Use  ClientRequestToken  to prevent the same job from
          being accidently started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to which you want Amazon Rekognition
          Video  to publish the completion status of the face detection opera-
          tion. The Amazon SNS topic must have a topic name that  begins  with
          AmazonRekognition  if you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole
          permissions policy.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition  to  posts  the
              completion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --face-attributes (string)
          The face attributes you want returned.
              DEFAULT  -  The  following  subset  of  facial  attributes   are
              returned:  BoundingBox, Confidence, Pose, Quality and Landmarks.

              ALL - All facial attributes are returned.

          Possible values:

          o DEFAULT

          o ALL

       --job-tag (string)
          An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion  notifi-
          cation  that's  published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service
          topic. For example, you can use JobTag to  group  related  jobs  and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detect faces in a video

       The following start-face-detection command starts a job to detect faces
       in the specified video file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          aws rekognition start-face-detection
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       zon Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The identifier for the face detection job. Use JobId to identify the
          job in a subsequent call to GetFaceDetection .
