START-PROJECT-VERSION()                                START-PROJECT-VERSION()



NAME
       start-project-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the running of the version of a model. Starting a model takes a
       while to complete. To  check  the  current  state  of  the  model,  use
       DescribeProjectVersions .

       Once  the  model is running, you can detect custom labels in new images
       by calling  DetectCustomLabels .

       NOTE:
          You are charged for the amount of time that the model is running. To
          stop a running model, call  StopProjectVersion .

       This  operation  requires permissions to perform the rekognition:Start-
       ProjectVersion action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-project-version
          --project-version-arn <value>
          --min-inference-units <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-version-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name(ARN) of the model version that you want  to
          start.

       --min-inference-units (integer)
          The  minimum  number  of  inference units to use. A single inference
          unit represents 1 hour of processing and can support up to 5  Trans-
          action  Pers  Second  (TPS). Use a higher number to increase the TPS
          throughput of your model. You are charged for the number  of  infer-
          ence units that you use.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The current running status of the model.
