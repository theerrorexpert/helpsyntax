CREATE-COLLECTION()                                        CREATE-COLLECTION()



NAME
       create-collection -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a collection in an AWS Region. You can add faces to the collec-
       tion using the  IndexFaces operation.

       For example, you might create collections, one for each of your  appli-
       cation  users.  A user can then index faces using the IndexFaces opera-
       tion and persist results in a specific collection.  Then,  a  user  can
       search the collection for faces in the user-specific container.

       When  you create a collection, it is associated with the latest version
       of the face model version.

       NOTE:
          Collection names are case-sensitive.

       This operation requires permissions to perform the  rekognition:Create-
       Collection action. If you want to tag your collection, you also require
       permission to perform the rekognition:TagResource operation.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-collection
          --collection-id <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --collection-id (string)
          ID for the collection that you are creating.

       --tags (map)
          A set of tags (key-value pairs) that you want to attach to the  col-
          lection.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a collection

       The  following  create-collection command creates a collection with the
       specified name.

          aws rekognition create-collection \
              --collection-id "MyCollection"

       Output:

          {
              "CollectionArn": "aws:rekognition:us-west-2:123456789012:collection/MyCollection",
              "FaceModelVersion": "4.0",
              "StatusCode": 200
          }

       tion Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       StatusCode -> (integer)
          HTTP status code indicating the result of the operation.

       CollectionArn -> (string)
          Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the collection. You can use this to
          manage permissions on your resources.

       FaceModelVersion -> (string)
          Latest face model being used with the collection. For more  informa-
          tion, see Model versioning .
