LIST-COLLECTIONS()                                          LIST-COLLECTIONS()



NAME
       list-collections -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  list of collection IDs in your account. If the result is trun-
       cated, the response also provides a NextToken that you can use  in  the
       subsequent request to fetch the next set of collection IDs.

       For  an  example,  see  Listing  Collections  in the Amazon Rekognition
       Developer Guide.

       This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:ListCol-
       lections action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-collections  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: CollectionIds, FaceModelVersions

SYNOPSIS
            list-collections
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the available collections

       The  following list-collections command lists the available collections
       in the AWS account.

          aws rekognition list-collections

       Output:

          {
              "FaceModelVersions": [
                  "2.0",
                  "3.0",
                  "3.0",
                  "3.0",
                  "4.0",
                  "1.0",
                  "3.0",
                  "4.0",
                  "4.0",
                  "4.0"
              ],
              "CollectionIds": [
                  "MyCollection1",
                  "MyCollection2",
                  "MyCollection3",
                  "MyCollection4",
                  "MyCollection5",
                  "MyCollection6",
                  "MyCollection7",
                  "MyCollection8",
                  "MyCollection9",
                  "MyCollection10"
              ]
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       CollectionIds -> (list)
          An array of collection IDs.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  result is truncated, the response provides a NextToken that
          you can use in the subsequent request to fetch the next set of  col-
          lection IDs.

       FaceModelVersions -> (list)
          Latest  face models being used with the corresponding collections in
          the array. For more information, see Model versioning . For example,
          the value of FaceModelVersions[2] is the version number for the face
          detection model used by the collection in CollectionId[2] .

          (string)
