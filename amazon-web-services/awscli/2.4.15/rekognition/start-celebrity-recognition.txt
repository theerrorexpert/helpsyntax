          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The video in which you want to recognize celebrities. The video must
          be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the  bucket  is  versioning  enabled, you can specify the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",

            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use  the
          same  token  with  multiple  StartCelebrityRecognition requests, the
          same JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent  the  same
          job from being accidently started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The  Amazon  SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Rekognition Video to
          publish the completion status of the celebrity recognition  analysis
          to.  The  Amazon  SNS  topic must have a topic name that begins with
          AmazonRekognition if you are using the  AmazonRekognitionServiceRole
          permissions policy.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  SNS  topic to which Amazon Rekognition to posts the
              completion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition  publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notifi-
          cation that's published to your Amazon Simple  Notification  Service
          topic.  For  example,  you  can use JobTag to group related jobs and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
