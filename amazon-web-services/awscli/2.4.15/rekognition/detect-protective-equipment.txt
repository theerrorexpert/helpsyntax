DETECT-PROTECTIVE-EQUIPMENT()                    DETECT-PROTECTIVE-EQUIPMENT()



NAME
       detect-protective-equipment -

DESCRIPTION
       Detects  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) worn by people detected in
       an image. Amazon Rekognition can detect the following types of PPE.

       o Face cover

       o Hand cover

       o Head cover

       You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as  a  refer-
       ence to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. The image must be either a PNG
       or JPG formatted file.
          DetectProtectiveEquipment detects PPE  worn  by  up  to  15  persons
          detected in an image.

       For  each person detected in the image the API returns an array of body
       parts (face, head, left-hand, right-hand). For each body part, an array
       of detected items of PPE is returned, including an indicator of whether
       or not the PPE covers the body part. The API returns the confidence  it
       has  in each detection (person, PPE, body part and body part coverage).
       It also returns a bounding box ( BoundingBox ) for each detected person
       and each detected item of PPE.

       You  can  optionally  request  a summary of detected PPE items with the
       SummarizationAttributes input parameter. The summary provides the  fol-
       lowing information.

       o The  persons  detected  as  wearing  all of the types of PPE that you
         specify.

       o The persons detected as not wearing all of the  types  PPE  that  you
         specify.

       o The persons detected where PPE adornment could not be determined.

       This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not per-
       sist any data.

       This operation requires permissions to perform the  rekognition:Detect-
       ProtectiveEquipment action.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-protective-equipment
          [--image <value>]
          [--summarization-attributes <value>]
          [--image-bytes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image (structure)
          The  image  in which you want to detect PPE on detected persons. The
          image can be passed as image bytes or you  can  reference  an  image
          stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          To specify a local file use --image-bytes instead.

          Bytes -> (blob)
              Blob of image bytes up to 5 MBs.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              Identifies an S3 object as the image source.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the  bucket  is  versioning  enabled, you can specify the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bytes": blob,
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --summarization-attributes (structure)
          An array of PPE types that you want to summarize.

          MinConfidence -> (float)
              The minimum confidence level for which you want summary informa-
              tion.  The  confidence  level  applies to person detection, body
              part detection, equipment detection,  and  body  part  coverage.
              Amazon  Rekognition  doesn't  return  summary information with a
              confidence than this specified  value.  There  isn't  a  default
              value.

              Specify a MinConfidence value that is between 50-100% as Detect-
              ProtectiveEquipment returns predictions only where the detection
              confidence is between 50% - 100%. If you specify a value that is
              less than 50%, the results are the same specifying  a  value  of
              50%.

          RequiredEquipmentTypes -> (list)
              An  array  of  personal protective equipment types for which you
              want summary information. If a  person  is  detected  wearing  a
              required  requipment  type, the person's ID is added to the Per-
              sonsWithRequiredEquipment array field returned in   ProtectiveE-
              quipmentSummary by DetectProtectiveEquipment .

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MinConfidence=float,RequiredEquipmentTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MinConfidence": float,
            "RequiredEquipmentTypes": ["FACE_COVER"|"HAND_COVER"|"HEAD_COVER", ...]
          }

       --image-bytes (blob)
          The content of the image to be uploaded. To specify the content of a
          local file use the fileb:// prefix. Example: fileb://image.png

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
