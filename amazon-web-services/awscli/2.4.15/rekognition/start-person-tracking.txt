START-PERSON-TRACKING()                                START-PERSON-TRACKING()



NAME
       start-person-tracking -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the asynchronous tracking of a person's path in a stored video.

       Amazon Rekognition Video can track the path of people in a video stored
       in  an  Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name and the
       filename of the video. StartPersonTracking  returns  a  job  identifier
       (JobId  ) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label
       detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status
       to  the  Amazon  Simple  Notification Service topic that you specify in
       NotificationChannel .

       To get the results of the person detection operation, first check  that
       the  status  value  published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . If
       so, call  GetPersonTracking and pass the job identifier (JobId  )  from
       the initial call to StartPersonTracking .

SYNOPSIS
            start-person-tracking
          --video <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video  in  which  you  want to detect people. The video must be
          stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning  enabled,  you  can  specify  the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent  token used to identify the start request. If you use the
          same token with  multiple  StartPersonTracking  requests,  the  same
          JobId  is  returned.  Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job
          from being accidently started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The Amazon SNS topic ARN you want Amazon Rekognition Video  to  pub-
          lish the completion status of the people detection operation to. The
          Amazon SNS topic must have a topic name  that  begins  with  Amazon-
          Rekognition  if  you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole per-
          missions policy.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition  to  posts  the
              completion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion  notifi-
          cation  that's  published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service
          topic. For example, you can use JobTag to  group  related  jobs  and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start the pathing of people in a stored video

       The  following  start-person-tracking command starts a job to track the
       paths that people take in the specified video fiel stored in an  Amazon
       S3 bucket.:

          aws rekognition start-person-tracking \
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  People  Pathing in the Amazon Rekognition
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The identifier for the person detection job. Use JobId  to  identify
          the job in a subsequent call to GetPersonTracking .
