RECOGNIZE-CELEBRITIES()                                RECOGNIZE-CELEBRITIES()



NAME
       recognize-celebrities -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of celebrities recognized in the input image. For more
       information, see Recognizing  Celebrities  in  the  Amazon  Rekognition
       Developer Guide.
          RecognizeCelebrities  returns  the 64 largest faces in the image. It
          lists the recognized celebrities in the CelebrityFaces array and any
          unrecognized faces in the UnrecognizedFaces array. RecognizeCelebri-
          ties doesn't return celebrities whose faces aren't among the largest
          64 faces in the image.

       For each celebrity recognized, RecognizeCelebrities returns a Celebrity
       object. The Celebrity object contains the celebrity name, ID, URL links
       to  additional information, match confidence, and a ComparedFace object
       that you can use to locate the celebrity's face on the image.

       Amazon Rekognition doesn't retain  information  about  which  images  a
       celebrity  has  been  recognized  in.  Your application must store this
       information and use the Celebrity ID property as  a  unique  identifier
       for  the celebrity. If you don't store the celebrity name or additional
       information URLs returned by RecognizeCelebrities , you will  need  the
       ID  to identify the celebrity in a call to the  GetCelebrityInfo opera-
       tion.

       You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or  as  a
       reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to
       call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image  bytes  is  not  sup-
       ported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.

       For  an  example, see Recognizing Celebrities in an Image in the Amazon
       Rekognition Developer Guide.

       This operation requires permissions to perform  the  rekognition:Recog-
       nizeCelebrities operation.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            recognize-celebrities
          [--image <value>]
          [--image-bytes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image (structure)
          The  input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use
          the  AWS  CLI  to  call  Amazon  Rekognition   operations,   passing
          base64-encoded image bytes is not supported.

          If  you  are  using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might
          not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the Bytes  field.
          For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer
          guide.

          To specify a local file use --image-bytes instead.

          Bytes -> (blob)
              Blob of image bytes up to 5 MBs.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              Identifies an S3 object as the image source.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning  enabled,  you  can  specify  the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bytes": blob,
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --image-bytes (blob)
          The content of the image to be uploaded. To specify the content of a
          local file use the fileb:// prefix. Example: fileb://image.png

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To recognize celebrities in an image

       The following recognize-celebrities command recognizes  celebrities  in
       the specified image stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.:

          aws rekognition recognize-celebrities \
              --image "S3Object={Bucket=MyImageS3Bucket,Name=moviestars.jpg}"

                 Left -> (float)
                     Left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall
                     image width.

                 Top -> (float)
                     Top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of  overall
                     image height.

              Confidence -> (float)
                 Level  of confidence that what the bounding box contains is a
                 face.

              Landmarks -> (list)
                 An array of facial landmarks.

                 (structure)
                     Indicates the location of the landmark on the face.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Type of landmark.

                     X -> (float)
                        The x-coordinate of the landmark expressed as a  ratio
                        of  the  width  of the image. The x-coordinate is mea-
                        sured from the left-side of the image. For example, if
                        the  image  is 700 pixels wide and the x-coordinate of
                        the landmark is at 350 pixels, this value is 0.5.

                     Y -> (float)
                        The y-coordinate of the landmark expressed as a  ratio
                        of  the  height of the image. The y-coordinate is mea-
                        sured from the top of the image. For example,  if  the
                        image height is 200 pixels and the y-coordinate of the
                        landmark is at 50 pixels, this value is 0.25.

              Pose -> (structure)
                 Indicates the pose of the face as determined  by  its  pitch,
                 roll, and yaw.

                 Roll -> (float)
                     Value representing the face rotation on the roll axis.

                 Yaw -> (float)
                     Value representing the face rotation on the yaw axis.

                 Pitch -> (float)
                     Value representing the face rotation on the pitch axis.

              Quality -> (structure)
                 Identifies face image brightness and sharpness.

                 Brightness -> (float)
                     Value  representing  brightness  of the face. The service
                     returns a value between 0 and 100 (inclusive).  A  higher
                     value indicates a brighter face image.

                 Sharpness -> (float)
                     Value  representing  sharpness  of  the face. The service
                     returns a value between 0 and 100 (inclusive).  A  higher
                     value indicates a sharper face image.

              Emotions -> (list)
                 The emotions that appear to be expressed on the face, and the
                 confidence level in the determination. Valid  values  include
                 "Happy",   "Sad",  "Angry",  "Confused",  "Disgusted",  "Sur-
                 prised", "Calm", "Unknown", and "Fear".

                 (structure)
                     The emotions that appear to be expressed on the face, and
                     the  confidence  level  in  the determination. The API is
                     only making a determination of the physical appearance of
                     a person's face. It is not a determination of the persons
                     internal emotional state and should not be used in such a
                     way.  For example, a person pretending to have a sad face
                     might not be sad emotionally.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Type of emotion detected.

                     Confidence -> (float)
                        Level of confidence in the determination.

              Smile -> (structure)
                 Indicates whether or not the face is smiling, and the  confi-
                 dence level in the determination.

                 Value -> (boolean)
                     Boolean  value that indicates whether the face is smiling
                     or not.

                 Confidence -> (float)
                     Level of confidence in the determination.

       OrientationCorrection -> (string)

          NOTE:
              Support for estimating image orientation using the the  Orienta-
              tionCorrection  field has ceased as of August 2021. Any returned
              values for this field included in an API response will always be
              NULL.

          The  orientation of the input image (counterclockwise direction). If
          your application displays the image, you can use this value to  cor-
          rect  the  orientation.  The  bounding  box  coordinates returned in
          CelebrityFaces and UnrecognizedFaces represent face locations before
          the image orientation is corrected.

          NOTE:
              If  the  input  image  is  in  .jpeg  format,  it  might contain
              exchangeable image (Exif) metadata  that  includes  the  image's
              orientation.  If  so,  and the Exif metadata for the input image
              populates the orientation field, the value of OrientationCorrec-
              tion  is null. The CelebrityFaces and UnrecognizedFaces bounding
              box coordinates represent face locations after Exif metadata  is
              used  to  correct  the  image orientation. Images in .png format
              don't contain Exif metadata.
