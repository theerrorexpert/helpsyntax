DESCRIBE-PROJECT-VERSIONS()                        DESCRIBE-PROJECT-VERSIONS()



NAME
       describe-project-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  and  describes  the versions of a model in an Amazon Rekognition
       Custom Labels project. You can specify up to 10 model versions in  Pro-
       jectVersionArns  .  If  you don't specify a value, descriptions for all
       model versions in the project are returned.

       This  operation  requires   permissions   to   perform   the   rekogni-
       tion:DescribeProjectVersions action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-project-versions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ProjectVersionDescriptions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-project-versions
          --project-arn <value>
          [--version-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project that contains the mod-
          els you want to describe.

       --version-names (list)
          A list of model version names that you want to describe. You can add
          up to 10 model version names to the list. If  you  don't  specify  a
          value,  all  model descriptions are returned. A version name is part
          of    a     model     (ProjectVersion)     ARN.     For     example,
          my-model.2020-01-21T09.10.15  is  the  version name in the following
          ARN.         arn:aws:rekognition:us-east-1:123456789012:project/get-
          ting-started/version/*my-model.2020-01-21T09.10.15* /1234567890123 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                   S3 object must match the region you use for
                                   Amazon Rekognition operations.

                                   For  Amazon  Rekognition  to  process an S3
                                   object, the user must  have  permission  to
                                   access the S3 object. For more information,

                        test dataset (20%) for the training job. After  train-
                        ing  completes, the test dataset is not stored and the

                 Validation -> (structure)
                     The location of the data validation  manifest.  The  data
                     validation  manifest is created for the test dataset dur-

                            evaluate  a model version. Assets can also contain
                            validation information that you  use  to  debug  a
                            failed model training.

                 F1Score -> (float)
                     The  F1  score  for  the evaluation of all labels. The F1

                     performance  of  the  model  as  a single value. A higher
                     value indicates better precision and recall  performance.
                     A  lower  score indicates that precision, recall, or both
                     are performing poorly.

                     Version -> (string)
                        If  the  bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify
                        the object version.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The identifer for the AWS Key Management Service key (AWS KMS
                 key) that was used to encrypt the model during training.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  previous  response  was  incomplete  (because there is more
          results to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition  Custom  Labels  returns  a
          pagination  token in the response. You can use this pagination token
          to retrieve the next set of results.
