GET-LABEL-DETECTION()                                    GET-LABEL-DETECTION()



NAME
       get-label-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the label detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis
       started by  StartLabelDetection .

       The label detection operation is started by a call to  StartLabelDetec-
       tion  which returns a job identifier (JobId ). When the label detection
       operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to
       the  Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial
       call to StartlabelDetection . To get the results of the label detection
       operation,  first  check  that the status value published to the Amazon
       SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . If so, call  GetLabelDetection  and  pass  the
       job  identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartLabelDetection .
          GetLabelDetection returns an array  of  detected  labels  (Labels  )
          sorted  by  the  time the labels were detected. You can also sort by
          the label name by specifying NAME for the SortBy input parameter.

       The labels returned include the label name, the  percentage  confidence
       in  the  accuracy  of  the  detected  label, and the time the label was
       detected in the video.

       The returned labels also include bounding box  information  for  common
       objects, a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels, and the version of
       the label model used for detection.

       Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number  of  labels  returned.  If
       there  are  more  results  than  specified in MaxResults , the value of
       NextToken in the operation response contains  a  pagination  token  for
       getting  the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call
       GetlabelDetection and populate the NextToken request parameter with the
       token value returned from the previous call to GetLabelDetection .

SYNOPSIS
            get-label-detection
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Job  identifier for the label detection operation for which you want
          results returned. You get the job identifer from an initial call  to
          StartlabelDetection .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value  greater  than
          1000,  a  maximum  of 1000 results is returned. The default value is
          1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was  incomplete  (because  there  are  more
          labels  to  retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination
          token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve
          the next set of labels.

       --sort-by (string)
          Sort  to use for elements in the Labels array. Use TIMESTAMP to sort
          array elements by the time labels are detected. Use NAME  to  alpha-
          betically  group  elements  for  a label together. Within each label
          group, the array element are sorted  by  detection  confidence.  The
          default sort is by TIMESTAMP .

          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o TIMESTAMP

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the results of an objects and scenes detection operation

       The  following  get-label-detection  command displays the results of an
       objects and scenes detection operation that you started  previously  by
       calling start-label-detection.
