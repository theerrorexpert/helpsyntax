START-LABEL-DETECTION()                                START-LABEL-DETECTION()



NAME
       start-label-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video.

       Amazon  Rekognition  Video  can  detect  labels  in a video. Labels are
       instances of real-world entities. This includes  objects  like  flower,
       tree,  and  table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party;
       concepts like landscape, evening, and nature;  and  activities  like  a
       person getting out of a car or a person skiing.

       The  video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify
       the bucket name and the  filename  of  the  video.  StartLabelDetection
       returns  a  job identifier (JobId ) which you use to get the results of
       the operation. When label detection  is  finished,  Amazon  Rekognition
       Video  publishes  a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification
       Service topic that you specify in NotificationChannel .

       To get the results of the label detection operation, first  check  that
       the  status  value  published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . If
       so, call  GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId  )  from
       the initial call to StartLabelDetection .

SYNOPSIS
            start-label-detection
          --video <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--min-confidence <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video  in  which  you  want to detect labels. The video must be
          stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning  enabled,  you  can  specify  the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent  token used to identify the start request. If you use the
          same token with  multiple  StartLabelDetection  requests,  the  same
          JobId  is  returned.  Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job
          from being accidently started more than once.

       --min-confidence (float)
          Specifies the minimum confidence that Amazon Rekognition Video  must
          have  in order to return a detected label. Confidence represents how
          certain Amazon Rekognition is that a label is correctly identified.0
          is  the  lowest  confidence.  100  is the highest confidence. Amazon
          Rekognition Video doesn't return any labels with a confidence  level
          lower than this specified value.

          If  you  don't  specify MinConfidence , the operation returns labels
          with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The Amazon SNS topic ARN you want Amazon Rekognition Video  to  pub-
          lish  the completion status of the label detection operation to. The
          Amazon SNS topic must have a topic name  that  begins  with  Amazon-
          Rekognition  if  you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole per-
          missions policy.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition  to  posts  the
              completion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion  notifi-
          cation  that's  published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service
          topic. For example, you can use JobTag to  group  related  jobs  and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detect objects and scenes in a video

       The  following  start-label-detection  command  starts  a job to detect
       objects and scenes in the specified video file stored in an  Amazon  S3
       bucket.

          aws rekognition start-label-detection \
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Detecting Labels in a Video in the Amazon
       Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The identifier for the label detection job. Use  JobId  to  identify
          the job in a subsequent call to GetLabelDetection .
