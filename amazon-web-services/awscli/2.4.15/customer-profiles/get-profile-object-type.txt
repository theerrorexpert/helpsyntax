NAME
       get-profile-object-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the object types for a specific domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-profile-object-type
          --domain-name <value>
          --object-type-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --object-type-name (string)
          The name of the profile object type.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObjectTypeName -> (string)
          The name of the profile object type.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the profile object type.

       TemplateId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the object template.

       ExpirationDays -> (integer)
          The number of days until the data in the object expires.

       EncryptionKey -> (string)
          The customer-provided key to encrypt the profile object that will be
          created in this profile object type.

       AllowProfileCreation -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether a profile should be created when data is  received
          if one doesnt exist for an object of this type. The default is FALSE
          . If the AllowProfileCreation flag is set to FALSE , then  the  ser-
          vice  tries  to  fetch  a standard profile and associate this object
          with the profile. If it is set to TRUE , and if no match  is  found,
          then the service creates a new standard profile.

       SourceLastUpdatedTimestampFormat -> (string)
          The  format  of  your sourceLastUpdatedTimestamp that was previously
          set up.

       Fields -> (map)
          A map of the name and ObjectType field.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents a field in a ProfileObjectType.

              Source -> (string)
                 A field of a ProfileObject. For  example:  _source.FirstName,
                 where  _source  is  a ProfileObjectType of a Zendesk user and
                 FirstName is a field in that ObjectType.

              Target -> (string)
                 The location of the data in the standard ProfileObject model.
                 For example: _profile.Address.PostalCode.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The  content type of the field. Used for determining equality
                 when searching.

       Keys -> (map)
          A list of unique keys that can be used to map data to the profile.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 An object that defines the Key element of a ProfileObject.  A
                 Key  is  a  special  element that can be used to search for a
                 customer profile.

                 StandardIdentifiers -> (list)
                     The types of keys that a  ProfileObject  can  have.  Each
                     ProfileObject  can  have  only  1 UNIQUE key but multiple
                     PROFILE keys. PROFILE, ASSET, CASE, or ORDER  means  that
                     this  key  can  be  used  to  tie an object to a PROFILE,
                     ASSET, CASE, or ORDER respectively. UNIQUE means that  it
                     can be used to uniquely identify an object. If a key a is
                     marked as SECONDARY, it will be used to search  for  pro-
                     files  after all other PROFILE keys have been searched. A
                     LOOKUP_ONLY key is only used to match a  profile  but  is
                     not  persisted to be used for searching of the profile. A
                     NEW_ONLY key is only used if the profile does not already
                     exist before the object is ingested, otherwise it is only
                     used for matching objects to profiles.

                     (string)

                 FieldNames -> (list)
                     The reference for the key name of the fields map.

                     (string)

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the domain was created.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the domain was most recently edited.

       Tags -> (map)
          The tags used  to  organize,  track,  or  control  access  for  this
          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
