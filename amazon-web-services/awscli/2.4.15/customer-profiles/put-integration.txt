       --object-type-names (map)
          A map in which each key is an event type from an  external  applica-
          tion such as Segment or Shopify, and each value is an ObjectTypeName
          (template) used to ingest the event. It supports the following event
          types:  SegmentIdentify , ShopifyCreateCustomers , ShopifyUpdateCus-
          tomers  ,  ShopifyCreateDraftOrders  ,  ShopifyUpdateDraftOrders   ,
          ShopifyCreateOrders , and ShopifyUpdatedOrders .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
