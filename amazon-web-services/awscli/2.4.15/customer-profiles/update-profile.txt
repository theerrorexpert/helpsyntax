UPDATE-PROFILE()                                              UPDATE-PROFILE()



NAME
       update-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  properties  of  a  profile. The ProfileId is required for
       updating a customer profile.

       When calling the UpdateProfile API, specifying an  empty  string  value
       means  that any existing value will be removed. Not specifying a string
       value means that any value already there will be kept.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       ProfileId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of a customer profile.
