NAME
       list-identity-resolution-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all of the Identity Resolution Jobs in your domain. The response
       sorts the list by JobStartTime .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-identity-resolution-jobs
          --domain-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityResolutionJobsList -> (list)
          A list of Identity Resolution Jobs.

          (structure)
              Information about the Identity Resolution Job.

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The unique name of the domain.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the Identity Resolution Job.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the Identity Resolution Job.

                 o PENDING : The Identity Resolution Job is scheduled but  has
                   not  started  yet.  If you turn off the Identity Resolution
                   feature in your domain,  jobs  in  the  PENDING  state  are
                   deleted.

                 o PREPROCESSING : The Identity Resolution Job is loading your
                   data.

                 o FIND_MATCHING : The Identity Resolution Job  is  using  the
                   machine  learning model to identify profiles that belong to
                   the same matching group.

                 o MERGING : The Identity Resolution Job is merging  duplicate
                   profiles.

                 o COMPLETED  : The Identity Resolution Job completed success-
                   fully.

                 o PARTIAL_SUCCESS : There's a system error and not all of the
                   data  is  merged. The Identity Resolution Job writes a mes-
                   sage indicating the source of the problem.

                 o FAILED : The Identity Resolution  Job  did  not  merge  any
                   data.  It  writes  a  message  indicating the source of the
                   problem.

              JobStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of when the job was started or will be started.

              JobEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of when the job was completed.

              JobStats -> (structure)
                 Statistics about an Identity Resolution Job.

                 NumberOfProfilesReviewed -> (long)
                     The number of profiles reviewed.

                 NumberOfMatchesFound -> (long)
                     The number of matches found.

                 NumberOfMergesDone -> (long)
                     The number of merges completed.

              ExportingLocation -> (structure)
                 The  S3  location  where  the  Identity Resolution Job writes
                 result files.

                 S3Exporting -> (structure)
                     Information about the S3 location where Identity  Resolu-
                     tion Jobs write result files.

                     S3BucketName -> (string)
                        The  name of the S3 bucket name where Identity Resolu-
                        tion Jobs write result files.

                     S3KeyName -> (string)
                        The S3 key name of the location where Identity Resolu-
                        tion Jobs write result files.

              Message -> (string)
                 The error messages that are generated when the Identity Reso-
