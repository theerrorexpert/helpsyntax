MERGE-PROFILES()                                              MERGE-PROFILES()



NAME
       merge-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Runs an AWS Lambda job that does the following:

       o All  the  profileKeys  in  the ProfileToBeMerged will be moved to the
         main profile.

       o All the objects in the ProfileToBeMerged will be moved  to  the  main
         profile.

       o All the ProfileToBeMerged will be deleted at the end.

       o All  the profileKeys in the ProfileIdsToBeMerged will be moved to the
         main profile.

       o Standard fields are merged as follows:

         o Fields are always "union"-ed if there are no conflicts in  standard
           fields or attributeKeys.

         o When there are conflicting fields:

           o If no SourceProfileIds entry is specified, the main Profile value
             is always taken.

           o If a SourceProfileIds entry is specified, the specified profileId
             is always taken, even if it is a NULL value.

       You  can  use  MergeProfiles  together  with GetMatches , which returns
       potentially matching profiles, or use it with the  results  of  another
       matching  system. After profiles have been merged, they cannot be sepa-
       rated (unmerged).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Message -> (string)
          A message that indicates the merge request is complete.
