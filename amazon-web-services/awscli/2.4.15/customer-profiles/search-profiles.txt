OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token from the previous SearchProfiles API call.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects returned per page.

       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --key-name (string)
          A searchable identifier of a customer profile. The  predefined  keys
          you  can  use  to  search  include:  _account, _profileId, _assetId,
          _caseId, _orderId, _fullName, _phone, _email, _ctrContactId, _marke-
          toLeadId, _salesforceAccountId, _salesforceContactId, _salesforceAs-
          setId, _zendeskUserId, _zendeskExternalId, _zendeskTicketId, _servi-
          ceNowSystemId,  _serviceNowIncidentId,  _segmentUserId, _shopifyCus-
          tomerId, _shopifyOrderId.

       --values (list)
          A list of key values.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
