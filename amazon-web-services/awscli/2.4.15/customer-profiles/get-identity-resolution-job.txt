NAME
       get-identity-resolution-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  an  Identity  Resolution Job in a specific
       domain.

       Identity Resolution Jobs are set up using the Amazon Connect admin con-
       sole.  For more information, see Use Identity Resolution to consolidate
       similar profiles .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-identity-resolution-job
          --domain-name <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the Identity Resolution Job.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainName -> (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       JobId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the Identity Resolution Job.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the Identity Resolution Job.

          o PENDING : The Identity Resolution Job is  scheduled  but  has  not
            started  yet.  If  you turn off the Identity Resolution feature in
            your domain, jobs in the PENDING state are deleted.

          o PREPROCESSING : The Identity Resolution Job is loading your  data.

          o FIND_MATCHING  :  The Identity Resolution Job is using the machine
            learning model to identify profiles that belong to the same match-
            ing group.

          o MERGING  :  The  Identity Resolution Job is merging duplicate pro-
            files.

          o COMPLETED : The Identity Resolution Job completed successfully.

          o PARTIAL_SUCCESS : There's a system error and not all of  the  data
            is merged. The Identity Resolution Job writes a message indicating
            the source of the problem.

          o FAILED : The Identity Resolution Job did not merge  any  data.  It
            writes a message indicating the source of the problem.

       Message -> (string)
          The  error  messages that are generated when the Identity Resolution
          Job runs.

       JobStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the Identity Resolution  Job  was  started  or
          will be started.

       JobEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the Identity Resolution Job was completed.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  timestamp of when the Identity Resolution Job was most recently
          edited.

       JobExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the Identity Resolution Job will expire.

       AutoMerging -> (structure)
          Configuration settings for how to perform the auto-merging  of  pro-
          files.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              The flag that enables the auto-merging of duplicate profiles.

          Consolidation -> (structure)
              A  list of matching attributes that represent matching criteria.
              If two profiles meet at least one of  the  requirements  in  the
              matching attributes list, they will be merged.

              MatchingAttributesList -> (list)
                 A list of matching criteria.

                 (list)
                     (string)

          ConflictResolution -> (structure)
              How  the  auto-merging  process should resolve conflicts between
              different profiles. For example, if Profile A and Profile B have
              the same FirstName and LastName (and that is the matching crite-
              ria), which EmailAddress should be used?

              ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
                 How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts between
                 different profiles.

                 o RECENCY : Uses the data that was most recently updated.

                 o SOURCE : Uses the data from a specific source. For example,
                   if a company has  been  aquired  or  two  departments  have
                   merged,  data  from  the  specified  source is used. If two
                   duplicate profiles are from the same source,  then  RECENCY
                   is used again.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The  ObjectType  name that is used to resolve profile merging
                 conflicts when choosing SOURCE as the  ConflictResolvingModel
                 .

       ExportingLocation -> (structure)
          The  S3  location  where  the  Identity Resolution Job writes result
          files.

          S3Exporting -> (structure)
              Information about the S3 location where Identity Resolution Jobs
              write result files.

              S3BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket name where Identity Resolution Jobs
                 write result files.

              S3KeyName -> (string)
                 The S3 key name of the  location  where  Identity  Resolution
                 Jobs write result files.

       JobStats -> (structure)
          Statistics about the Identity Resolution Job.

          NumberOfProfilesReviewed -> (long)
              The number of profiles reviewed.

          NumberOfMatchesFound -> (long)
              The number of matches found.

          NumberOfMergesDone -> (long)
