OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --object-type-name (string)
          The name of the profile object type.

       --description (string)
          Description of the profile object type.

       --template-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the object template.

       --expiration-days (integer)
          The number of days until the data in the object expires.

       --encryption-key (string)
          The customer-provided key to encrypt the profile object that will be
          created in this profile object type.

       --allow-profile-creation | --no-allow-profile-creation (boolean)
          Indicates whether a profile should be created when data is  received
          if one doesnt exist for an object of this type. The default is FALSE
          . If the AllowProfileCreation flag is set to FALSE , then  the  ser-
          vice  tries  to  fetch  a standard profile and associate this object
          with the profile. If it is set to TRUE , and if no match  is  found,
          then the service creates a new standard profile.

       --source-last-updated-timestamp-format (string)
          The  format  of  your sourceLastUpdatedTimestamp that was previously
          set up.

       --fields (map)
          A map of the name and ObjectType field.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents a field in a ProfileObjectType.

              Source -> (string)
                 A field of a ProfileObject. For  example:  _source.FirstName,
                 where  _source  is  a ProfileObjectType of a Zendesk user and
                 FirstName is a field in that ObjectType.

              Target -> (string)
                 The location of the data in the standard ProfileObject model.
                 For example: _profile.Address.PostalCode.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The  content type of the field. Used for determining equality
                 when searching.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=Source=string,Target=string,ContentType=string,KeyName2=Source=string,Target=string,ContentType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "Source": "string",
                "Target": "string",
                "ContentType": "STRING"|"NUMBER"|"PHONE_NUMBER"|"EMAIL_ADDRESS"|"NAME"
              }
            ...}

       --keys (map)
          A list of unique keys that can be used to map data to the profile.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 An object that defines the Key element of a ProfileObject.  A
                 Key  is  a  special  element that can be used to search for a
                 customer profile.

                 StandardIdentifiers -> (list)
                     The types of keys that a  ProfileObject  can  have.  Each
                     ProfileObject  can  have  only  1 UNIQUE key but multiple
                     PROFILE keys. PROFILE, ASSET, CASE, or ORDER  means  that
                     this  key  can  be  used  to  tie an object to a PROFILE,
                     ASSET, CASE, or ORDER respectively. UNIQUE means that  it
                     can be used to uniquely identify an object. If a key a is
                     marked as SECONDARY, it will be used to search  for  pro-
                     files  after all other PROFILE keys have been searched. A
                     LOOKUP_ONLY key is only used to match a  profile  but  is
                     not  persisted to be used for searching of the profile. A
                     NEW_ONLY key is only used if the profile does not already
                     exist before the object is ingested, otherwise it is only
                     used for matching objects to profiles.

                     (string)

                 FieldNames -> (list)
                     The reference for the key name of the fields map.

                     (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=[{StandardIdentifiers=[string,string],FieldNames=[string,string]},{StandardIdentifiers=[string,string],FieldNames=[string,string]}],KeyName2=[{StandardIdentifiers=[string,string],FieldNames=[string,string]},{StandardIdentifiers=[string,string],FieldNames=[string,string]}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": [
                {
                  "StandardIdentifiers": ["PROFILE"|"ASSET"|"CASE"|"UNIQUE"|"SECONDARY"|"LOOKUP_ONLY"|"NEW_ONLY"|"ORDER", ...],
                  "FieldNames": ["string", ...]
                }
                ...
              ]
            ...}

       --tags (map)
          The tags used  to  organize,  track,  or  control  access  for  this
          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
