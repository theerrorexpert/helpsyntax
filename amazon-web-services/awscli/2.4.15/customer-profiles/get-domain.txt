GET-DOMAIN()                                                      GET-DOMAIN()



NAME
       get-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a specific domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainName -> (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       DefaultExpirationDays -> (integer)
          The default number of days until the data within the domain expires.

       DefaultEncryptionKey -> (string)
          The default encryption key, which is an AWS  managed  key,  is  used
          when  no specific type of encryption key is specified. It is used to
          encrypt all data before it is placed in permanent or  semi-permanent
          storage.

       DeadLetterQueueUrl -> (string)
          The  URL  of  the SQS dead letter queue, which is used for reporting
          errors associated with ingesting data from third party applications.

       Stats -> (structure)
          Usage-specific statistics about the domain.

          ProfileCount -> (long)
              The total number of profiles currently in the domain.

          MeteringProfileCount -> (long)
              The  number of profiles that you are currently paying for in the
              domain. If you have more than 100 objects associated with a sin-
              gle  profile,  that  profile counts as two profiles. If you have
              more than 200 objects, that profile counts as three, and so  on.

          ObjectCount -> (long)
              The total number of objects in domain.

          TotalSize -> (long)
              The total size, in bytes, of all objects in the domain.

       Matching -> (structure)
          The  process  of  matching  duplicate profiles. If Matching = true ,
          Amazon Connect Customer  Profiles  starts  a  weekly  batch  process
          called  Identity  Resolution  Job.  If you do not specify a date and
          time for Identity Resolution Job to run, by default  it  runs  every
          Saturday at 12AM UTC to detect duplicate profiles in your domains.

          After  the Identity Resolution Job completes, use the GetMatches API
          to return and review the results. Or, if you have configured Export-
          ingConfig in the MatchingRequest , you can download the results from
          S3.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              The flag that enables the matching  process  of  duplicate  pro-
              files.

          JobSchedule -> (structure)
              The  day and time when do you want to start the Identity Resolu-
              tion Job every week.

              DayOfTheWeek -> (string)
                 The day when the Identity Resolution  Job  should  run  every
                 week.

              Time -> (string)
                 The  time  when  the Identity Resolution Job should run every
                 week.

          AutoMerging -> (structure)
              Configuration information about the auto-merging process.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 The flag that enables the auto-merging of duplicate profiles.

              Consolidation -> (structure)
                 A  list of matching attributes that represent matching crite-
                 ria. If two profiles meet at least one of the requirements in
                 the matching attributes list, they will be merged.

                 MatchingAttributesList -> (list)
                     A list of matching criteria.

                     (list)
                        (string)

              ConflictResolution -> (structure)
                 How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts between
                 different profiles. For example, if Profile A and  Profile  B
                 have  the same FirstName and LastName (and that is the match-
                 ing criteria), which EmailAddress should be used?

                 ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
                     How the auto-merging  process  should  resolve  conflicts
                     between different profiles.

                     o RECENCY : Uses the data that was most recently updated.

                     o SOURCE : Uses the data  from  a  specific  source.  For
                       example,  if  a company has been aquired or two depart-
                       ments have merged, data from the  specified  source  is
                       used.  If  two  duplicate  profiles  are  from the same
                       source, then RECENCY is used again.

                 SourceName -> (string)
                     The ObjectType name that is used to resolve profile merg-
                     ing conflicts when choosing SOURCE as the ConflictResolv-
                     ingModel .

          ExportingConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration  information  for  exporting  Identity  Resolution
              results, for example, to an S3 bucket.

              S3Exporting -> (structure)
                 The  S3  location where Identity Resolution Jobs write result
                 files.

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket where Identity Resolution  Jobs
                     write result files.

                 S3KeyName -> (string)
                     The S3 key name of the location where Identity Resolution
                     Jobs write result files.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the domain was created.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the domain was most recently edited.

       Tags -> (map)
          The tags used  to  organize,  track,  or  control  access  for  this
          resource.
