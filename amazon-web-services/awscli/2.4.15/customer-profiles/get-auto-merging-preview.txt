GET-AUTO-MERGING-PREVIEW()                          GET-AUTO-MERGING-PREVIEW()



NAME
       get-auto-merging-preview -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests the auto-merging settings of your Identity Resolution Job without
       merging your data. It randomly selects a sample of matching groups from
       the  existing  matching  results,  and applies the automerging settings
       that you provided. You can then view the number of profiles in the sam-
       ple, the number of matches, and the number of profiles identified to be
       merged. This enables you to evaluate the accuracy of the attributes  in
       your matching list.

       You can't view which profiles are matched and would be merged.

       WARNING:
          We  strongly  recommend  you  use  this  API  to do a dry run of the
          automerging process before  running  the  Identity  Resolution  Job.
          Include  at  least  two  matching  attributes. If your matching list
          includes too few attributes (such as only FirstName or only LastName
          ),  there  may  be  a  large  number  of matches. This increases the
          chances of erroneous merges.

SYNOPSIS
            get-auto-merging-preview
          --domain-name <value>
          --consolidation <value>
          --conflict-resolution <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --consolidation (structure)
          A list of matching attributes that represent matching criteria.

          MatchingAttributesList -> (list)
              A list of matching criteria.

              (list)
                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MatchingAttributesList=[[string,string],[string,string]]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MatchingAttributesList": [
              ["string", ...]
              ...
            ]
          }

       --conflict-resolution (structure)
          How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts  between  dif-
          ferent profiles.

          ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
              How  the  auto-merging  process should resolve conflicts between
              different profiles.

              o RECENCY : Uses the data that was most recently updated.

              o SOURCE : Uses the data from a specific source. For example, if
                a  company  has  been  aquired or two departments have merged,
                data from the specified source is used. If two duplicate  pro-
                files are from the same source, then RECENCY is used again.

          SourceName -> (string)
              The ObjectType name that is used to resolve profile merging con-
              flicts when choosing SOURCE as the ConflictResolvingModel .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConflictResolvingModel=string,SourceName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConflictResolvingModel": "RECENCY"|"SOURCE",
            "SourceName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainName -> (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       NumberOfMatchesInSample -> (long)
          The number of match groups in the domain that have been reviewed  in
          this preview dry run.

       NumberOfProfilesInSample -> (long)
          The number of profiles found in this preview dry run.

       NumberOfProfilesWillBeMerged -> (long)
          The number of profiles that would be merged if this wasn't a preview
          dry run.
