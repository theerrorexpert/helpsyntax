DESCRIBE-STREAM-SUMMARY()                            DESCRIBE-STREAM-SUMMARY()



NAME
       describe-stream-summary -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a summarized description of the specified Kinesis data stream
       without the shard list.

       The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN), status, record retention period, approximate creation time, mon-
       itoring, encryption details, and open shard count.
          DescribeStreamSummary has a limit of 20 transactions per second  per
          account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stream-summary
          --stream-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a data stream summary

       The  following  describe-stream-summary  example  provides a summarized
       description (without the shard list) of the specified data stream.

          aws kinesis describe-stream-summary \
              --stream-name samplestream

OUTPUT
       StreamDescriptionSummary -> (structure)
          A  StreamDescriptionSummary containing information about the stream.

          StreamName -> (string)
              The name of the stream being described.

          StreamARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream being described.

          StreamStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the stream  being  described.  The  stream
              status is one of the following states:

              o CREATING  -  The stream is being created. Kinesis Data Streams
                immediately returns and sets StreamStatus to CREATING .

              o DELETING - The stream is being deleted. The  specified  stream
                is  in the DELETING state until Kinesis Data Streams completes
                the deletion.

              o ACTIVE - The stream exists and is ready  for  read  and  write
                operations  or  deletion.  You  should  perform read and write
                operations only on an ACTIVE stream.

              o UPDATING - Shards in the stream are  being  merged  or  split.
                Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is
                in the UPDATING state.

          StreamModeDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies the capacity mode to which you want to set  your  data
              stream.  Currently,  in  Kinesis  Data  Streams,  you can choose
              between an on-demand ycapacity mode and a  provisioned  capacity
              mode for your data streams.

              StreamMode -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  capacity  mode  to which you want to set your
                 data stream. Currently, in  Kinesis  Data  Streams,  you  can
                 choose  between  an on-demand capacity mode and a provisioned
                 capacity mode for your data streams.

          RetentionPeriodHours -> (integer)
              The current retention period, in hours.

          StreamCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The approximate time that the stream was created.

          EnhancedMonitoring -> (list)
              Represents the  current  enhanced  monitoring  settings  of  the
              stream.

              (structure)
                 Represents enhanced metrics types.

                 ShardLevelMetrics -> (list)
                     List of shard-level metrics.

                     The  following  are  the  valid  shard-level metrics. The
                     value "ALL " enhances every metric.

                     o IncomingBytes

                     o IncomingRecords

                     o OutgoingBytes

                     o OutgoingRecords

                     o WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded

                     o ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded

                     o IteratorAgeMilliseconds

                     o ALL

                     (string)

          EncryptionType -> (string)
              The encryption type used. This value is one of the following:

              o KMS

              o NONE

          KeyId -> (string)
              The GUID for the customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key to
              use  for encryption. This value can be a globally unique identi-
              fier, a fully specified ARN to either an alias or a key,  or  an
              alias  name  prefixed  by "alias/".You can also use a master key
              owned by Kinesis Data Streams by specifying the alias  aws/kine-
              sis .

              o Key                        ARN                        example:
