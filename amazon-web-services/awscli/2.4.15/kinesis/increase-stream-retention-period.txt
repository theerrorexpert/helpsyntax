INCREASE-STREAM-RETENTION-PERIOD()          INCREASE-STREAM-RETENTION-PERIOD()



NAME
       increase-stream-retention-period -

DESCRIPTION
       Increases  the  Kinesis  data  stream's  retention period, which is the
       length of time data records are accessible after they are added to  the
       stream.  The maximum value of a stream's retention period is 8760 hours
       (365 days).

       If  you  choose  a  longer  stream  retention  period,  this  operation
       increases  the  time  period  during  which  records  that have not yet
       expired are accessible. However, it does  not  make  previous,  expired
       data  (older  than  the  stream's previous retention period) accessible
       after the operation has been called. For example, if a stream's  reten-
       tion  period is set to 24 hours and is increased to 168 hours, any data
       that is older than 24 hours remains inaccessible to  consumer  applica-
       tions.

SYNOPSIS
            increase-stream-retention-period
          --stream-name <value>
          --retention-period-hours <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to modify.

       --retention-period-hours (integer)
          The  new retention period of the stream, in hours. Must be more than
          the current retention period.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To increase data stream retention period

       The following increase-stream-retention-period  example  increases  the
       retention  period (the length of time data records are accessible after
       they are added to the stream) of the specified stream to 168 hours.

          aws kinesis increase-stream-retention-period \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --retention-period-hours 168

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Changing the Data  Retention  Period  in  the
       Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
