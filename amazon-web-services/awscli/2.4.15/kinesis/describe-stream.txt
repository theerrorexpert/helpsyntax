DESCRIBE-STREAM()                                            DESCRIBE-STREAM()



NAME
       describe-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified Kinesis data stream.

       NOTE:
          This  API has been revised. It's highly recommended that you use the
          DescribeStreamSummary API to get a  summarized  description  of  the
          specified  Kinesis  data  stream and the  ListShards API to list the
          shards in a specified data stream and obtain information about  each
          shard.

       The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN), creation time, enhanced metric configuration, and shard map. The
       shard map is an array of shard objects. For each shard object, there is
       the hash key and sequence number ranges that the shard spans,  and  the
       IDs  of any earlier shards that played in a role in creating the shard.
       Every record ingested in the stream is identified by a sequence number,
       which is assigned when the record is put into the stream.

       You  can  limit  the  number  of shards returned by each call. For more
       information, see Retrieving Shards from a Stream in the Amazon  Kinesis
       Data Streams Developer Guide .

       There  are no guarantees about the chronological order shards returned.
       To process shards in chronological order, use  the  ID  of  the  parent
       shard to track the lineage to the oldest shard.

       This operation has a limit of 10 transactions per second per account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-stream  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: StreamDescription.Shards

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stream
          --stream-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StreamDescription -> (structure)
          The  current  status  of the stream, the stream Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN), an array of shard  objects  that  comprise  the  stream,  and
          whether there are more shards available.

          StreamName -> (string)
              The name of the stream being described.

          StreamARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream being described.

          StreamStatus -> (string)
              The  current  status  of  the stream being described. The stream
              status is one of the following states:

              o CREATING - The stream is being created. Kinesis  Data  Streams
                immediately returns and sets StreamStatus to CREATING .

              o DELETING  -  The stream is being deleted. The specified stream
                is in the DELETING state until Kinesis Data Streams  completes
                the deletion.

              o ACTIVE  -  The  stream  exists and is ready for read and write
                operations or deletion. You  should  perform  read  and  write
                operations only on an ACTIVE stream.

              o UPDATING  -  Shards  in  the stream are being merged or split.
                Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is
                in the UPDATING state.

          StreamModeDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  capacity mode to which you want to set your data
              stream. Currently, in  Kinesis  Data  Streams,  you  can  choose
              between  an  on-demand  capacity mode and a provisioned capacity
              mode for your data streams.

              StreamMode -> (string)
                 Specifies the capacity mode to which you  want  to  set  your
                 data  stream.  Currently,  in  Kinesis  Data Streams, you can
                 choose between an on-demand capacity mode and  a  provisioned
                 capacity mode for your data streams.

                 HashKeyRange -> (structure)
                     The  range  of  possible  hash  key values for the shard,
                     which is a set of ordered contiguous positive integers.

                     StartingHashKey -> (string)
                        The starting hash key of the hash key range.

                     EndingHashKey -> (string)
                        The ending hash key of the hash key range.

                 SequenceNumberRange -> (structure)

                     EndingSequenceNumber -> (string)
                        The ending sequence number for the range. Shards  that
                        are  in  the OPEN state have an ending sequence number
                        of null .

          HasMoreShards -> (boolean)
              If set to true , more shards in  the  stream  are  available  to
              describe.

          RetentionPeriodHours -> (integer)
              The  current  retention  period,  in hours. Minimum value of 24.

          EncryptionType -> (string)
              The server-side encryption type used on the stream. This parame-
              ter can be one of the following values:

              o NONE : Do not encrypt the records in the stream.

              o KMS  : Use server-side encryption on the records in the stream
                using a customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key.

          KeyId -> (string)
              The GUID for the customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key to
              use  for encryption. This value can be a globally unique identi-
              fier, a fully specified ARN to either an alias or a key,  or  an
              alias  name  prefixed  by "alias/".You can also use a master key
              owned by Kinesis Data Streams by specifying the alias  aws/kine-
              sis .

              o Key                        ARN                        example:
