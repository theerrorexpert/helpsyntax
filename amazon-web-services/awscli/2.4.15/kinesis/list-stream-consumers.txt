LIST-STREAM-CONSUMERS()                                LIST-STREAM-CONSUMERS()



NAME
       list-stream-consumers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  consumers  registered  to  receive data from a stream using
       enhanced fan-out, and provides information about each consumer.

       This operation has a limit of 5 transactions per second per stream.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stream-consumers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Consumers

SYNOPSIS
            list-stream-consumers
          --stream-arn <value>
          [--stream-creation-timestamp <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the Kinesis data stream for which you want to list the
          registered consumers. For  more  information,  see  Amazon  Resource
          Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

       --stream-creation-timestamp (timestamp)
          Specify  this  input parameter to distinguish data streams that have
          the same name. For example, if you create a  data  stream  and  then
          delete  it,  and  you later create another data stream with the same
          name, you can use this input parameter to specify which of  the  two
          streams you want to list the consumers for.

          You can't specify this parameter if you specify the NextToken param-
          eter.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Consumers -> (list)
          An array of JSON objects. Each object represents one registered con-
          sumer.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the details of the consumer you regis-
              tered.  This  type  of object is returned by  RegisterStreamCon-
              sumer .

              ConsumerName -> (string)
                 The name of the consumer is something  you  choose  when  you
                 register the consumer.

              ConsumerARN -> (string)
                 When  you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates
                 an ARN for it. You need this ARN to be able to call  Subscri-
                 beToShard .

                 If  you  delete a consumer and then create a new one with the
                 same name, it won't have the same ARN.  That's  because  con-
                 sumer  ARNs contain the creation timestamp. This is important
                 to keep in mind if you have IAM policies that reference  con-
                 sumer ARNs.

              ConsumerStatus -> (string)
                 A  consumer can't read data while in the CREATING or DELETING
                 states.

              ConsumerCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)

       NextToken -> (string)
          When the number of consumers  that  are  registered  with  the  data
          stream  is greater than the default value for the MaxResults parame-
          ter, or if you explicitly specify a value  for  MaxResults  that  is
          less  than the number of registered consumers, the response includes
          a pagination token named NextToken . You can specify this  NextToken
          value  in  a subsequent call to ListStreamConsumers to list the next
          set of registered consumers. For more information about the  use  of
          this  pagination  token  when calling the ListStreamConsumers opera-
          tion, see  ListStreamConsumersInput$NextToken .

          WARNING:
              Tokens expire after 300 seconds. When you  obtain  a  value  for
              NextToken in the response to a call to ListStreamConsumers , you
              have 300 seconds to use that value. If you  specify  an  expired
              token  in a call to ListStreamConsumers , you get ExpiredNextTo-
              kenException .
