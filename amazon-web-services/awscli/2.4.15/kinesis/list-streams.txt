LIST-STREAMS()                                                  LIST-STREAMS()



NAME
       list-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your Kinesis data streams.

       The  number of streams may be too large to return from a single call to
       ListStreams . You can limit the number of returned  streams  using  the
       Limit parameter. If you do not specify a value for the Limit parameter,
       Kinesis Data Streams uses the default limit, which is currently 100.

       You can detect if there are more streams available to list by using the
       HasMoreStreams flag from the returned output. If there are more streams
       available, you can request more streams by using the name of  the  last
       stream returned by the ListStreams request in the ExclusiveStartStream-
       Name parameter in a subsequent request to ListStreams .  The  group  of
       stream  names  returned  by the subsequent request is then added to the
       list. You can continue this process until all  the  stream  names  have
       been collected in the list.
          ListStreams has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-streams is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: StreamNames

SYNOPSIS
            list-streams
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list data streams

       The following list-streams example lists all active data streams in the
       current account and region.

          aws kinesis list-streams

       Output:

          {
              "StreamNames": [
                  "samplestream",
                  "samplestream1"
              ]
          }

       For  more  information,  see Listing Streams in the Amazon Kinesis Data
       Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       StreamNames -> (list)
          The names of the streams that are associated  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services account making the ListStreams request.

          (string)

       HasMoreStreams -> (boolean)
          If set to true , there are more streams available to list.
