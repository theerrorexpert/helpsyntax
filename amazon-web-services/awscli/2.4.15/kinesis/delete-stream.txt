DELETE-STREAM()                                                DELETE-STREAM()



NAME
       delete-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  Kinesis  data  stream and all its shards and data. You must
       shut down any applications that are operating on the stream before  you
       delete  the  stream. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted
       stream, it receives the exception ResourceNotFoundException .

       If the stream is in the ACTIVE  state,  you  can  delete  it.  After  a
       DeleteStream  request,  the  specified  stream is in the DELETING state
       until Kinesis Data Streams completes the deletion.
          Note: Kinesis Data Streams might continue to accept  data  read  and
          write operations, such as  PutRecord ,  PutRecords , and  GetRecords
          , on a stream in the DELETING state until  the  stream  deletion  is
          complete.

       When  you  delete a stream, any shards in that stream are also deleted,
       and any tags are dissociated from the stream.

       You can use the  DescribeStreamSummary operation to check the state  of
       the stream, which is returned in StreamStatus .
          DeleteStream  has  a  limit  of  five  transactions  per  second per
          account.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-stream
          --stream-name <value>
          [--enforce-consumer-deletion | --no-enforce-consumer-deletion]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to delete.

       --enforce-consumer-deletion | --no-enforce-consumer-deletion (boolean)
          If this parameter is unset (null ) or if you set it to false  ,  and
          the  stream has registered consumers, the call to DeleteStream fails
          with a ResourceInUseException .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a data stream

       The following delete-stream example deletes the specified data  stream.

          aws kinesis delete-stream \
              --stream-name samplestream

       This command produces no output.

       Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
