DESCRIBE-STREAM-CONSUMER()                          DESCRIBE-STREAM-CONSUMER()



NAME
       describe-stream-consumer -

DESCRIPTION
       To get the description of a registered consumer, provide the ARN of the
       consumer. Alternatively, you can provide the ARN of the data stream and
       the  name  you  gave  the consumer when you registered it. You may also
       provide all three parameters, as long as they don't conflict with  each
       other.  If you don't know the name or ARN of the consumer that you want
       to describe, you can use the  ListStreamConsumers operation  to  get  a
       list of the descriptions of all the consumers that are currently regis-
       tered with a given data stream.

       This operation has a limit of 20 transactions per second per stream.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stream-consumer
          [--stream-arn <value>]
          [--consumer-name <value>]
          [--consumer-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Kinesis data stream that the consumer  is  registered
          with.  For  more  information,  see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and
          Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

       --consumer-name (string)
          The name that you gave to the consumer.

       --consumer-arn (string)
          The ARN returned by Kinesis Data Streams  when  you  registered  the
          consumer.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a data stream consumer

       The  following describe-stream-consumer example returns the description
       of the specified consumer, registered with the specified data stream.

          aws kinesis describe-stream-consumer \
              --stream-arn arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:012345678912:stream/samplestream \
              --consumer-name KinesisConsumerApplication

       Output:

          {
              "ConsumerDescription": {
                  "ConsumerName": "KinesisConsumerApplication",
                  "ConsumerARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:123456789012:stream/samplestream/consumer/KinesisConsumerApplication:1572383852",
                  "ConsumerStatus": "ACTIVE",
                  "ConsumerCreationTimestamp": 1572383852.0,
                  "StreamARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:123456789012:stream/samplestream"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ConsumerDescription -> (structure)
          An object that represents the details of the consumer.

          ConsumerName -> (string)
              The name of the consumer is something you choose when you regis-
              ter the consumer.

          ConsumerARN -> (string)
              When you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates  an
              ARN  for  it.  You  need  this  ARN to be able to call  Subscri-
              beToShard .

              If you delete a consumer and then create a new one with the same
              name,  it  won't have the same ARN. That's because consumer ARNs
              contain the creation timestamp. This is  important  to  keep  in
              mind if you have IAM policies that reference consumer ARNs.

          ConsumerStatus -> (string)
              A  consumer  can't  read  data while in the CREATING or DELETING
              states.

          ConsumerCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)

          StreamARN -> (string)
              The ARN of the stream with which you registered the consumer.
