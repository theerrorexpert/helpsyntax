REGISTER-STREAM-CONSUMER()                          REGISTER-STREAM-CONSUMER()



NAME
       register-stream-consumer -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a  consumer  with  a  Kinesis data stream. When you use this
       operation, the consumer you register can then call  SubscribeToShard to
       receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to
       2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate  is  unaf-
       fected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.

       You can register up to 20 consumers per stream. A  given  consumer  can
       only be registered with one stream at a time.

       For  an  example  of  how  to use this operations, see Enhanced Fan-Out
       Using the Kinesis Data Streams API .

       The use of this operation has a limit of five transactions  per  second
       per  account.  Also, only 5 consumers can be created simultaneously. In
       other words, you cannot have more than 5 consumers in a CREATING status
       at  the  same  time.  Registering a 6th consumer while there are 5 in a
       CREATING status results in a LimitExceededException .

SYNOPSIS
            register-stream-consumer
          --stream-arn <value>
          --consumer-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Kinesis data stream that you  want  to  register  the
          consumer  with.  For more info, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and
          Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

       --consumer-name (string)
          For a given Kinesis data stream, each consumer must  have  a  unique
          name.  However,  consumer  names don't have to be unique across data
          streams.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register a data stream consumer

       The following register-stream-consumer  example  registers  a  consumer
       called KinesisConsumerApplication with the specified data stream.

          aws kinesis register-stream-consumer \
              --stream-arn arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:012345678912:stream/samplestream \
              --consumer-name KinesisConsumerApplication

       Output:

          {
              "Consumer": {
                  "ConsumerName": "KinesisConsumerApplication",
                  "ConsumerARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2: 123456789012:stream/samplestream/consumer/KinesisConsumerApplication:1572383852",
                  "ConsumerStatus": "CREATING",
                  "ConsumerCreationTimestamp": 1572383852.0
              }
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Consumer -> (structure)
          An  object  that  represents  the details of the consumer you regis-
          tered. When you register a consumer, it gets an ARN that  is  gener-
          ated by Kinesis Data Streams.

          ConsumerName -> (string)
              The name of the consumer is something you choose when you regis-
              ter the consumer.

          ConsumerARN -> (string)
              When you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates  an
              ARN  for  it.  You  need  this  ARN to be able to call  Subscri-
              beToShard .

              If you delete a consumer and then create a new one with the same
              name,  it  won't have the same ARN. That's because consumer ARNs
              contain the creation timestamp. This is  important  to  keep  in
              mind if you have IAM policies that reference consumer ARNs.

          ConsumerStatus -> (string)
              A  consumer  can't  read  data while in the CREATING or DELETING
              states.

          ConsumerCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
