DEREGISTER-STREAM-CONSUMER()                      DEREGISTER-STREAM-CONSUMER()



NAME
       deregister-stream-consumer -

DESCRIPTION
       To  deregister a consumer, provide its ARN. Alternatively, you can pro-
       vide the ARN of the data stream and the name you gave the consumer when
       you  registered  it. You may also provide all three parameters, as long
       as they don't conflict with each other. If you don't know the  name  or
       ARN of the consumer that you want to deregister, you can use the  List-
       StreamConsumers operation to get a list of the descriptions of all  the
       consumers  that  are currently registered with a given data stream. The
       description of a consumer contains its name and ARN.

       This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per  stream.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-stream-consumer
          [--stream-arn <value>]
          [--consumer-name <value>]
          [--consumer-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the Kinesis data stream that the consumer is registered
          with. For more information, see Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  and
          Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

       --consumer-name (string)
          The name that you gave to the consumer.

       --consumer-arn (string)
          The  ARN  returned  by  Kinesis Data Streams when you registered the
          consumer. If you don't know the ARN of the consumer that you want to
          deregister,  you  can use the ListStreamConsumers operation to get a
          list of the descriptions of all the  consumers  that  are  currently
          registered  with  a given data stream. The description of a consumer
          contains its ARN.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To deregister a data stream consumer

       The following deregister-stream-consumer example deregisters the speci-
       fied consumer from the specified data stream.

          aws kinesis deregister-stream-consumer \
              --stream-arn arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:123456789012:stream/samplestream \
              --consumer-name KinesisConsumerApplication

       This command produces no output.

       Using the Kinesis Data Streams API in the Amazon Kinesis  Data  Streams
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
