DECREASE-STREAM-RETENTION-PERIOD()          DECREASE-STREAM-RETENTION-PERIOD()



NAME
       decrease-stream-retention-period -

DESCRIPTION
       Decreases  the  Kinesis  data  stream's  retention period, which is the
       length of time data records are accessible after they are added to  the
       stream. The minimum value of a stream's retention period is 24 hours.

       This  operation  may  result in lost data. For example, if the stream's
       retention period is 48 hours and is decreased to  24  hours,  any  data
       already in the stream that is older than 24 hours is inaccessible.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            decrease-stream-retention-period
          --stream-name <value>
          --retention-period-hours <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to modify.

       --retention-period-hours (integer)
          The  new retention period of the stream, in hours. Must be less than
          the current retention period.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To decrease data stream retention period

       The following decrease-stream-retention-period  example  decreases  the
       retention  period (the length of time data records are accessible after
       they are added to the stream) of a  stream  named  samplestream  to  48
       hours.

          aws kinesis decrease-stream-retention-period \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --retention-period-hours 48

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information,  see  Changing the Data Retention Period in the
       Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
