MERGE-SHARDS()                                                  MERGE-SHARDS()



NAME
       merge-shards -

DESCRIPTION
       Merges  two  adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them
       into a single shard to reduce  the  stream's  capacity  to  ingest  and
       transport  data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the
       hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no  gaps.
       For  example,  if  you  have  two  shards, one with a hash key range of
       276...381 and the other with a hash key range of  382...454,  then  you
       could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash
       key range of  276...454.  After  the  merge,  the  single  child  shard
       receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent shards.
          MergeShards is called when there is a need  to  reduce  the  overall
          capacity  of  a  stream because of excess capacity that is not being
          used. You must specify the shard to be merged and the adjacent shard
          for  a  stream. For more information about merging shards, see Merge
          Two Shards in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .

       If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can call MergeShards .  If  a
       stream  is  in the CREATING , UPDATING , or DELETING state, MergeShards
       returns a ResourceInUseException . If the  specified  stream  does  not
       exist, MergeShards returns a ResourceNotFoundException .

       You  can  use   DescribeStreamSummary to check the state of the stream,
       which is returned in StreamStatus .
          MergeShards is an asynchronous operation. Upon  receiving  a  Merge-
          Shards  request,  Amazon  Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a
          response and sets the StreamStatus to UPDATING . After the operation
          is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the StreamStatus to ACTIVE .
          Read and write operations continue to work while the  stream  is  in
          the UPDATING state.

       You  use   DescribeStreamSummary  and the  ListShards APIs to determine
       the shard IDs that are specified in the MergeShards request.

       If you try to operate on too many streams  in  parallel  using   Creat-
       eStream  ,  DeleteStream , MergeShards , or  SplitShard , you receive a
       LimitExceededException .
          MergeShards has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

SYNOPSIS
            merge-shards
          --stream-name <value>
          --shard-to-merge <value>
          --adjacent-shard-to-merge <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream for the merge.

       --shard-to-merge (string)
          The shard ID of the shard to combine with the adjacent shard for the
          merge.

       --adjacent-shard-to-merge (string)
          The shard ID of the adjacent shard for the merge.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To merge shards

       The following merge-shards example merges two adjacent shards with  IDs
       of shardId-000000000000  and shardId-000000000001 in the specified data
       stream and combines them into a single shard.

          aws kinesis merge-shards \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --shard-to-merge shardId-000000000000 \
              --adjacent-shard-to-merge shardId-000000000001

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Merging Two Shards in the Amazon Kinesis Data
       Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
