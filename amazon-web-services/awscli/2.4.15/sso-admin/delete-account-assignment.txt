          --instance-arn <value>
          --target-id <value>
          --target-type <value>

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The ARN of the SSO instance under which the operation will  be  exe-
          cuted.  For  more  information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names
          (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon  Web
          Services General Reference .

       --target-id (string)
          TargetID  is  an Amazon Web Services account identifier, typically a
          10-12 digit string (For example, 123456789012).

       --target-type (string)
          The entity type for which the assignment will be deleted.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_ACCOUNT

       --permission-set-arn (string)
          The ARN of the permission set that will be used to remove access.

       --principal-type (string)
          The entity type for which the assignment will be deleted.

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o GROUP

       --principal-id (string)
          An identifier for an object in Amazon Web Services SSO,  such  as  a
          user    or    group.    PrincipalIds   are   GUIDs   (For   example,
          f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6). For  more  information  about
          PrincipalIds in Amazon Web Services SSO, see the Amazon Web Services
          SSO Identity Store API Reference .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
