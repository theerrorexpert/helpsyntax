ATTACH-MANAGED-POLICY-TO-PERMISSION-SATTACH-MANAGED-POLICY-TO-PERMISSION-SET()



NAME
       attach-managed-policy-to-permission-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches an IAM managed policy ARN to a permission set.

       NOTE:
          If  the  permission set is already referenced by one or more account
          assignments, you will need to  call  ``   ProvisionPermissionSet  ``
          after  this  operation.  Calling  ProvisionPermissionSet applies the
          corresponding IAM policy updates to all assigned accounts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            attach-managed-policy-to-permission-set
          --instance-arn <value>
          --permission-set-arn <value>
          --managed-policy-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The ARN of the SSO instance under which the operation will  be  exe-
          cuted.  For  more  information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names
          (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon  Web
          Services General Reference .

       --permission-set-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the   PermissionSet  that the managed policy should be
          attached to.

       --managed-policy-arn (string)
          The IAM managed policy ARN to be attached to a permission set.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
