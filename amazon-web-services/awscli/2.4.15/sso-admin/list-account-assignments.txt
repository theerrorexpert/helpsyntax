LIST-ACCOUNT-ASSIGNMENTS()                          LIST-ACCOUNT-ASSIGNMENTS()



NAME
       list-account-assignments -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  assignee  of the specified Amazon Web Services account with
       the specified permission set.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-account-assignments is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: AccountAssignments

SYNOPSIS
            list-account-assignments
          --instance-arn <value>
          --account-id <value>
          --permission-set-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the SSO instance under which the operation will be exe-
          cuted. For more information about ARNs, see  Amazon  Resource  Names
          (ARNs)  and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web
          Services General Reference .

       --account-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Web Services account from which to list
          the assignments.

       --permission-set-arn (string)
          The ARN of the permission set from which to list assignments.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccountAssignments -> (list)
          The list of assignments that match the  input  Amazon  Web  Services
          account and permission set.

          (structure)
              The  assignment that indicates a principal's limited access to a
              specified Amazon Web Services account with a  specified  permis-
              sion set.

              NOTE:
                 The  term  principal  here  refers to a user or group that is
                 defined in Amazon Web Services SSO.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Amazon Web Services account.

              PermissionSetArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the permission set.  For  more  information  about
                 ARNs,  see  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web  Services  General
                 Reference .

              PrincipalType -> (string)
                 The entity type for which the assignment will be created.

              PrincipalId -> (string)
                 An  identifier for an object in Amazon Web Services SSO, such
                 as a user or group.  PrincipalIds  are  GUIDs  (For  example,
                 f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6).  For  more information
                 about PrincipalIds in Amazon Web Services SSO, see the Amazon
                 Web Services SSO Identity Store API Reference .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination token for the list API. Initially the value is null.
          Use the output of previous API calls to make subsequent calls.
