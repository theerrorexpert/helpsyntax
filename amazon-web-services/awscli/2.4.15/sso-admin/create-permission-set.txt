          [--description <value>]
          --instance-arn <value>
          [--session-duration <value>]
          [--relay-state <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the  PermissionSet .

       --description (string)
          The description of the  PermissionSet .

       --instance-arn (string)
          The ARN of the SSO instance under which the operation will  be  exe-
          cuted.  For  more  information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names
          (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon  Web
          Services General Reference .

       --session-duration (string)
          The  length  of time that the application user sessions are valid in
          the ISO-8601 standard.

       --relay-state (string)
          Used to redirect users within the application during the  federation
          authentication process.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to attach to the new  PermissionSet .

          (structure)
              A  set  of key-value pairs that are used to manage the resource.
              Tags can only be  applied  to  permission  sets  and  cannot  be
              applied to corresponding roles that Amazon Web Services SSO cre-
              ates in Amazon Web Services accounts.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
