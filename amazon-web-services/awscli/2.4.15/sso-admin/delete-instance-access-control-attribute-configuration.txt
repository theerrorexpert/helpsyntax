NAME
       delete-instance-access-control-attribute-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  the  attributes-based  access  control (ABAC) feature for the
       specified Amazon Web Services SSO  instance  and  deletes  all  of  the
       attribute  mappings  that  have  been  configured.  Once  deleted,  any
       attributes that are received from an identity  source  and  any  custom
       attributes  you have previously configured will not be passed. For more
       information about ABAC, see Attribute-Based Access Control in the  Ama-
       zon Web Services SSO User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-instance-access-control-attribute-configuration
          --instance-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the SSO instance under which the operation will be exe-
          cuted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
