       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-report-group
          --name <value>
          --type <value>
          --export-config <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the report group.

       --type (string)
          The type of report group.

          Possible values:

          o TEST

          o CODE_COVERAGE

       --export-config (structure)
          A ReportExportConfig object that contains  information  about  where
          the report group test results are exported.

          exportConfigType -> (string)
              The export configuration type. Valid values are:

              o S3 : The report results are exported to an S3 bucket.

              o NO_EXPORT : The report results are not exported.

          s3Destination -> (structure)
              A  S3ReportExportConfig  object  that contains information about
              the S3 bucket where the run of a report is exported.

              bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket where the raw data of a report  are
                 exported.

              bucketOwner -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services account identifier of the owner of
                 the Amazon S3 bucket. This allows report data to be  exported
                 to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by an account other than
                 the account running the build.

              path -> (string)
                 The path to the exported report's raw data results.

              packaging -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact  to  create.  Valid  values
                 include:

                 o NONE : CodeBuild creates the raw data in the output bucket.
                   This is the default if packaging is not specified.

                 o ZIP : CodeBuild creates a ZIP file with the raw data in the
                   output bucket.

              encryptionKey -> (string)
                 The encryption key for the report's encrypted raw data.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 A boolean value that specifies if the results of a report are
                 encrypted.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          exportConfigType=string,s3Destination={bucket=string,bucketOwner=string,path=string,packaging=string,encryptionKey=string,encryptionDisabled=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "exportConfigType": "S3"|"NO_EXPORT",
            "s3Destination": {
              "bucket": "string",
              "bucketOwner": "string",
              "path": "string",
              "packaging": "ZIP"|"NONE",
              "encryptionKey": "string",
              "encryptionDisabled": true|false
            }
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tag key and value pairs associated with this report group.

          These  tags  are  available  for use by Amazon Web Services services
          that support CodeBuild report group tags.

          (structure)
              A tag, consisting of a key and a value.

              This tag is available for use by Amazon  Web  Services  services
              that support tags in CodeBuild.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a report group in AWS CodeBuild.

       The following create-report-group example creates a new report group.

              --cli-input-json file://create-report-group-source.json

       Contents of create-report-group-source.json:

          {
              "name": "cli-created-report-group",
              "type": "TEST",
              "exportConfig": {
