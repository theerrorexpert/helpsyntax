DESCRIBE-CODE-COVERAGES()                            DESCRIBE-CODE-COVERAGES()



NAME
       describe-code-coverages -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves one or more code coverage reports.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-code-coverages  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: codeCoverages

SYNOPSIS
            describe-code-coverages
          --report-arn <value>
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--min-line-coverage-percentage <value>]
          [--max-line-coverage-percentage <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --report-arn (string)
          The ARN of the report for which test cases are returned.

       --sort-order (string)
          Specifies if the results  are  sorted  in  ascending  or  descending
          order.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --sort-by (string)
          Specifies how the results are sorted. Possible values are:
              FILE_PATH

          The results are sorted by file path.
              LINE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE

          The  results are sorted by the percentage of lines that are covered.

          Possible values:

          o LINE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE

          o FILE_PATH

       --min-line-coverage-percentage (double)
          The minimum line coverage percentage to report.

       --max-line-coverage-percentage (double)
          The maximum line coverage percentage to report.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  get  detailed  information  about code coverage test results in AWS
       CodeBuild.

       The following describe-code-coverages example  gets  information  about
       the code coverage test results in the specified report.

          aws codebuild describe-code-coverages \

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more items to return, this contains  a  token  that  is
          passed to a subsequent call to DescribeCodeCoverages to retrieve the
          next set of items.

       codeCoverages -> (list)
          An array of CodeCoverage objects that contain the results.

          (structure)
              Contains code coverage report information.

              Line coverage measures how many statements your tests  cover.  A
              statement  is a single instruction, not including comments, con-
              ditionals, etc.

              Branch coverage determines if your tests  cover  every  possible
              branch  of a control structure, such as an if or case statement.

              id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the code coverage report.

              reportARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the report.

              filePath -> (string)
                 The path of the test report file.

              lineCoveragePercentage -> (double)
                 The percentage of lines that are covered by your tests.

              linesCovered -> (integer)
                 The number of lines that are covered by your tests.

              linesMissed -> (integer)
                 The number of lines that are not covered by your tests.

              branchCoveragePercentage -> (double)
                 The percentage of branches that are covered by your tests.

              branchesCovered -> (integer)
                 The number of conditional branches that are covered  by  your
                 tests.

              branchesMissed -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  conditional branches that are not covered by
                 your tests.

              expired -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the tests were run.
