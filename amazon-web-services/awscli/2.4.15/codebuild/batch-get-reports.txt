NAME
       batch-get-reports -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of reports.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-reports
          --report-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --report-arns (list)
          An array of ARNs that identify the Report objects to return.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about one or more reports in AWS CodeBuild.

       The following batch-get-reports example retrieves information about the
       reports with the specified ARNs.

          aws codebuild batch-get-reports \
              --report-arns arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report 1 ID> arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report 2 ID>

          The array of Report objects returned by BatchGetReports .

          (structure)
              Information  about  the  results  from  running a series of test
              cases during the run of a build  project.  The  test  cases  are
              specified  in  the  buildspec for the build project using one or
              more paths to the test case files. You can specify any  type  of
              tests you want, such as unit tests, integration tests, and func-
              tional tests.

              reportGroupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the report group associated with this report.

              executionId -> (string)
                 The ARN of the build run that generated this report.

              status -> (string)

              created -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time this report run occurred.

              expired -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a report expires. A report expires 30  days
                 after  it  is  created. An expired report is not available to
                 view in CodeBuild.

              exportConfig -> (structure)
                 Information about where the raw data used  to  generate  this
                 report was exported.

                 exportConfigType -> (string)
                     The export configuration type. Valid values are:

                     o S3 : The report results are exported to an S3 bucket.

                     o NO_EXPORT : The report results are not exported.

                 s3Destination -> (structure)
                     A  S3ReportExportConfig  object that contains information
                     about the  S3  bucket  where  the  run  of  a  report  is
                     exported.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  S3  bucket where the raw data of a

                     bucketOwner -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web  Services  account  identifier  of  the
                        owner of the Amazon S3 bucket. This allows report data
                        to be exported to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by
                        an account other than the account running the build.

                     path -> (string)
                        The path to the exported report's raw data results.

                     packaging -> (string)
                        The  type  of  build  output artifact to create. Valid
                        values include:

                        o NONE : CodeBuild creates the raw data in the  output
                          bucket.  This  is  the  default  if packaging is not
                          specified.

                        o ZIP : CodeBuild creates a ZIP file with the raw data
                          in the output bucket.

                        data.

                     encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                        A boolean value that specifies if  the  results  of  a
                        report are encrypted.

              truncated -> (boolean)
                 A boolean that specifies if this report run is truncated. The
                 list of test cases is truncated after the maximum  number  of
                 test cases is reached.

              testSummary -> (structure)
                 A  TestReportSummary  object  that contains information about
                 this test report.

                 total -> (integer)
                     The number of test cases in this TestReportSummary .  The
                     total includes truncated test cases.

                 statusCounts -> (map)
                     A  map  that  contains  the number of each type of status
                     returned by the test results in this TestReportSummary  .

                     key -> (string)

                 durationInNanoSeconds -> (long)
                     The  number of nanoseconds it took to run all of the test
                     cases in this report.
