LIST-BUILD-BATCHES-FOR-PROJECT()              LIST-BUILD-BATCHES-FOR-PROJECT()



NAME
       list-build-batches-for-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the identifiers of the build batches for a specific project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-build-batches-for-project is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ids

SYNOPSIS
            list-build-batches-for-project
          [--project-name <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project.

       --filter (structure)
          A BuildBatchFilter object that specifies the filters for the search.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the batch builds to retrieve.  Only  batch  builds
              that have this status will be retrieved.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "status": "SUCCEEDED"|"FAILED"|"FAULT"|"TIMED_OUT"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"STOPPED"
          }

       --sort-order (string)
          Specifies  the  sort  order  of  the  returned  items.  Valid values
          include:

          o ASCENDING : List the batch build identifiers in ascending order by
            identifier.

          o DESCENDING  : List the batch build identifiers in descending order
            by identifier.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list batch builds for a specific build project in AWS CodeBuild.

       The  following  list-build-batches-for-project  example lists the Code-
       Build batch builds for the specified project.

          aws codebuild list-build-batches-for-project \
              --project-name "<project-name>"

       Output:

          {
              "ids": [
                  "<project-name>:<batch-ID>",
                  "<project-name>:<batch-ID>"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Batch builds in  AWS  CodeBuild  in  the  AWS
       CodeBuild User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ids -> (list)
          An array of strings that contains the batch build identifiers.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  there  are  more  items to return, this contains a token that is
          passed  to  a  subsequent  call  to  ListBuildBatchesForProject   to
          retrieve the next set of items.
