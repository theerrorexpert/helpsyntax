NAME
       list-reports-for-report-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of ARNs for the reports that belong to a ReportGroup .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-reports-for-report-group  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: reports

SYNOPSIS
            list-reports-for-report-group
          --report-group-arn <value>
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --report-group-arn (string)
          The ARN of the report group for which  you  want  to  return  report
          ARNs.

       --sort-order (string)
          Use  to  specify  whether  the  results are returned in ascending or
          descending order.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --filter (structure)
          A ReportFilter object used to filter the returned reports.

          status -> (string)
              The status used to filter reports. You can filter using one sta-
              tus only.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "status": "GENERATING"|"SUCCEEDED"|"FAILED"|"INCOMPLETE"|"DELETING"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of the reports in a report group in AWS CodeBuild.

       The  following  list-report-for-report-groups  example  retrieves   the
       reports in the specified report group for the account in the region.

          aws codebuild list-reports-for-report-group \
              --report-group-arn arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report-group/<report-group-name>

       Output:

          {
              "reports": [
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/report-1",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/report-2",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/report-3"
              ]
          }

       For  more  information, see Working with report groups in the AWS Code-
       Build User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          During a previous call, the maximum number  of  items  that  can  be
          returned  is the value specified in maxResults . If there more items
          in the list, then a unique string called a nextToken is returned. To
          get  the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again,
          adding the next token to the call. To get all of the  items  in  the
          list,  keep  calling  this operation with each subsequent next token
          that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

       reports -> (list)
          The list of report ARNs.

          (string)
