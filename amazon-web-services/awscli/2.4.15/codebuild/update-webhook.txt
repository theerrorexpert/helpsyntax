       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-webhook
          --project-name <value>
          [--branch-filter <value>]
          [--rotate-secret | --no-rotate-secret]
          [--filter-groups <value>]
          [--build-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the CodeBuild project.

       --branch-filter (string)
          A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are
          built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a  branch  matches
          the  regular expression, then it is built. If branchFilter is empty,
          then all branches are built.

          NOTE:
              It is recommended that you use filterGroups instead  of  branch-
              Filter .

       --rotate-secret | --no-rotate-secret (boolean)
          A boolean value that specifies whether the associated GitHub reposi-
          tory's secret token should be updated. If you use Bitbucket for your
          repository, rotateSecret is ignored.

       --filter-groups (list)
          An  array  of arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine if a
          webhook event can trigger a build. A filter group  must  contain  at
          least one EVENT  WebhookFilter .

          (list)
              (structure)
                 A filter used to determine which webhooks trigger a build.

                 type -> (string)
                     The  type of webhook filter. There are six webhook filter
                     types: EVENT , ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID , HEAD_REF ,  BASE_REF  ,
                     FILE_PATH , and COMMIT_MESSAGE .
                        EVENT

                     A  webhook  event triggers a build when the provided pat-
                     tern  matches  one  of   five   event   types:   PUSH   ,
                     PULL_REQUEST_CREATED     ,     PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED     ,
                     PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED ,  and  PULL_REQUEST_MERGED  .  The
                     EVENT patterns are specified as a comma-separated string.
                     For      example,       PUSH,       PULL_REQUEST_CREATED,
                     PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED  filters all push, pull request cre-
                     ated, and pull request updated events.

                     NOTE:
                        The PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED works with GitHub and GitHub
                        Enterprise only.

                        ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID

                     A  webhook  event  triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub
                     Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches  the  regular
                     expression pattern .
                        HEAD_REF

                     A  webhook event triggers a build when the head reference
                     matches the regular expression  pattern  .  For  example,
                     refs/heads/branch-name and refs/tags/tag-name .

                     Works  with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and
                     GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and  Bit-
                     bucket pull request events.
                        BASE_REF

                     A  webhook event triggers a build when the base reference
                     matches the regular expression  pattern  .  For  example,
                     refs/heads/branch-name .

                     NOTE:
                        Works with pull request events only.

                        FILE_PATH

                     A  webhook  triggers  a  build when the path of a changed
                     file matches the regular expression pattern .

                     NOTE:
                        Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push  and  pull
                        requests  events.  Also  works  with GitHub Enterprise
                        push events, but does not work with GitHub  Enterprise
                        pull request events.

                        COMMIT_MESSAGE

                     A  webhook  triggers a build when the head commit message
                     matches the regular expression pattern .

                     NOTE:
                        Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push  and  pull
                        requests  events.  Also  works  with GitHub Enterprise
                        push events, but does not work with GitHub  Enterprise
                        pull request events.

                 pattern -> (string)
                     For  a  WebHookFilter that uses EVENT type, a comma-sepa-
                     rated string that specifies one or more events. For exam-
                     ple,   the  webhook  filter  PUSH,  PULL_REQUEST_CREATED,
                     PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED allows all push, pull  request  cre-
                     ated, and pull request updated events to trigger a build.

                     For a WebHookFilter that uses any  of  the  other  filter
                     types,  a regular expression pattern. For example, a Web-
                     HookFilter that uses HEAD_REF for its type and  the  pat-
                     tern  ^refs/heads/  triggers a build when the head refer-
                     ence   is   a    branch    with    a    reference    name
                     refs/heads/branch-name .

                 excludeMatchedPattern -> (boolean)
                     Used  to  indicate that the pattern determines which web-
                     hook events do not trigger a build. If true, then a  web-
                     hook  event  that  does  not match the pattern triggers a
                     build. If false, then a webhook event  that  matches  the
                     pattern triggers a build.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          [{type=string,pattern=string,excludeMatchedPattern=boolean},{type=string,pattern=string,excludeMatchedPattern=boolean}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            [
              {
                "type": "EVENT"|"BASE_REF"|"HEAD_REF"|"ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID"|"FILE_PATH"|"COMMIT_MESSAGE",
                "pattern": "string",
                "excludeMatchedPattern": true|false
              }
              ...
            ]
            ...
          ]

       --build-type (string)
          Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

          Possible values:

          o BUILD

          o BUILD_BATCH

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To update the webhook for an AWS CodeBuild project

       The  following  update-webhook example updates a webhook for the speci-
       fied CodeBuild project with  two  filter  groups.  The  --rotate-secret
       parameter  specifies  that GitHub rotate the project's secret key every
       time a code change triggers a build. The first filter  group  specifies
       pull  requests  that are created, updated, or reopened on branches with
       Git reference names that match the regular expression  ^refs/heads/mas-
       ter$  and head references that match ^refs/heads/myBranch$.  The second
       filter group specifies push requests on  branches  with  Git  reference
       names that do not match the regular expression ^refs/heads/myBranch$.

          aws codebuild update-webhook \
              --project-name Project2 \
              --rotate-secret \
              --filter-groups "[[{\"type\":\"EVENT\",\"pattern\":\"PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED, PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED\"},{\"type\":\"HEAD_REF\",\"pattern\":\"^refs/heads/myBranch$\",\"excludeMatchedPattern\":true},{\"type\":\"BASE_REF\",\"pattern\":\"^refs/heads/master$\",\"excludeMatchedPattern\":true}],[{\"type\":\"EVENT\",\"pattern\":\"PUSH\"},{\"type\":\"HEAD_REF\",\"pattern\":\"^refs/heads/myBranch$\",\"excludeMatchedPattern\":true}]]"

OUTPUT
       webhook -> (structure)
          Information about a repository's webhook that is associated  with  a
          project in CodeBuild.

          url -> (string)
              The URL to the webhook.

          payloadUrl -> (string)
              The CodeBuild endpoint where webhook events are sent.

          secret -> (string)
              The secret token of the associated repository.

              NOTE:
                 A Bitbucket webhook does not support secret .

          branchFilter -> (string)
              A regular expression used to determine which repository branches
              are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of  a  branch
              matches  the regular expression, then it is built. If branchFil-
              ter is empty, then all branches are built.

              NOTE:
                 It is  recommended  that  you  use  filterGroups  instead  of
                 branchFilter .

          filterGroups -> (list)
              An  array  of  arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine
              which webhooks are triggered. At least one WebhookFilter in  the
              array must specify EVENT as its type .

              For  a  build  to be triggered, at least one filter group in the
              filterGroups array must pass. For a filter group to  pass,  each
              of its filters must pass.

              (list)
                 (structure)
                     A  filter  used  to  determine  which  webhooks trigger a
                     build.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of webhook filter. There are six webhook fil-
                        ter  types:  EVENT  ,  ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID  ,  HEAD_REF ,
                        BASE_REF , FILE_PATH , and COMMIT_MESSAGE .
                            EVENT

                        A webhook event triggers a  build  when  the  provided
                        pattern  matches  one  of  five  event  types:  PUSH ,
                        PULL_REQUEST_CREATED    ,    PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED    ,
                        PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED  , and PULL_REQUEST_MERGED . The
                        EVENT patterns  are  specified  as  a  comma-separated
                        string.   For   example,  PUSH,  PULL_REQUEST_CREATED,
                        PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED filters all  push,  pull  request
                        created, and pull request updated events.

                        NOTE:
                            The  PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED  works  with GitHub and
                            GitHub Enterprise only.

                            ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID

                        A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub
                        Enterprise,  or Bitbucket account ID matches the regu-
                        lar expression pattern .
                            HEAD_REF

                        A webhook event triggers a build when the head  refer-
                        ence  matches  the  regular  expression  pattern . For
                        example, refs/heads/branch-name and refs/tags/tag-name
                        .

                        Works  with  GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub
                        and GitHub Enterprise pull  request,  Bitbucket  push,
                        and Bitbucket pull request events.
                            BASE_REF

                        A  webhook event triggers a build when the base refer-
                        ence matches the  regular  expression  pattern  .  For
                        example, refs/heads/branch-name .

                        NOTE:
                            Works with pull request events only.

                            FILE_PATH

                        A  webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed
                        file matches the regular expression pattern .

                        NOTE:
                            Works with GitHub and Bitbucket  events  push  and
                            pull  requests  events.  Also  works  with  GitHub
                            Enterprise push events, but  does  not  work  with
                            GitHub Enterprise pull request events.

                            COMMIT_MESSAGE

                        A  webhook  triggers a build when the head commit mes-
                        sage matches the regular expression pattern .

                        NOTE:
                            Works with GitHub and Bitbucket  events  push  and
                            pull  requests  events.  Also  works  with  GitHub
                            Enterprise push events, but  does  not  work  with
                            GitHub Enterprise pull request events.

                     pattern -> (string)
                        For a WebHookFilter that uses EVENT type, a comma-sep-
                        arated string that specifies one or more  events.  For
                        example,  the  webhook  filter PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CRE-
                        ATED,  PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED  allows  all  push,   pull
                        request  created,  and  pull request updated events to
                        trigger a build.

                        For a WebHookFilter that uses any of the other  filter
                        types,  a  regular  expression pattern. For example, a
                        WebHookFilter that uses HEAD_REF for its type and  the
                        pattern  ^refs/heads/  triggers  a build when the head
                        reference  is  a  branch   with   a   reference   name
                        refs/heads/branch-name .

                     excludeMatchedPattern -> (boolean)
                        Used  to  indicate  that  the pattern determines which
                        webhook events do not trigger a build. If true, then a
                        webhook event that does not match the pattern triggers
                        a build. If false, then a webhook event  that  matches
                        the pattern triggers a build.

          buildType -> (string)
              Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

          lastModifiedSecret -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp  that indicates the last time a repository's secret
              token was modified.
