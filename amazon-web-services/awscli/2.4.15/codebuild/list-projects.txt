LIST-PROJECTS()                                                LIST-PROJECTS()



NAME
       list-projects -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of build project names, with each build project name repre-
       senting a single build project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-projects is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: projects

SYNOPSIS
            list-projects
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          The  criterion  to be used to list build project names. Valid values
          include:

          o CREATED_TIME : List based on when each build project was  created.

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME  :  List  based  on when information about each
            build project was last changed.

          o NAME : List based on each build project's name.

          Use sortOrder to specify in what order to  list  the  build  project
          names based on the preceding criteria.

          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o CREATED_TIME

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME

       --sort-order (string)
          The order in which to list build projects. Valid values include:

          o ASCENDING : List in ascending order.

          o DESCENDING : List in descending order.

          Use sortBy to specify the criterion to be used to list build project
          names.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of AWS CodeBuild build project names.

       The following list-projects example gets  a  list  of  CodeBuild  build
       projects sorted by name in ascending order.

          aws codebuild list-projects --sort-by NAME --sort-order ASCENDING

       The  output  includes  a  nextToken value which indicates that there is
       more output available.

          {
              "nextToken": "Ci33ACF6...The full token has been omitted for brevity...U+AkMx8=",
              "projects": [
                  "codebuild-demo-project",
                  "codebuild-demo-project2",
                      ... The full list of build project names has been omitted for brevity ...
                  "codebuild-demo-project99"
              ]
          }

       Run this command again and provide the nextToken value from the  previ-
       ous  response as a parameter to get the next part of the output. Repeat
       until you don't receive a nextToken value in the response.

          aws codebuild list-projects  --sort-by NAME --sort-order ASCENDING --next-token Ci33ACF6...The full token has been omitted for brevity...U+AkMx8=

          {
              "projects": [
                  "codebuild-demo-project100",
                  "codebuild-demo-project101",
                      ... The full list of build project names has been omitted for brevity ...
                  "codebuild-demo-project122"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see View a List of Build Project Names (AWS  CLI)
       in the AWS CodeBuild User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If  there  are  more  than 100 items in the list, only the first 100
          items are returned, along with a unique string called a nextToken  .
          To  get  the  next  batch  of items in the list, call this operation
          again, adding the next token to the call.

       projects -> (list)
          The list of build project names, with each build project name repre-
          senting a single build project.

          (string)
