BATCH-GET-REPORT-GROUPS()                            BATCH-GET-REPORT-GROUPS()



NAME
       batch-get-report-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of report groups.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-report-groups
          --report-group-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --report-group-arns (list)
          An  array  of  report  group ARNs that identify the report groups to
          return.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about one or more report groups in AWS CodeBuild.

       The following  batch-get-report-groups  example  retrieves  information
       about the report group with the specified ARN.

          aws codebuild batch-get-report-groups \
              --report-group-arns arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report-group/<report-group-name>

       Output:

          {
              "reportGroups": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report-group/<report-group-name>",
                      "name": "report-group-name",
                      "type": "TEST",
                      "exportConfig": {
                          "exportConfigType": "NO_EXPORT"
                      },
                      "created": "2020-10-01T18:04:08.466000+00:00",
                      "lastModified": "2020-10-01T18:04:08.466000+00:00",
                      "tags": []
                  }
              ],
              "reportGroupsNotFound": []
          }

          The array of report groups returned by BatchGetReportGroups .

          (structure)
              A series of reports. Each report contains information about  the
              results  from  running  a  series of test cases. You specify the
              test cases for a report group  in  the  buildspec  for  a  build
              project using one or more paths to the test case files.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the ReportGroup .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the ReportGroup .

              type -> (string)
                 The  type of the ReportGroup . This can be one of the follow-
                 ing values:
                     CODE_COVERAGE

                 The report group contains code coverage reports.
                     TEST

                 The report group contains test reports.

              exportConfig -> (structure)
                 Information about the destination where the raw data of  this
                 ReportGroup is exported.

                 exportConfigType -> (string)
                     The export configuration type. Valid values are:

                     o S3 : The report results are exported to an S3 bucket.

                     o NO_EXPORT : The report results are not exported.

                 s3Destination -> (structure)
                     A  S3ReportExportConfig  object that contains information
                     about the  S3  bucket  where  the  run  of  a  report  is
                     exported.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  S3  bucket where the raw data of a

                     bucketOwner -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web  Services  account  identifier  of  the
                        owner of the Amazon S3 bucket. This allows report data
                        to be exported to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by
                        an account other than the account running the build.

                     path -> (string)

                        o NONE : CodeBuild creates the raw data in the  output
                          bucket.  This  is  the  default  if packaging is not
                          specified.

                        o ZIP : CodeBuild creates a ZIP file with the raw data

                     encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                        A boolean value that specifies if  the  results  of  a
                        report are encrypted.

              created -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time this ReportGroup was created.

                 (structure)
                     A tag, consisting of a key and a value.

                     This tag is available for use by Amazon Web Services ser-
