RETRY-BUILD()                                                    RETRY-BUILD()



NAME
       retry-build -

DESCRIPTION
       Restarts a build.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            retry-build
          [--id <value>]
          [--idempotency-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          Specifies the identifier of the build to restart.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A  unique, case sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idem-
          potency of the RetryBuild request. The  token  is  included  in  the
          RetryBuild  request and is valid for five minutes. If you repeat the
          RetryBuild request with the same  token,  but  change  a  parameter,
          CodeBuild returns a parameter mismatch error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retry a failed build in AWS CodeBuild.

       The following retry-build example restarts the specified build.

          aws codebuild retry-build \
              --id <project-name>:<build-ID>

                 o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository.

                 o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in  an  CodeCommit  reposi-
                   tory.

                 o CODEPIPELINE  :  The  source code settings are specified in
                   the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                 o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub  or  GitHub  Enter-
                   prise Cloud repository.

                 o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE  :  The source code is in a GitHub Enter-
                   prise Server repository.

                 o For  source  code settings that are specified in the source
                   action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location  should  not
                   be  specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it.
                   This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in  a  pipe-
                   line's source action instead of this value.

                 o For  source  code  in  an  CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                   clone URL to the repository that contains the  source  code
                   and  the  buildspec file (for example, https://git-codecom-
                   mit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

                 o For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket,  one  of  the
                   following.

                   o The  path  to  the ZIP file that contains the source code
                     (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                   o The path to the folder that contains the source code (for
                     example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                 o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                   to  the  repository that contains the source and the build-
                   spec file.  You  must  connect  your  Amazon  Web  Services
                   account  to  your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console
                   to start creating a build project. When you use the console
                   to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Autho-
                   rize application page, for  Organization  access  ,  choose
                   Request  access  next  to each repository you want to allow
                   CodeBuild to have access  to,  and  then  choose  Authorize
                   application  .  (After  you  have  connected to your GitHub
                   account, you do not  need  to  finish  creating  the  build
                   project.  You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct
                   CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set
                   the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

                 o For  source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone
                   URL to the repository that  contains  the  source  and  the
                   buildspec  file.  You must connect your Amazon Web Services
                   account to your Bitbucket account. Use the  CodeBuild  con-
                   sole  to  start  creating a build project. When you use the
                   console to connect (or reconnect) with  Bitbucket,  on  the
                   Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant
                   access .  (After  you  have  connected  to  your  Bitbucket
                   account,  you  do  not  need  to  finish creating the build
                   project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To  instruct
                   CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set
                   the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

                 If you specify CODEPIPELINE  for  the  Type  property,  don't
                 specify  this  property. For all of the other types, you must
                 specify Location .

              gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                 Information about the Git clone depth for the build  project.

              gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  Git submodules configuration for the
                 build project.

                 fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to fetch Git submodules  for  your  CodeBuild
                     build project.

                 The  buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this
                 build project.

                 If this value is set, it can be either  an  inline  buildspec
                 definition,  the path to an alternate buildspec file relative
                 to the value of the  built-in  CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR  environment
                 variable,  or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in
                 the same Amazon Web Services Region  as  the  build  project.
                 Specify  the  buildspec  file  using  its  ARN  (for example,
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml  ).  If  this
                 value  is  not  provided  or  is  set to an empty string, the
                 source code must contain a buildspec file in its root  direc-
                 tory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Stor-
                 age Location .

                 Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                 type -> (string)

                     NOTE:
                        This data type is deprecated and is no longer accurate
                        or used.

                     The  authorization  type  to use. The only valid value is
                     OAUTH , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                 resource -> (string)

                 Set  to true to report the status of a build's start and fin-
                 ish to your source provider. This option is valid  only  when
                 your  source  provider  is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bit-
                 bucket. If this  is  set  and  you  use  a  different  source
                 provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

                 To be able to report the build status to the source provider,
                 the user associated with the source provider must have  write
                 access  to  the repo. If the user does not have write access,
                 the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see
                 Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 The  status  of  a  build  triggered  by  a webhook is always
                 reported to your source provider.

                 If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must
                 push  a  new commit to the repo for a change to this property
                 to take effect.

              buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains information  that  defines  how  the  build  project
                 reports  the build status to the source provider. This option
                 is  only  used  when  the  source  provider   is   GITHUB   ,
                 GITHUB_ENTERPRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                     be built. Valid values include:

                     o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a  Bitbucket  reposi-
                       tory.

                     o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in an CodeCommit repos-
                       itory.

                     o CODEPIPELINE : The source code settings  are  specified
                       in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                     o GITHUB  :  The  source  code  is  in a GitHub or GitHub
                       Enterprise Cloud repository.

                     o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE : The source  code  is  in  a  GitHub
                       Enterprise Server repository.

                     o NO_SOURCE  :  The  project  does  not have input source
                       code.

                     o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information about the location of the source code  to  be
                     built. Valid values include:

                     o For  source  code  settings  that  are specified in the
                       source action of a pipeline in  CodePipeline,  location
                       should  not  be  specified.  If  it is specified, Code-
                       Pipeline ignores it. This is because CodePipeline  uses
                       the  settings  in a pipeline's source action instead of
                       this value.

                     o For source code in an CodeCommit repository, the  HTTPS
                       clone  URL  to  the repository that contains the source
                       code   and   the   buildspec   file    (for    example,
                       https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazon-
                       aws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

                     o For source code in an Amazon S3 input  bucket,  one  of
                       the following.

                       o The  path  to  the  ZIP file that contains the source
                         code                  (for                   example,
                         <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                       o The  path to the folder that contains the source code
                         (for                                         example,
                         <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                     o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone
                       URL to the repository that contains the source and  the
                       buildspec  file.  You must connect your Amazon Web Ser-
                       vices account to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild
                       console to start creating a build project. When you use
                       the console to connect (or reconnect) with  GitHub,  on
                       the GitHub Authorize application page, for Organization
                       access , choose Request access next to each  repository
                       you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to, and then
                       choose Authorize application .  (After  you  have  con-
                       nected  to your GitHub account, you do not need to fin-
                       ish creating the build project. You can leave the Code-
                       Build  console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this con-
                       nection, in the source object, set  the  auth  object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     o For  source  code  in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS
                       clone URL to the repository that  contains  the  source
                       and  the  buildspec  file. You must connect your Amazon
                       Web Services account to your Bitbucket account. Use the
                       CodeBuild  console  to  start creating a build project.
                       When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with
                       Bitbucket,  on  the  Bitbucket  Confirm  access to your
                       account page, choose Grant access  .  (After  you  have
                       connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to
                       finish creating the build project. You  can  leave  the
                       CodeBuild  console.)  To instruct CodeBuild to use this
                       connection, in the source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     If  you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property, don't
                     specify this property. For all of the  other  types,  you
                     must specify Location .

                     Information about the Git  submodules  configuration  for
                     the build project.

                     fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                        Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild
                        build project.

                 buildspec -> (string)
                     The buildspec file declaration to use for the  builds  in
                     this build project.

                     If  this  value is set, it can be either an inline build-
                     spec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec  file
                     relative  to  the value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR
                     environment variable, or the path to an  S3  bucket.  The
                     bucket  must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as
                     the build project. Specify the buildspec file  using  its
                     ARN    (for    example,    arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sam-
                     ple2/buildspec.yml ). If this value is not provided or is
                     set  to  an  empty string, the source code must contain a
                     buildspec file in its root directory. For  more  informa-
                     tion, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location .

                     Information  about  the  authorization settings for Code-
                     Build to access the source code to be built.

                     This information is for the CodeBuild console's use only.
                     Your   code  should  not  get  or  set  this  information
                     directly.

                     type -> (string)

                        NOTE:
                            This data type is  deprecated  and  is  no  longer
                            accurate or used.

                        The authorization type to use. The only valid value is
                        OAUTH , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                     resource -> (string)
                        The  resource  value  that  applies  to  the specified
                        authorization type.

                 reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to report the status of a build's  start  and
                     finish to your source provider. This option is valid only
                     when your source provider is GitHub,  GitHub  Enterprise,
                     or  Bitbucket.  If  this  is  set and you use a different
                     source provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

                     To be able to report  the  build  status  to  the  source
                     provider,  the  user  associated with the source provider
                     must have write access to the repo. If the user does  not
                     have  write  access,  the build status cannot be updated.
                     For more information, see Source provider access  in  the
                     CodeBuild User Guide .

                     The  status  of  a build triggered by a webhook is always
                     reported to your source provider.

              sion must be one of:

              o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

              o For  GitHub:  the  commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or
                tag name that corresponds to the version of  the  source  code
                you  want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must
                use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example, pr/25 ). If  a
                branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used.
                If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

              o For  Bitbucket:  the  commit ID, branch name, or tag name that
                corresponds to the version of the  source  code  you  want  to
                build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit
                ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit
                ID is used.

              o For  Amazon  S3:  the version ID of the object that represents
                the build input ZIP file to use.

              (structure)
                 A source identifier and its corresponding version.

                 sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for a source  in  the  build  project.  The
                     identifier  can  only contain alphanumeric characters and
                     underscores, and must be  less  than  128  characters  in
                     length.

                 sourceVersion -> (string)
                     The  source  version for the corresponding source identi-
                     fier. If specified, must be one of:

                     o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or  Git  tag  to
                       use.

                     o For  GitHub:  the  commit  ID,  pull request ID, branch
                       name, or tag name that corresponds to  the  version  of
                       the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID
                       is specified, it must use the format pr/pull-request-ID
                       (for  example,  pr/25 ). If a branch name is specified,
                       the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not  specified,
                       the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                     o For  Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name
                       that corresponds to the version of the source code  you
                       want  to  build.  If  a  branch  name is specified, the
                       branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified,  the
                       default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                     o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that repre-
                       sents the build input ZIP file to use.

                     For more information,  see  Source  Version  Sample  with
                     CodeBuild in the CodeBuild User Guide .

          artifacts -> (structure)
              Information about the output artifacts for the build.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the location of the build artifacts.

              sha256sum -> (string)
                 The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                 You  can  use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm
                 file integrity and authenticity.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is available only if the build project's pack-
                     aging value is set to ZIP .

              md5sum -> (string)
                 The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                 You  can  use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm
                 file integrity and authenticity.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is available only if the build project's pack-
                     aging value is set to ZIP .

              overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                 If  this  flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file
                 overrides the artifact name. The name specified in  a  build-
                 spec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Com-
                 mand Language. For example, you can append a date and time to
                 your artifact name so that it is always unique.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Information  that tells you if encryption for build artifacts
                 is disabled.

              artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this artifact definition.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  another
                 account  uploads  to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To use this property, your CodeBuild  service  role  must
                     have  the  s3:PutBucketAcl  permission.  This  permission
                     allows CodeBuild to modify the access  control  list  for
                     the bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access  to  the  objects.  The
                 uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The  bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting,  the  bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of the
                   objects.

                 For more information about Amazon S3  object  ownership,  see
                 Controlling  ownership  of  uploaded  objects using S3 Object
                 Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

          secondaryArtifacts -> (list)
              An array of ProjectArtifacts objects.

              (structure)
                 Information about build output artifacts.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information about the location of the build artifacts.

                 sha256sum -> (string)
                     The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                     You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to  con-
                     firm file integrity and authenticity.

                     NOTE:
                        This  value  is  available only if the build project's
                        packaging value is set to ZIP .

                 md5sum -> (string)
                     The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                     You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to  con-
                     firm file integrity and authenticity.

                     NOTE:
                        This  value  is  available only if the build project's
                        packaging value is set to ZIP .

                 overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                     If this flag is set, a name specified  in  the  buildspec
                     file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a
                     buildspec file is calculated at build time and  uses  the
                     Shell  Command  Language.  For  example, you can append a
                     date and time to your artifact name so that it is  always
                     unique.

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Information  that tells you if encryption for build arti-
                     facts is disabled.

                 artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for this artifact definition.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies the bucket  owner's  access  for  objects  that
                     another  account  uploads  to  their Amazon S3 bucket. By
                     default, only the account that uploads the objects to the
                     bucket  has access to these objects. This property allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have  the  s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The  bucket  owner  does  not have access to the objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The  bucket  owner has full access to the objects. Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner  pre-
                       ferred  setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The
                       uploading account will have object access as  specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of
                       the objects.

                     User Guide .

          cache -> (structure)
              Information about the cache for the build.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  cache  used by the build project. Valid values
                 include:

                 o NO_CACHE : The build project does not use any cache.

                 o S3 : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.

                 o LOCAL : The build project stores a cache locally on a build
                   host that is only available to that build host.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the cache location:

                 o NO_CACHE or LOCAL : This value is ignored.

                 o S3 : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

              modes -> (list)
                 An  array  of strings that specify the local cache modes. You
                 can use one or more local cache modes at the same time.  This
                 is only used for LOCAL cache types.

                 Possible values are:
                     LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE

                 Caches  Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After
                 the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the  change
                 between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with
                 a clean working directory and a source that is  a  large  Git
                 repository.  If  you choose this option and your project does
                 not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or  Bit-
                 bucket), the option is ignored.
                     LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE

                 Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for
                 projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can  pre-
                 vent  the  performance  issues caused by pulling large Docker
                 images down from the network.

                 NOTE:

                     o You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux  environ-
                       ment only.

                     o The  privileged  flag  must be set so that your project
                       has the required Docker permissions.

                     o You should consider the  security  implications  before
                       you use a Docker layer cache.

                     LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE

                 Caches  directories  you  specify in the buildspec file. This
                 mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to
                 one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom
                 cache:

                 o Only directories can be specified for caching.  You  cannot
                   specify individual files.

                 o Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.

                 o Cached directories are linked to your build before it down-
                   loads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a
                   source  item  has  the same name. Directories are specified
                   using cache paths in the buildspec file.

                 (string)

          environment -> (structure)
              Information about the build environment for this build.

                            secret  access  keys.  PLAINTEXT environment vari-
                            ables can be displayed in  plain  text  using  the
                            CodeBuild  console and the CLI. For sensitive val-
                            ues, we recommend you use an environment  variable
                            of type PARAMETER_STORE or SECRETS_MANAGER .

                     type -> (string)
                        The   type   of  environment  variable.  Valid  values
                        include:

                        o PARAMETER_STORE : An environment variable stored  in
                          Systems  Manager  Parameter  Store.  To learn how to
                          specify a parameter store environment variable,  see
                          env/parameter-store in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                        o PLAINTEXT  :  An  environment variable in plain text
                          format. This is the default value.

                        o SECRETS_MANAGER : An environment variable stored  in
                          Secrets  Manager.  To learn how to specify a secrets
                          manager       environment       variable,        see
                          env/secrets-manager in the CodeBuild User Guide .

              privilegedMode -> (boolean)
                 Enables  running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container.
                 Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker
                 images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the
                 Docker daemon fails. The default setting is false .

                 You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase
                 of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands
                 to the install phase of your buildspec file:

                 If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:
                     -              nohup               /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     - timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo  .;  sleep
                     1; done"

                 If  the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the
                 previous command does not work, add the -t argument to  time-
                 out :
                     -               nohup              /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     -  timeout  -t  15  sh  -c "until docker info; do echo .;
                     sleep 1; done"

              certificate -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object  key
                 that  contains  the  PEM-encoded  certificate  for  the build
                 project. For more information, see certificate in  the  Code-
                 Build User Guide .

              registryCredential -> (structure)
                 The credentials for access to a private registry.

                 credential -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) or name of credentials
                     created using Secrets Manager.

                     NOTE:
                        The credential can use the  name  of  the  credentials
                        only if they exist in your current Amazon Web Services
                        Region.

                 credentialProvider -> (string)
                     The service that created the credentials to access a pri-
                     vate  Docker  registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER,
                     is for Secrets Manager.

              imagePullCredentialsType -> (string)
                 The type of credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in your
                 build. There are two valid values:

                 o CODEBUILD  specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses its own creden-
                   tials. This requires that you modify  your  ECR  repository
                   policy to trust CodeBuild service principal.

                 o SERVICE_ROLE  specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses  your  build
                   project's service role.

                 When you use a cross-account or private registry  image,  you
                 must  use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an CodeBuild
                 curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials.

          serviceRole -> (string)
              The name of a service role used for this build.

                 arn:${Partition}:logs:${Region}:${Account}:log-group:${Log-
                 GroupName}:log-stream:${LogStreamName} .  For  more  informa-
                 tion, see Resources Defined by CloudWatch Logs .

              s3LogsArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  S3  logs  for  a  build  project. Its format is
                 arn:${Partition}:s3:::${BucketName}/${ObjectName} . For  more

              s3Logs -> (structure)
                 Information about S3 logs for a build project.

                 status -> (string)
                     The current status of the S3  build  logs.  Valid  values
                     are:

                     o ENABLED  :  S3  build  logs  are enabled for this build
                       project.

                     o DISABLED : S3 build logs are not enabled for this build

                 location -> (string)
                     The  ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3 logs.
                     If your Amazon S3 bucket name is  my-bucket  ,  and  your
                     path  prefix  is  build-log , then acceptable formats are
                     my-bucket/build-log or arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log .

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Set  to  true if you do not want your S3 build log output
                     encrypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies the bucket  owner's  access  for  objects  that
                     another  account  uploads  to  their Amazon S3 bucket. By
                     default, only the account that uploads the objects to the
                     bucket  has access to these objects. This property allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have  the  s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The  bucket  owner  does  not have access to the objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The  bucket  owner has full access to the objects. Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner  pre-
                       ferred  setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The
                       uploading account will have object access as  specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of
                       the objects.

                     For more information about Amazon  S3  object  ownership,
                     see  Controlling  ownership  of uploaded objects using S3

              The number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before  it
              times out.

          buildComplete -> (boolean)
              Whether  the  build  is  complete.  True if complete; otherwise,
              false.

          initiator -> (string)
              The entity that started the build. Valid values include:

              o If CodePipeline started the build, the  pipeline's  name  (for
                example, codepipeline/my-demo-pipeline ).

              o If  an  IAM user started the build, the user's name (for exam-
                ple, MyUserName ).

              o If the Jenkins plugin for CodeBuild  started  the  build,  the
                string CodeBuild-Jenkins-Plugin .

                 You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build out-
                 put artifacts if your service role  has  permission  to  that
                 key.

              You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK
              or,  if  available,  the   CMK's   alias   (using   the   format
              alias/<alias-name> ).

          exportedEnvironmentVariables -> (list)
              A list of exported environment variables for this build.

              Exported  environment  variables  are  used  in conjunction with
              CodePipeline to export environment variables  from  the  current
              build  stage  to  subsequent  stages  in  the pipeline. For more
              information, see Working with variables in the CodePipeline User
              Guide .

                 User Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     During a build, the value  of  a  variable  is  available
                     starting  with  the  install  phase.  It  can  be updated
                     between the start of the install phase and the end of the
                     post_build  phase.  After  the post_build phase ends, the
                     value of exported variables cannot change.

                     created by Amazon EFS. Its format is efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path . You can find the DNS name of file system when
                     you view it in the Amazon EFS console. The directory path
                     is  a  path  to a directory in the file system that Code-
                     Build mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file sys-
                     tem  is fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com , and its
                     mount directory  is  my-efs-mount-directory  ,  then  the
                     location       is       fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazon-
                     aws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory .

                     The directory path  in  the  format  efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path  is optional. If you do not specify a directory
                     path, the location is only the  DNS  name  and  CodeBuild
                     mounts the entire file system.

                 mountPoint -> (string)
                     The  location  in  the container where you mount the file
                     system.

                 identifier -> (string)
                     The name used to access a file system created  by  Amazon
                     EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by append-
                     ing the identifier in all capital letters to CODEBUILD_ .
                     For example, if you specify my_efs for identifier , a new
                     environment variable is create named CODEBUILD_MY_EFS .

                     The identifier is used to mount your file system.

                 mountOptions -> (string)
                     The mount options for a file  system  created  by  Amazon
                     EFS.  The  default  mount  options  used by CodeBuild are
                     nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2
                     . For more information, see Recommended NFS Mount Options
                     .

          debugSession -> (structure)
              Contains information about the debug session for this build.

              sessionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies if session debugging is enabled for this build.

              sessionTarget -> (string)
                 Contains the identifier of the Session Manager  session  used
                 for  the  build. To work with the paused build, you open this
                 session to examine, control, and resume the build.

          buildBatchArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the batch build that this build is a  member  of,  if
              applicable.



                                                                 RETRY-BUILD()
