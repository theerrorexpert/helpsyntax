LIST-BUILDS-FOR-PROJECT()                            LIST-BUILDS-FOR-PROJECT()



NAME
       list-builds-for-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a list of build identifiers for the specified build project, with
       each build identifier representing a single build.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-builds-for-project is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ids

SYNOPSIS
            list-builds-for-project
          --project-name <value>
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the CodeBuild project.

       --sort-order (string)
          The  order  to  sort the results in. The results are sorted by build
          number, not the build identifier. If  this  is  not  specified,  the
          results are sorted in descending order.

          Valid values include:

          o ASCENDING  :  List  the  build  identifiers in ascending order, by
            build number.

          o DESCENDING : List the build identifiers in  descending  order,  by
            build number.

          If the project has more than 100 builds, setting the sort order will
          result in an error.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a list of builds for an AWS CodeBuild build project.

       The following list-builds-for-project example lists the  build  IDs  in
       descending order for the specified CodeBuild build project.

          aws codebuild list-builds-for-project --project-name codebuild-demo-project --sort-order DESCENDING

       Output:

          {
              "ids": [
                  "codebuild-demo-project:1a2b3c4d-5678-90ab-cdef-11111example",
                  "codebuild-demo-project:1a2b3c4d-5678-90ab-cdef-22222example",
                  "codebuild-demo-project:1a2b3c4d-5678-90ab-cdef-33333example",
                  "codebuild-demo-project:1a2b3c4d-5678-90ab-cdef-44444example",
                  "codebuild-demo-project:1a2b3c4d-5678-90ab-cdef-55555example"
              ]
          }

       (AWS CLI) in the AWS CodeBuild User Guide

OUTPUT
       ids -> (list)
          A list of build identifiers for the specified  build  project,  with
          each build ID representing a single build.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  there  are  more  than 100 items in the list, only the first 100
          items are returned, along with a unique string called a nextToken  .
          To  get  the  next  batch  of items in the list, call this operation
          again, adding the next token to the call.
