LIST-REPORTS()                                                  LIST-REPORTS()



NAME
       list-reports -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of ARNs for the reports in the current Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-reports is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: reports

SYNOPSIS
            list-reports
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-order (string)
          Specifies  the  sort  order  for the list of returned reports. Valid
          values are:

          o ASCENDING : return reports in chronological order based  on  their
            creation date.

          o DESCENDING  :  return  reports  in the reverse chronological order
            based on their creation date.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --filter (structure)
          A ReportFilter object used to filter the returned reports.

          status -> (string)
              The status used to filter reports. You can filter using one sta-
              tus only.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "status": "GENERATING"|"SUCCEEDED"|"FAILED"|"INCOMPLETE"|"DELETING"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of the reports for the current account in AWS  CodeBuild.

       The  following  list-reports  example retrieves the ARNs of the reports
       for the current account.

          aws codebuild list-reports

       Output:

          {
              "reports": [
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report ID>",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report ID>",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report ID>"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Working with reports  in  the  AWS  CodeBuild
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          During  a  previous  call,  the  maximum number of items that can be
          returned is the value specified in maxResults . If there more  items
          in the list, then a unique string called a nextToken is returned. To
          get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation  again,
          adding  the  next  token to the call. To get all of the items in the
          list, keep calling this operation with each  subsequent  next  token
          that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

       reports -> (list)
          The  list of returned ARNs for the reports in the current Amazon Web
          Services account.
