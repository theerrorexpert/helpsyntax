NAME
       disassociate-drt-log-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the Shield Response Team's (SRT) access to the specified Amazon
       S3 bucket containing the logs that you shared previously.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-drt-log-bucket
          --log-bucket <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-bucket (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the logs that you want to  share.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  remove  the  authorization for DRT to access an Amazon S3 bucket on
       your behalf

       The following disassociate-drt-log-bucket example removes the  associa-
       tion  between  the  DRT and the specified S3 bucket. After this command
       completes, the DRT can no longer access the bucket  on  behalf  of  the
       account.

          aws shield disassociate-drt-log-bucket \
