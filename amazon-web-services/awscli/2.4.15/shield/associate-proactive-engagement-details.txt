SYNOPSIS
            associate-proactive-engagement-details
          --emergency-contact-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --emergency-contact-list (list)
          A list of email addresses and phone numbers that the Shield Response
          Team  (SRT) can use to contact you for escalations to the SRT and to
          initiate proactive customer support.

          To enable proactive engagement, the contact  list  must  include  at
          least one phone number.

          NOTE:
              The  contacts  that  you  provide here replace any contacts that
              were already defined. If you already have contacts  defined  and
              want  to use them, retrieve the list using DescribeEmergencyCon-
              tactSettings and then provide it here.

          (structure)
              Contact information that the SRT can use to contact you  if  you
              have  proactive  engagement  enabled, for escalations to the SRT
              and to initiate proactive customer support.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The email address for the contact.

              PhoneNumber -> (string)
                 The phone number for the contact.

              ContactNotes -> (string)
                 Additional notes regarding the contact.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EmailAddress=string,PhoneNumber=string,ContactNotes=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EmailAddress": "string",
              "PhoneNumber": "string",
              "ContactNotes": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
