NAME
       associate-drt-log-bucket -

DESCRIPTION

       zon S3 bucket containing log data such  as  Application  Load  Balancer
       access logs, CloudFront logs, or logs from third party sources. You can
       associate up to 10 Amazon S3 buckets with your subscription.

       To use the services  of  the  SRT  and  make  an  AssociateDRTLogBucket
       request,  you  must  be  subscribed to the Business Support plan or the
       Enterprise Support plan .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-drt-log-bucket
          --log-bucket <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-bucket (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the logs that you want to  share.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To authorize the DRT to access an Amazon S3 bucket

       The  following  associate-drt-log-bucket example creates an association
       between the DRT and the specified S3 bucket. This permits  the  DRT  to
       access the bucket on behalf of the account.:

          aws shield associate-drt-log-bucket \
              --log-bucket flow-logs-for-website-lb

       This command produces no output.

       Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
