       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-protection-groups
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          When  you  request  a  list  of objects from Shield Advanced, if the
          response does not include all of the  remaining  available  objects,
          Shield  Advanced includes a NextToken value in the response. You can
          retrieve the next batch of objects by requesting the list again  and
          providing  the  token  that  was  returned by the prior call in your
          request.

          You can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want  Shield
          Advanced  to  return  for a single call with the MaxResults setting.
          Shield Advanced will not return more than  MaxResults  objects,  but
          may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

          Whenever  more  objects  remain  that  Shield  Advanced  has not yet
          returned to you, the response will include a NextToken value.

          On your first call to a list operation, leave this setting empty.

       --max-results (integer)
          The greatest number of objects that  you  want  Shield  Advanced  to
          return  to  the  list  request.  Shield  Advanced might return fewer
          objects than you indicate in this setting, even if more objects  are
          available. If there are more objects remaining, Shield Advanced will
          always also return a NextToken value in the response.

          The default setting is 20.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProtectionGroups -> (list)
          (structure)
              A grouping of protected resources that you and  Shield  Advanced
              can monitor as a collective. This resource grouping improves the
              accuracy of detection and reduces false positives.

              ProtectionGroupId -> (string)
                 The name of the protection group. You use  this  to  identify
                 the  protection  group  in lists and to manage the protection
                 group, for example to update, delete, or describe it.

              Aggregation -> (string)
                 Defines how Shield combines resource data for  the  group  in
                 order to detect, mitigate, and report events.

                 o Sum  -  Use  the  total traffic across the group. This is a
                   good choice for most cases.  Examples  include  Elastic  IP
                   addresses for EC2 instances that scale manually or automat-
                   ically.

                 o Mean - Use the average of the  traffic  across  the  group.
                   This is a good choice for resources that share traffic uni-
                   formly. Examples include accelerators and load balancers.

                 o Max - Use the highest traffic from each resource.  This  is
                   useful  for  resources  that  don't  share  traffic and for
                   resources that share that traffic  in  a  non-uniform  way.
                   Examples include Amazon CloudFront distributions and origin
                   resources for CloudFront distributions.

              Pattern -> (string)
                 The criteria to use to choose  the  protected  resources  for
                 inclusion  in  the  group. You can include all resources that
                 have protections, provide a list of resource Amazon  Resource
                 Names  (ARNs),  or  include  all  resources  of  a  specified
                 resource type.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type to include in  the  protection  group.  All
                 protected  resources of this type are included in the protec-
                 tion group. You  must  set  this  when  you  set  Pattern  to
                 BY_RESOURCE_TYPE  and  you must not set it for any other Pat-
                 tern setting.

              Members -> (list)
                 The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to  include
                 in  the protection group. You must set this when you set Pat-
                 tern to ARBITRARY and you must not set it for any other  Pat-
                 tern setting.

                 (string)

              ProtectionGroupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the protection group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          When  you  request  a  list  of objects from Shield Advanced, if the
          response does not include all of the  remaining  available  objects,
          Shield  Advanced includes a NextToken value in the response. You can
          retrieve the next batch of objects by requesting the list again  and
          providing  the  token  that  was  returned by the prior call in your
          request.

          You can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want  Shield
          Advanced  to  return  for a single call with the MaxResults setting.
          Shield Advanced will not return more than  MaxResults  objects,  but
          may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

          Whenever  more  objects  remain  that  Shield  Advanced  has not yet
          returned to you, the response will include a NextToken value.
