CREATE-PROTECTION-GROUP()                            CREATE-PROTECTION-GROUP()



NAME
       create-protection-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  grouping of protected resources so they can be handled as a
       collective. This resource grouping improves the accuracy  of  detection
       and reduces false positives.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-protection-group
          --protection-group-id <value>
          --aggregation <value>
          --pattern <value>
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--members <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --protection-group-id (string)
          The  name of the protection group. You use this to identify the pro-
          tection group in lists and to manage the protection group, for exam-
          ple to update, delete, or describe it.

       --aggregation (string)
          Defines  how Shield combines resource data for the group in order to
          detect, mitigate, and report events.

          o Sum - Use the total traffic across  the  group.  This  is  a  good
            choice  for  most cases. Examples include Elastic IP addresses for
            EC2 instances that scale manually or automatically.

          o Mean - Use the average of the traffic across the group. This is  a
            good  choice  for resources that share traffic uniformly. Examples
            include accelerators and load balancers.

          o Max - Use the highest traffic from each resource. This  is  useful
            for  resources  that  don't  share  traffic and for resources that
            share that traffic in a non-uniform way. Examples  include  Amazon
            CloudFront and origin resources for CloudFront distributions.

          Possible values:

          o SUM

          o MEAN

          o MAX

       --pattern (string)
          The  criteria to use to choose the protected resources for inclusion
          in the group. You can include all resources that  have  protections,
          provide  a list of resource Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), or include
          all resources of a specified resource type.

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o ARBITRARY

          o BY_RESOURCE_TYPE

       --resource-type (string)
          The resource type to include in the protection group. All  protected
          resources  of  this type are included in the protection group. Newly
          protected resources of this type  are  automatically  added  to  the
          group.  You  must  set this when you set Pattern to BY_RESOURCE_TYPE
          and you must not set it for any other Pattern setting.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION

          o ROUTE_53_HOSTED_ZONE

          o ELASTIC_IP_ALLOCATION

          o CLASSIC_LOAD_BALANCER

          o APPLICATION_LOAD_BALANCER

          o GLOBAL_ACCELERATOR

       --members (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to include in  the
          protection  group.  You  must set this when you set Pattern to ARBI-
          TRARY and you must not set it for any other Pattern setting.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          One or more tag key-value pairs for the protection group.

          (structure)
              A tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags  are
              key:value  pairs  that you can use to categorize and manage your
              resources, for purposes like billing or other management.  Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment",
              and the tag value represents a specific value within that  cate-
              gory,  such  as  "test,"  "development," or "production". Or you
              might set the tag key to "customer" and the value  to  the  cus-
              tomer  name  or  ID.  You can specify one or more tags to add to
              each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
