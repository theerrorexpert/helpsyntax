UPDATE-PROTECTION-GROUP()                            UPDATE-PROTECTION-GROUP()



NAME
       update-protection-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an existing protection group. A protection group is a grouping
       of protected resources so they can be handled  as  a  collective.  This
       resource  grouping improves the accuracy of detection and reduces false
       positives.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-protection-group
          --protection-group-id <value>
          --aggregation <value>
          --pattern <value>
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--members <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --protection-group-id (string)
          The name of the protection group. You use this to identify the  pro-
          tection group in lists and to manage the protection group, for exam-
          ple to update, delete, or describe it.

       --aggregation (string)
          Defines how Shield combines resource data for the group in order  to
          detect, mitigate, and report events.

          o Sum  -  Use  the  total  traffic  across the group. This is a good
            choice for most cases. Examples include Elastic IP  addresses  for
            EC2 instances that scale manually or automatically.

          o Mean  - Use the average of the traffic across the group. This is a
            good choice for resources that share traffic  uniformly.  Examples
            include accelerators and load balancers.

          o Max  -  Use the highest traffic from each resource. This is useful
            for resources that don't share  traffic  and  for  resources  that
            share  that  traffic in a non-uniform way. Examples include Amazon
            CloudFront distributions and origin resources for CloudFront  dis-
            tributions.

          Possible values:

          o SUM

          o MEAN

          o MAX

       --pattern (string)
          The  criteria to use to choose the protected resources for inclusion
          in the group. You can include all resources that  have  protections,
          provide  a list of resource Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), or include
          all resources of a specified resource type.

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o ARBITRARY

          o BY_RESOURCE_TYPE

       --resource-type (string)
          The resource type to include in the protection group. All  protected
          resources  of  this  type  are included in the protection group. You
          must set this when you set Pattern to BY_RESOURCE_TYPE and you  must
          not set it for any other Pattern setting.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION

          o ROUTE_53_HOSTED_ZONE

          o ELASTIC_IP_ALLOCATION

          o CLASSIC_LOAD_BALANCER

          o APPLICATION_LOAD_BALANCER

          o GLOBAL_ACCELERATOR

       --members (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to include in the
          protection group. You must set this when you set  Pattern  to  ARBI-
          TRARY and you must not set it for any other Pattern setting.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
