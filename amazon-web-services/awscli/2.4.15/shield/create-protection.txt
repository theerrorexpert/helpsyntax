CREATE-PROTECTION()                                        CREATE-PROTECTION()



NAME
       create-protection -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  Shield  Advanced  for a specific Amazon Web Services resource.
       The resource can be an Amazon  CloudFront  distribution,  Elastic  Load
       Balancing  load  balancer,  Global  Accelerator accelerator, Elastic IP
       Address, or an Amazon Route 53 hosted zone.

       You can add protection to only a single resource with  each  CreatePro-
       tection  request.  You can add protection to multiple resources at once
       through       the       Shield        Advanced        console        at
       https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/  . For more information
       see Getting Started with Shield Advanced  and  Adding  Shield  Advanced
       protection to Amazon Web Services resources .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-protection
          --name <value>
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Friendly name for the Protection you are creating.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the resource to be protected.

          The ARN should be in one of the following formats:

          o For an Application Load Balancer:
            ``
            arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region      :account-id     :loadbal-
            ancer/app/load-balancer-name /load-balancer-id ``

          o For an Elastic Load Balancer (Classic Load Balancer):
            ``
            arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region     :account-id      :loadbal-
            ancer/load-balancer-name ``

          o For an Amazon CloudFront distribution:
            ``
            arn:aws:cloudfront::account-id :distribution/distribution-id ``

          o For an Global Accelerator accelerator:
            ``
            arn:aws:globalaccelerator::account-id  :accelerator/accelerator-id
            ``

          o For Amazon Route 53:
            ``
            arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted-zone-id ``

          o For an Elastic IP address:
            ``
            arn:aws:ec2:region :account-id :eip-allocation/allocation-id ``

       --tags (list)
          One or more tag key-value pairs for the  Protection object  that  is
          created.

          (structure)
              A  tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags are
              key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and  manage  your
              resources,  for purposes like billing or other management. Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment",
              and  the tag value represents a specific value within that cate-
              gory, such as "test," "development,"  or  "production".  Or  you
              might  set  the  tag key to "customer" and the value to the cus-
              tomer name or ID. You can specify one or more  tags  to  add  to
              each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use  a
                 tag  key to describe a category of information, such as "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use  a
                 tag  value  to  describe  a specific value within a category,
                 such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are  case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable AWS Shield Advanced protection for a single AWS resource

       The following create-protection example enables Shield Advanced protec-
       tion for the specified AWS CloudFront distribution.

          aws shield create-protection \
              --name "Protection for CloudFront distribution" \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/E198WC25FXOWY8

       Output:

          {
              "ProtectionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For more information, see Specify Your Resources to Protect in the  AWS
       Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ProtectionId -> (string)
          The  unique  identifier (ID) for the  Protection object that is cre-
          ated.
