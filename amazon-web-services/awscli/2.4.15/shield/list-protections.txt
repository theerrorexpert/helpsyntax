LIST-PROTECTIONS()                                          LIST-PROTECTIONS()



NAME
       list-protections -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all  Protection objects for the account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-protections  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Protections

SYNOPSIS
            list-protections
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve protection summaries from AWS Shield Advanced

       The  following list-protections example retrieves summaries of the pro-
       tections that are enabled for the account.

          aws shield list-protections

       Output:

          {
              "Protections": [
                  {
                      "Id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "Name": "Protection for CloudFront distribution",
                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/E198WC25FXOWY8"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Protections -> (list)
          The array of enabled  Protection objects.

          (structure)
              An  object that represents a resource that is under DDoS protec-
              tion.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the protection.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the protection. For example, My  CloudFront  dis-
                 tributions .

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  (Amazon  Resource  Name) of the Amazon Web Services
                 resource that is protected.

              HealthCheckIds -> (list)
                 The unique identifier (ID) for  the  Route  53  health  check
                 that's associated with the protection.

                 (string)

              ProtectionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the protection.

              ApplicationLayerAutomaticResponseConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  automatic application layer DDoS mitigation settings for
                 the protection. This configuration determines whether  Shield
                 Advanced  automatically manages rules in the web ACL in order
                 to respond to application layer events that  Shield  Advanced
                 determines to be DDoS attacks.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Indicates  whether automatic application layer DDoS miti-
                     gation is enabled for the protection.

                 Action -> (structure)
                     Specifies the action setting that Shield Advanced  should
                     use  in  the  WAF  rules that it creates on behalf of the
                     protected resource in response to DDoS attacks. You spec-
                     ify  this  as part of the configuration for the automatic
                     application  layer  DDoS  mitigation  feature,  when  you
                     enable  or  update  automatic mitigation. Shield Advanced
                     creates the WAF rules in a Shield  Advanced-managed  rule
                     group,  inside  the web ACL that you have associated with
                     the resource.

                     Block -> (structure)
                        Specifies that Shield Advanced  should  configure  its
                        WAF rules with the WAF Block action.

                        You  must  specify exactly one action, either Block or
                        Count .

                     Count -> (structure)
                        Specifies that Shield Advanced  should  configure  its
                        WAF rules with the WAF Count action.

                        You  must  specify exactly one action, either Block or
                        Count .

       NextToken -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects  from  Shield  Advanced,  if  the
          response  does  not  include all of the remaining available objects,
          Shield Advanced includes a NextToken value in the response. You  can
          retrieve  the next batch of objects by requesting the list again and
          providing the token that was returned by  the  prior  call  in  your
          request.

          You  can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want Shield
          Advanced to return for a single call with  the  MaxResults  setting.
          Shield  Advanced  will  not return more than MaxResults objects, but
          may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

          Whenever more objects  remain  that  Shield  Advanced  has  not  yet
          returned to you, the response will include a NextToken value.
