LIST-ATTACKS()                                                  LIST-ATTACKS()



NAME
       list-attacks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns all ongoing DDoS attacks or all DDoS attacks during a specified
       time period.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-attacks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: AttackSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-attacks
          [--resource-arns <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arns (list)
          The  ARNs  (Amazon  Resource  Names)  of  the  resources  that  were
          attacked. If you leave this blank, all applicable resources for this
          account will be included.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --start-time (structure)
          The  start  of  the time period for the attacks. This is a timestamp
          type. The request syntax listing for this call  indicates  a  number
          type,  but  you  can  provide the time in any valid timestamp format
          setting.

          FromInclusive -> (timestamp)
              The start time, in Unix time in seconds.

          ToExclusive -> (timestamp)
              The end time, in Unix time in seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromInclusive=timestamp,ToExclusive=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromInclusive": timestamp,
            "ToExclusive": timestamp
          }

       --end-time (structure)
          The end of the time period for the  attacks.  This  is  a  timestamp
          type.  The  request  syntax listing for this call indicates a number
          type, but you can provide the time in  any  valid  timestamp  format
          setting.

          FromInclusive -> (timestamp)
              The start time, in Unix time in seconds.

          ToExclusive -> (timestamp)
              The end time, in Unix time in seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromInclusive=timestamp,ToExclusive=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromInclusive": timestamp,
            "ToExclusive": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve attack summaries from AWS Shield Advanced

       The following list-attacks example retrieves summaries of  attacks  for
       the  specified  AWS  CloudFront  distribution during the specified time
       period. The response includes attack IDs that you can  provide  to  the
       describe-attack command for detailed information on an attack.

              --start-time FromInclusive=1529280000,ToExclusive=1529300000

       Output:

              ]
          }

       NextToken -> (string)
          When  you  request  a  list  of objects from Shield Advanced, if the
          response does not include all of the  remaining  available  objects,
          Shield  Advanced includes a NextToken value in the response. You can
          retrieve the next batch of objects by requesting the list again  and
          providing  the  token  that  was  returned by the prior call in your
          request.

          You can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want  Shield
          Advanced  to  return  for a single call with the MaxResults setting.
          Shield Advanced will not return more than  MaxResults  objects,  but
          may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

          Whenever  more  objects  remain  that  Shield  Advanced  has not yet
          returned to you, the response will include a NextToken value.
