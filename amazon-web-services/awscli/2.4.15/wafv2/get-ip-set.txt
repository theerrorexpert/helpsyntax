GET-IP-SET()                                                      GET-IP-SET()



NAME
       get-ip-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the specified  IPSet .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ip-set
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an IPSet after
          you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  set.  This  ID  is  returned in the
          responses to create and list commands. You provide it to  operations
          like update and delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a specific IP set

       The  following get-ip-set retrieves the IP set with the specified name,
       scope, and ID. You can get the ID for an IP set from the commands  cre-
       ate-ip-set and list-ip-sets.

          aws wafv2 get-ip-set \
              --name testip \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "IPSet":{
                  "Description":"",
                  "Name":"testip",
                  "IPAddressVersion":"IPV4",
                  "Id":"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE1111",
                  "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/ipset/testip/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE1111",
                  "Addresses":[
                      "192.0.2.0/16"
                  ]
              },
              "LockToken":"447e55ac-2396-4c6d-b9f9-86b67c17f8b5"
          }

OUTPUT
       IPSet -> (structure)
          Name -> (string)
              The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of  an  IPSet
              after you create it.

          Id -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier  for  the  set. This ID is returned in the
              responses to create and list commands. You provide it to  opera-
              tions like update and delete.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the IP set that helps with identification.

          IPAddressVersion -> (string)
              The version of the IP addresses, either IPV4 or IPV6 .

          Addresses -> (list)
              Contains  an  array  of  strings  that  specify  one  or more IP
              addresses or blocks of IP addresses  in  Classless  Inter-Domain
              Routing  (CIDR)  notation.  WAF  supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR
              ranges except for /0.

              Examples:

              o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that orig-
                inated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32 .

              o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that orig-
                inated  from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, spec-
                ify 192.0.2.0/24 .

              o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that orig-
                inated          from          the          IP          address
                1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111,               specify
                1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128 .

              o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that orig-
                inated             from              IP              addresses
                1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000                     to
                1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff,               specify
                1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64 .

              entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

              (string)

       LockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and  list  requests,  to mark the state of the entity at the time of
          the request. To make changes  to  the  entity  associated  with  the
          token,  you provide the token to operations like update and delete .
          WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made  to  the
          entity  since  you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the
          update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException .  If  this  happens,
          perform  another get , and use the new token returned by that opera-
          tion.
