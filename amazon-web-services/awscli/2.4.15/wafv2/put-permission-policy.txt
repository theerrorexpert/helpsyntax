SYNOPSIS
            put-permission-policy
          --resource-arn <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RuleGroup to which  you  want
          to attach the policy.

       --policy (string)
          The policy to attach to the specified rule group.

          The policy specifications must conform to the following:

          o The policy must be composed using IAM Policy version 2012-10-17 or
            version 2015-01-01.

          o The policy must include specifications for Effect , Action  ,  and
            Principal .

          o Effect must specify Allow .

          o Action  must specify wafv2:CreateWebACL , wafv2:UpdateWebACL , and
            wafv2:PutFirewallManagerRuleGroups . WAF rejects any extra actions
            or wildcard actions in the policy.

          o The policy must not include a Resource parameter.

          For more information, see IAM Policies .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
