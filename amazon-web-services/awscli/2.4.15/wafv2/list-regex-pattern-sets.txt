LIST-REGEX-PATTERN-SETS()                            LIST-REGEX-PATTERN-SETS()



NAME
       list-regex-pattern-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  an  array  of   RegexPatternSetSummary objects for the regex
       pattern sets that you manage.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-regex-pattern-sets
          --scope <value>
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber of objects that are still available for  retrieval  exceeds  the
          limit,  WAF  returns a NextMarker value in the response. To retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number of objects that you want WAF to return for this
          request. If more objects are available, in the  response,  WAF  pro-
          vides  a  NextMarker  value that you can use in a subsequent call to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of regex pattern sets

       The following list-regex-pattern-sets retrieves all regex pattern  sets
       for the account that are defined in the region us-west-2.

          aws wafv2 list-regex-pattern-sets \
          --scope REGIONAL \
          --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "NextMarker":"regexPatterSet01",
              "RegexPatternSets":[
                  {
                      "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/regexpatternset/regexPatterSet01/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "Description":"Test web-acl",
                      "Name":"regexPatterSet01",
                      "LockToken":"f17743f7-0000-0000-0000-19a8b93bfb01",
                      "Id":"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       RegexPatternSets -> (list)
          (structure)
              High-level information about a  RegexPatternSet  ,  returned  by
              operations  like create and list. This provides information like
              the ID, that you can use to  retrieve  and  manage  a  RegexPat-
              ternSet  , and the ARN, that you provide to the  RegexPatternSe-
              tReferenceStatement to use the pattern set in a  Rule .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the data type instance.  You  cannot  change  the
                 name after you create the instance.

              Id -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the
                 responses to create and list  commands.  You  provide  it  to
                 operations like update and delete.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the set that helps with identification.

              LockToken -> (string)
                 A  token  used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to
                 your get and list requests, to mark the state of  the  entity
                 at  the  time  of  the request. To make changes to the entity
                 associated with the token, you provide the  token  to  opera-
                 tions  like  update and delete . WAF uses the token to ensure
                 that no changes have been made to the entity since  you  last
                 retrieved  it.  If  a  change has been made, the update fails
                 with a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,  perform
                 another  get  , and use the new token returned by that opera-
                 tion.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
