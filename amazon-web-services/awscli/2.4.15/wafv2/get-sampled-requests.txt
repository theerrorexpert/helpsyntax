GET-SAMPLED-REQUESTS()                                  GET-SAMPLED-REQUESTS()



NAME
       get-sampled-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  detailed information about a specified number of requests--a sam-
       ple--that WAF randomly selects from among the first 5,000 requests that
       your Amazon Web Services resource received during a time range that you
       choose. You can specify a sample size of up to 500  requests,  and  you
       can specify any time range in the previous three hours.
          GetSampledRequests  returns  a time range, which is usually the time
          range that you specified. However,  if  your  resource  (such  as  a
          CloudFront  distribution)  received 5,000 requests before the speci-
          fied time range elapsed, GetSampledRequests returns an updated  time
          range.  This new time range indicates the actual period during which
          WAF selected the requests in the sample.

SYNOPSIS
            get-sampled-requests
          --web-acl-arn <value>
          --rule-metric-name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --time-window <value>
          --max-items <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --web-acl-arn (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the WebACL for which  you  want  a
          sample of requests.

       --rule-metric-name (string)
          The metric name assigned to the Rule or RuleGroup for which you want
          a sample of requests.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --time-window (structure)
          The  start  date and time and the end date and time of the range for
          which you want GetSampledRequests to return a  sample  of  requests.
          You  must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for-
          mat. UTC format includes the special designator, Z  .  For  example,
          "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can specify any time range in the previous
          three hours. If you specify a start time that's earlier  than  three
          hours ago, WAF sets it to three hours ago.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The  beginning  of the time range from which you want GetSample-
              dRequests to return a sample of the requests  that  your  Amazon
              Web  Services  resource  received. You must specify the times in
              Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the
              special  designator,  Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You
              can specify any time range in the previous three hours.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The end of the time range from which you want GetSampledRequests
              to return a sample of the requests that your Amazon Web Services
              resource received. You must specify  the  times  in  Coordinated
              Universal  Time  (UTC)  format.  UTC format includes the special
              designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can spec-
              ify any time range in the previous three hours.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartTime=timestamp,EndTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StartTime": timestamp,
            "EndTime": timestamp
          }

       --max-items (long)
          The  number  of  requests that you want WAF to return from among the
          first 5,000 requests that your Amazon Web Services resource received
          during the time range. If your resource received fewer requests than
          the value of MaxItems , GetSampledRequests returns information about
          all of them.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

OUTPUT
       SampledRequests -> (list)
          A  complex type that contains detailed information about each of the
          requests in the sample.

          (structure)
              Represents a single sampled web request. The response from  Get-
              SampledRequests includes a SampledHTTPRequests complex type that
              appears as SampledRequests  in  the  response  syntax.  Sampled-
              HTTPRequests contains an array of SampledHTTPRequest objects.

              Request -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type that contains detailed information about the
                 request.

                 ClientIP -> (string)
                     The IP address that the request originated from.  If  the
                     web  ACL  is  associated  with a CloudFront distribution,
                     this is the value of  one  of  the  following  fields  in
                     CloudFront access logs:

                 Country -> (string)
                     The  two-letter  country  code  for  the country that the
                     request originated from. For a current  list  of  country
                     codes, see the Wikipedia entry ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 .

                 URI -> (string)
                     The  URI  path  of  the  request,  which  identifies  the

                 Method -> (string)
                     The HTTP method specified in the sampled web request.

                 HTTPVersion -> (string)
                     The HTTP version specified in the  sampled  web  request,
                     for example, HTTP/1.1 .

                 Headers -> (list)
                     A  complex type that contains the name and value for each
                     header in the sampled web request.

                     (structure)
                        Part of the response from  GetSampledRequests  .  This
                        is  a  complex  type  that  appears  as Headers in the
                        response syntax. HTTPHeader  contains  the  names  and
                        values of all of the headers that appear in one of the
                        web requests.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the HTTP header.

                        Value -> (string)

              Weight -> (long)
                 A value that indicates how one result in the response relates
                 proportionally to other results in the response. For example,
                 a result that has a weight of 2 represents roughly  twice  as
                 many web requests as a result that has a weight of 1 .

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  at which WAF received the request from your Amazon
                 Web Services resource, in Unix time format (in seconds).

              Action -> (string)
                 The action for the Rule that the  request  matched:  Allow  ,
                 Block , or Count .

              RuleNameWithinRuleGroup -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the Rule that the request matched. For managed
                 rule groups, the format for this name is <vendor  name>#<man-
                 aged rule group name>#<rule name> . For your own rule groups,
                 the format for this name is <rule group name>#<rule  name>  .
                 If the rule is not in a rule group, this field is absent.

              RequestHeadersInserted -> (list)
                 Custom  request  headers  inserted  by  WAF into the request,
                 according to the custom request configuration for the  match-
                 ing rule action.

                 (structure)
                     Part of the response from  GetSampledRequests . This is a
                     complex type that appears as Headers in the response syn-
                     tax.  HTTPHeader  contains the names and values of all of
                     the headers that appear in one of the web requests.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the HTTP header.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the HTTP header.

              ResponseCodeSent -> (integer)
                 The response code that was sent for the request.

              Labels -> (list)
                 Labels applied to the web  request  by  matching  rules.  WAF
                 applies  fully  qualified  labels to matching web requests. A
                 fully qualified label is the concatenation of a label  names-
                 pace  and  a  rule  label.  The  rule's rule group or web ACL
                 defines the label namespace.

                 For           example,            awswaf:111122223333:myRule-
                 Group:testRules:testNS1:testNS2:labelNameA   or   awswaf:man-
                 aged:aws:managed-rule-set:header:encoding:utf8 .

                 (structure)
                     A single label container. This is used as an element of a
                     label array in multiple contexts, for example, in RuleLa-
                     bels inside a  Rule and  in  Labels  inside  a   Sampled-
                     HTTPRequest .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The label string.

              CaptchaResponse -> (structure)
                 The CAPTCHA response for the request.

                 ResponseCode -> (integer)
                     The  HTTP  response  code  indicating  the  status of the
                     CAPTCHA token in the web request. If the token  is  miss-
                     ing,  invalid,  or  expired,  this code is 405 Method Not
                     Allowed .

                 SolveTimestamp -> (long)
                     The time that the CAPTCHA puzzle was solved for the  sup-
                     plied token.

                 FailureReason -> (string)
                     The  reason for failure, populated when the evaluation of
                     the token fails.

       PopulationSize -> (long)
          The total number of requests from  which  GetSampledRequests  got  a
          sample of MaxItems requests. If PopulationSize is less than MaxItems
          , the sample includes every request that your  Amazon  Web  Services
          resource received during the specified time range.

       TimeWindow -> (structure)
          Usually, TimeWindow is the time range that you specified in the Get-
          SampledRequests  request.  However,  if  your  Amazon  Web  Services
          resource  received  more  than  5,000 requests during the time range
          that you specified in the request,  GetSampledRequests  returns  the
          time  range  for  the first 5,000 requests. Times are in Coordinated
          Universal Time (UTC) format.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The beginning of the time range from which you  want  GetSample-
              dRequests  to  return  a sample of the requests that your Amazon
              Web Services resource received. You must specify  the  times  in
              Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the
              special designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z"  .  You
              can specify any time range in the previous three hours.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The end of the time range from which you want GetSampledRequests
              to return a sample of the requests that your Amazon Web Services
              resource  received.  You  must  specify the times in Coordinated
              Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC  format  includes  the  special
              designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can spec-
              ify any time range in the previous three hours.
