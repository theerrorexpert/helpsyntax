NAME
       get-regex-pattern-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the specified  RegexPatternSet .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-regex-pattern-set
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the set. You cannot change the name after you create the
          set.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  set.  This  ID  is  returned in the
          responses to create and list commands. You provide it to  operations
          like update and delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a specific regex pattern set

       The  following  get-regex-pattern-set  retrieves  the regex pattern set
       with the specified name, scope, region, and ID. You can get the ID  for
       a  regex  pattern  set  from  the commands create-regex-pattern-set and
       list-regex-pattern-sets.

          aws wafv2 get-regex-pattern-set \
              --name regexPatterSet01 \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "RegexPatternSet":{
                  "Description":"Test web-acl",
                  "RegularExpressionList":[
                      {
                          "RegexString":"/[0-9]*/"
                      },
                      {
                          "RegexString":"/[a-z]*/"
                      }
                  ],
                  "Name":"regexPatterSet01",
                  "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/regexpatternset/regexPatterSet01/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "Id":"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
              },
              "LockToken":"c8abf33f-b6fc-46ae-846e-42f994d57b29"
          }

OUTPUT
       RegexPatternSet -> (structure)
          Name -> (string)
              The name of the set. You cannot change the name after you create
              the set.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the set. This  ID  is  returned  in  the
              responses  to create and list commands. You provide it to opera-
              tions like update and delete.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the set that helps with identification.

          RegularExpressionList -> (list)
              The regular expression patterns in the set.

              (structure)
                 A single regular expression. This is  used  in  a   RegexPat-
                 ternSet .

                 RegexString -> (string)
                     The string representing the regular expression.

       LockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To  make  changes  to  the entity associated with the
          token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.
