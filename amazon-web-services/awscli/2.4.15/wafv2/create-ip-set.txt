CREATE-IP-SET()                                                CREATE-IP-SET()



NAME
       create-ip-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  IPSet , which you use to identify web requests that origi-
       nate from specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses. For example,
       if  you're  receiving  a lot of requests from a ranges of IP addresses,
       you can configure WAF to block them using an IPSet that lists those  IP
       addresses.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-ip-set
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --ip-address-version <value>
          --addresses <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an IPSet after
          you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --description (string)
          A description of the IP set that helps with identification.

       --ip-address-version (string)
          The version of the IP addresses, either IPV4 or IPV6 .

          Possible values:

          o IPV4

          o IPV6

       --addresses (list)
          Contains  an  array of strings that specify one or more IP addresses
          or blocks of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain  Routing  (CIDR)
          notation.  WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except for /0.

          Examples:

          o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count  requests  that  origi-
            nated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32 .

          o To  configure  WAF  to allow, block, or count requests that origi-
            nated from IP addresses from  192.0.2.0  to  192.0.2.255,  specify
            192.0.2.0/24 .

          o To  configure  WAF  to allow, block, or count requests that origi-
            nated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111,
            specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128 .

          o To  configure  WAF  to allow, block, or count requests that origi-
            nated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to
            1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff,                   specify
            1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          An array of key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

          (structure)
              A  tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags are
              key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and  manage  your
              resources,  for purposes like billing or other management. Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment",
              and  the tag value represents a specific value within that cate-
              gory, such as "test," "development,"  or  "production".  Or  you
              might  set  the  tag key to "customer" and the value to the cus-
              tomer name or ID. You can specify one or more  tags  to  add  to
              each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

              You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources  that  you  manage
              through  WAF:  web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and regex pattern
              sets. You can't manage or view tags through the WAF console.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use  a
                 tag  key to describe a category of information, such as "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use  a
                 tag  value  to  describe  a specific value within a category,
                 such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are  case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an IP set for use in your web ACLs and rule groups

       The  following  create-ip-set  command  creates an IP set with a single
       address range specification.

          aws wafv2 create-ip-set \
              --name testip \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --ip-address-version IPV4 \
              --addresses 198.51.100.0/16

       Output:

          {
              "Summary":{
                  "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/ipset/testip/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "Description":"",
                  "Name":"testip",
                  "LockToken":"447e55ac-0000-0000-0000-86b67c17f8b5",
                  "Id":"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Summary -> (structure)
          High-level information about an  IPSet , returned by operations like
          create and list. This provides information like the ID, that you can
          use  to retrieve and manage an IPSet , and the ARN, that you provide
          to the  IPSetReferenceStatement to use the address set in a  Rule  .

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an IPSet
              after you create it.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the set. This  ID  is  returned  in  the
              responses  to create and list commands. You provide it to opera-
              tions like update and delete.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the IP set that helps with identification.

          LockToken -> (string)
              A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your
              get  and  list  requests, to mark the state of the entity at the
              time of the request. To make changes to  the  entity  associated
              with  the token, you provide the token to operations like update
              and delete . WAF uses the token to ensure that no  changes  have
              been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change
              has been made, the update fails with  a  WAFOptimisticLockExcep-
              tion  .  If  this happens, perform another get , and use the new
              token returned by that operation.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
