TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  tags  with the specified Amazon Web Services resource. Tags
       are key:value pairs that you can use  to  categorize  and  manage  your
       resources,  for  purposes  like billing. For example, you might set the
       tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You can
       specify  one  or more tags to add to each Amazon Web Services resource,
       up to 50 tags for a resource.

       You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources that you  manage  through
       WAF:  web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and regex pattern sets. You can't
       manage or view tags through the WAF console.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.

       --tags (list)
          An array of key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

          (structure)
              A tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags  are
              key:value  pairs  that you can use to categorize and manage your
              resources, for purposes like billing or other management.  Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment",
              and the tag value represents a specific value within that  cate-
              gory,  such  as  "test,"  "development," or "production". Or you
              might set the tag key to "customer" and the value  to  the  cus-
              tomer  name  or  ID.  You can specify one or more tags to add to
              each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

              You  can  tag  the Amazon Web Services resources that you manage
              through WAF: web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and  regex  pattern
              sets. You can't manage or view tags through the WAF console.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To add tags to an AWS WAF resource

       The following tag-resource example adds a tag with a key  of  Name  and
       value set to AWSWAF to the specified web ACL.

          aws wafv2 tag-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/apiGatewayWebAcl/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --tags Key=Name,Value=AWSWAF

       This command produces no output.
