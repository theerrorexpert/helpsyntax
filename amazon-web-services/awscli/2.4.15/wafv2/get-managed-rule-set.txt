NAME
       get-managed-rule-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the specified managed rule set.

       NOTE:
          This  is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Ven-
          dors are Amazon Web Services and  Amazon  Web  Services  Marketplace
          sellers.

          Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
          rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your cus-
          tomers.  The APIs are ListManagedRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet , Put-
          ManagedRuleSetVersions , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

SYNOPSIS
            get-managed-rule-set
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the rule
          set ID, to identify the rule set.

          This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which
          your customers can access and use.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load  Balancer  (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned  in
          the  responses  to commands like list . You provide it to operations
          like get and update .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ManagedRuleSet -> (structure)
          The managed rule set that you requested.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the managed rule set. You use this, along  with  the
              rule set ID, to identify the rule set.

              This  name  is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group,
              which your customers can access and use.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned
              in the responses to commands like list . You provide it to oper-
              ations like get and update .

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the set that helps with identification.

          PublishedVersions -> (map)
              The versions of this managed rule set that are available for use
              by customers.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Information for a single version of a managed rule set.

                 NOTE:
                     This  is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule
                     sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Marketplace sellers.

                     Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide
                     controlled rollout of your versioned managed  rule  group
                     offerings  for  your  customers. The APIs are ListManage-
                     dRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet , PutManagedRuleSetVersions
                     , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

                 AssociatedRuleGroupArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the vendor rule group
                     that's used to define the published version of your  man-
                     aged rule group.

                 Capacity -> (long)
                     The  web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule
                     group.

                     WAF uses WCUs to  calculate  and  control  the  operating
                     resources  that  are used to run your rules, rule groups,
                     and web ACLs. WAF  calculates  capacity  differently  for
                     each  rule  type,  to  reflect  the relative cost of each
                     rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs
                     than  more  complex rules that use more processing power.
                     Rule group capacity is fixed  at  creation,  which  helps
                     users  plan  their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule
                     group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500.

                 ForecastedLifetime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time you expect this version of  your  man-
                     aged rule group to last, in days.

                 PublishTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The time that you first published this version.

                     Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC
                     format includes the special designator, Z.  For  example,
                     "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

                 LastUpdateTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The last time that you updated this version.

                     Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC
                     format includes the special designator, Z.  For  example,
                     "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

                 ExpiryTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The time that this version is set to expire.

                     Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC
                     format includes the special designator, Z.  For  example,
                     "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

          RecommendedVersion -> (string)
              The version that you would like your customers to use.

          LabelNamespace -> (string)
              The  label namespace prefix for the managed rule groups that are
              offered to customers from this managed rule set. All labels that
              are added by rules in the managed rule group have this prefix.

              o The  syntax  for the label namespace prefix for a managed rule
                group is the following:   awswaf:managed:<vendor>:<rule  group
                name> :

              o When  a  rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the
                fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified  label
                is  made  up of the label namespace from the rule group or web
                ACL where the rule is defined and the  label  from  the  rule,
                separated by a colon:   <label namespace>:<label from rule>

       LockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To  make  changes  to  the entity associated with the
          token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.
