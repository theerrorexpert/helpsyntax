NAME
       list-logging-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves an array of your  LoggingConfiguration objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-logging-configurations
          --scope <value>
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load  Balancer  (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return  for  this
          request.  If  more  objects are available, in the response, WAF pro-
          vides a NextMarker value that you can use in a  subsequent  call  to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of all logging configurations for a region

       The  following  list-logging-configurations  retrieves  the all logging
       configurations for web ACLs that are scoped for  regional  use  in  the
       us-west-2 region.

          aws wafv2 list-logging-configurations \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "LoggingConfigurations":[
                  {
                      "ResourceArn":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/test-2/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",

OUTPUT
       LoggingConfigurations -> (list)
          (structure)
              Defines  an  association  between logging destinations and a web
              ACL resource, for logging from WAF. As part of the  association,
              you can specify parts of the standard logging fields to keep out
              of the logs and you can specify filters so that you log  only  a
              subset of the logging records.

              For  information about configuring web ACL logging destinations,
              see Logging web ACL traffic information  in  the  WAF  Developer
              Guide .

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you want
                 to associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

              LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
                 The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the logging  destinations
                 that you want to associate with the web ACL.

                 (string)

              RedactedFields -> (list)
                 The  parts  of  the  request that you want to keep out of the
                 logs. For example, if you redact the SingleHeader field,  the
                 HEADER field in the logs will be xxx .

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify only the following fields for redaction:
                     UriPath , QueryString , SingleHeader , Method , and Json-
                     Body .

                 (structure)
                     The  part  of a web request that you want WAF to inspect.
                     Include the single FieldToMatch type  that  you  want  to
                     inspect,   with   additional  specifications  as  needed,
                     according to the type. You specify a single request  com-
                     ponent  in  FieldToMatch  for  each  rule  statement that
                     requires it. To inspect more than one component of a  web
                     request, create a separate rule statement for each compo-
                     nent.

                     JSON specification for a QueryString field to match:
                        "FieldToMatch": { "QueryString": {} }

                     Example JSON for a Method field to match specification:
                        "FieldToMatch": { "Method": { "Name": "DELETE" } }

                     SingleHeader -> (structure)
                        Inspect a single  header.  Provide  the  name  of  the
                        header  to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Referer
                        . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                        Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the query header to inspect.

                     SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                        Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name  of
                        the  query  argument  to  inspect, such as UserName or
                        SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30 characters long
                        and isn't case sensitive.

                        This  is  used only to indicate the web request compo-
                        nent for WAF to inspect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-
                        cation.

                        Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {   "Name":
                        "myArgument" }

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the query argument to inspect.

                     AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                        Inspect all query arguments.

                     UriPath -> (structure)
                        Inspect the request URI path. This is the  part  of  a
                        web  request  that identifies a resource, for example,
                        /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                     QueryString -> (structure)
                        Inspect the query string. This is the part  of  a  URL
                        that appears after a ? character, if any.

                     Body -> (structure)
                        Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The request
                        body immediately follows the request headers. This  is
                        the  part  of  a  request that contains any additional
                        data that you want to send to your web server  as  the
                        HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                        Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                        request body are forwarded to WAF  for  inspection  by
                        the  underlying  host  service.  If  you don't need to
                        inspect more than 8 KB, you  can  guarantee  that  you
                        don't  allow additional bytes in by combining a state-
                        ment that inspects the body of the web  request,  such
                        as   ByteMatchStatement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                        tatement  ,  with  a    SizeConstraintStatement   that
                        enforces  an  8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                        request. WAF doesn't  support  inspecting  the  entire
                        contents  of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8 KB
                        limit.

                     Method -> (structure)
                        Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type
                        of  operation that the request is asking the origin to
                        perform.

                     JsonBody -> (structure)
                        Inspect the request body as  JSON.  The  request  body
                        immediately  follows  the request headers. This is the
                        part of a request that contains  any  additional  data
                        that  you  want to send to your web server as the HTTP
                        request body, such as data from a form.

                        Note that only the first 8  KB  (8192  bytes)  of  the
                        request  body  are  forwarded to WAF for inspection by
                        the underlying host service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                        inspect  more  than  8  KB, you can guarantee that you
                        don't allow additional bytes in by combining a  state-
                        ment  that  inspects the body of the web request, such
                        as  ByteMatchStatement or   RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                        tatement   ,   with  a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                        enforces an 8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                        request.  WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting the entire
                        contents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8  KB
                        limit.

                        MatchPattern -> (structure)
                            The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON body. WAF
                            inspects the  results  of  these  pattern  matches
                            against the rule inspection criteria.

                            All -> (structure)
                               Match  all of the elements. See also MatchScope
                               in  JsonBody .

                               You must specify either  this  setting  or  the
                               IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                            IncludedPaths -> (list)
                               Match  only  the  specified  include paths. See
                               also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                               Provide the include paths  using  JSON  Pointer
                               syntax.     For    example,    "IncludedPaths":
                               ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] . For informa-
                               tion  about this syntax, see the Internet Engi-
                               neering   Task   Force   (IETF)   documentation
                               JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                               You must specify either this setting or the All
                               setting, but not both.

                               NOTE:
                                   Don't use this option to include all paths.
                                   Instead, use the All setting.

                               (string)

                        MatchScope -> (string)
                            The  parts  of the JSON to match against using the
                            MatchPattern . If you specify All  ,  WAF  matches
                            against keys and values.

                        InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse
                            the JSON body. The options are the following:

                            o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as  plain
                              text.  WAF  applies the text transformations and
                              inspection criteria that  you  defined  for  the
                              JSON inspection to the body text string.

                            o MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as matching the
                              rule statement. WAF applies the rule  action  to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                            If you don't provide this setting, WAF parses  and
                            evaluates the content only up to the first parsing
                            failure that it encounters.

                            WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON  body,
                            but  might  be  forced to stop for reasons such as
                            invalid characters,  duplicate  keys,  truncation,
                            and any content whose root node isn't an object or
                            an array.

                            WAF parses the JSON in the following  examples  as
                            two valid key, value pairs:

                            o Missing comma: {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                            o Missing colon: {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                            o Extra colons: {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

              ManagedByFirewallManager -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  logging configuration was created by
                 Firewall Manager, as part of an WAF policy configuration.  If
                 true, only Firewall Manager can modify or delete the configu-
                 ration.

              LoggingFilter -> (structure)
                 Filtering that specifies which web requests are kept  in  the
                 logs and which are dropped. You can filter on the rule action
                 and on the web request labels that were applied  by  matching
                 rules during web ACL evaluation.

                 Filters -> (list)
                     The filters that you want to apply to the logs.

                     (structure)
                        A single logging filter, used in  LoggingFilter .

                        Behavior -> (string)
                            How  to handle logs that satisfy the filter's con-
                            ditions and requirement.

                        Requirement -> (string)
                            Logic to apply to the  filtering  conditions.  You
                            can  specify that, in order to satisfy the filter,
                            a log must match all conditions or must  match  at
                            least one condition.

                        Conditions -> (list)
                            Match conditions for the filter.

                            (structure)
                               A single match condition for a  Filter .

                               ActionCondition -> (structure)

                                   Action -> (string)
                                      The  action  setting  that  a log record
                                      must contain in order to meet the condi-
                                      tion.

                               LabelNameCondition -> (structure)
                                   A single label name condition.

                                   LabelName -> (string)
                                      The  label  name  that a log record must
                                      contain in order to meet the  condition.
                                      This  must  be  a  fully qualified label
                                      name. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                                      fix,   optional  namespaces,  and  label
                                      name. The  prefix  identifies  the  rule
                                      group  or  web  ACL  context of the rule
                                      that added the label.

                 DefaultBehavior -> (string)
                     Default handling for logs that don't  match  any  of  the
                     specified filtering conditions.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber of objects that are still available for  retrieval  exceeds  the
          limit,  WAF  returns a NextMarker value in the response. To retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.
