LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()                              LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  TagInfoForResource for the specified resource. Tags are
       key:value pairs  that  you  can  use  to  categorize  and  manage  your
       resources,  for  purposes  like billing. For example, you might set the
       tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You can
       specify  one  or more tags to add to each Amazon Web Services resource,
       up to 50 tags for a resource.

       You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources that you  manage  through
       WAF:  web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and regex pattern sets. You can't
       manage or view tags through the WAF console.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-for-resource
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return  for  this
          request.  If  more  objects are available, in the response, WAF pro-
          vides a NextMarker value that you can use in a  subsequent  call  to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve all tags for an AWS WAF resource

       The following list-tags-for-resource retrieves the list of all tag key,
       value pairs for the specified web ACL.

          aws wafv2 list-tags-for-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/testwebacl2/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "NextMarker":"",
              "TagInfoForResource":{
                  "ResourceARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/testwebacl2/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "TagList":[

                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber of objects that are still available for  retrieval  exceeds  the
          limit,  WAF  returns a NextMarker value in the response. To retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       TagInfoForResource -> (structure)
          The collection of tagging definitions for the resource.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.

          TagList -> (list)
              The array of  Tag objects defined for the resource.

              (structure)
                 A  tag  associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags
                 are key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and manage
                 your  resources,  for  purposes like billing or other manage-
                 ment. Typically, the tag key represents a category,  such  as
                 "environment",  and the tag value represents a specific value
                 within that category, such as "test," "development," or "pro-
                 duction".  Or you might set the tag key to "customer" and the
                 value to the customer name or ID. You can specify one or more
                 tags  to  add  to each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50
                 tags for a resource.

                 You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources that you manage
                 through  WAF:  web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and regex pat-
                 tern sets. You can't manage or view tags through the WAF con-
                 sole.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Part  of  the  key:value pair that defines a tag. You can
                     use a tag key to describe a category of information, such
                     as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Part  of  the  key:value pair that defines a tag. You can
                     use a tag value to describe a  specific  value  within  a
                     category,  such  as  "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values
                     are case-sensitive.
