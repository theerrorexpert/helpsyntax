GET-WEB-ACL-FOR-RESOURCE()                          GET-WEB-ACL-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       get-web-acl-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the  WebACL for the specified resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-web-acl-for-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the resource.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       WebACL -> (structure)
          The web ACL that is associated with the resource.  If  there  is  no
          associated resource, WAF returns a null web ACL.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL
              after you create it.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the WebACL . This ID is returned in  the
              responses  to  create  and  list commands. You use this ID to do
              things like get, update, and delete a WebACL .

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you  want  to
              associate with the resource.

          DefaultAction -> (structure)
              The  action  to  perform  if  none of the Rules contained in the
              WebACL match.

              Block -> (structure)
                 Specifies that WAF should block requests by default.

                 CustomResponse -> (structure)
                     Defines a custom response for the web request.

                     For  information  about  customizing  web  requests   and
                     responses,  see Customizing web requests and responses in
                     WAF in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     ResponseCode -> (integer)
                        The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                        For a list of status codes that you can  use  in  your
                        custom  reqponses, see Supported status codes for cus-
                        tom response in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)
                        References the response body  that  you  want  WAF  to
                        return  to  the  web  request client. You can define a
                        custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL
                        action  that  is  set  to block. To do this, you first
                        define the response body key and value in the  Custom-
                        ResponseBodies  setting  for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup
                        where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action  or
                        web ACL default action BlockAction setting, you refer-
                        ence the response body using this key.

                     ResponseHeaders -> (list)
                        The HTTP headers to use  in  the  response.  Duplicate
                        header names are not allowed.

                        custom request and response settings, see  WAF  quotas
                        in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        (structure)
                            A  custom  header  for custom request and response
                            handling. This  is  used  in   CustomResponse  and
                            CustomRequestHandling .

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the custom header.

                               For  custom  request header insertion, when WAF
                               inserts the header into the  request,  it  pre-
                               fixes  this  name x-amzn-waf- , to avoid confu-
                               sion with the headers that are already  in  the
                               request.  For example, for the header name sam-
                               ple , WAF inserts the header  x-amzn-waf-sample
                               .

                            Value -> (string)
                               The value of the custom header.

              Allow -> (structure)
                 Specifies that WAF should allow requests by default.

                 CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)
                     Defines custom handling for the web request.

                     For   information  about  customizing  web  requests  and
                     responses, see Customizing web requests and responses  in
                     WAF in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     InsertHeaders -> (list)
                        The HTTP headers to insert into the request. Duplicate
                        header names are not allowed.

                        For information about the limits on count and size for
                        custom  request  and response settings, see WAF quotas
                        in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        (structure)
                            A custom header for custom  request  and  response
                            handling.  This  is  used  in   CustomResponse and
                            CustomRequestHandling .

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the custom header.

                               For custom request header insertion,  when  WAF
                               inserts  the  header  into the request, it pre-
                               fixes this name x-amzn-waf- , to  avoid  confu-
                               sion  with  the headers that are already in the
                               request. For example, for the header name  sam-
                               ple  , WAF inserts the header x-amzn-waf-sample
                               .

                            Value -> (string)
                               The value of the custom header.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the web ACL that helps with identification.

          Rules -> (list)
              The  Rule statements used to identify the web requests that  you
              want to allow, block, or count. Each rule includes one top-level
              statement that WAF uses to identify matching web  requests,  and
              parameters that govern how WAF handles them.

              (structure)
                 A  single  rule, which you can use in a  WebACL or  RuleGroup
                 to identify web requests that you want to  allow,  block,  or
                 count.  Each  rule includes one top-level  Statement that WAF
                 uses to identify matching web requests, and  parameters  that
                 govern how WAF handles them.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the rule. You can't change the name of a Rule
                     after you create it.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     If you define more than one Rule in a WebACL , WAF evalu-
                     ates each request against the Rules in order based on the
                     value of Priority . WAF processes rules with lower prior-
                     ity  first.  The priorities don't need to be consecutive,
                     but they must all be different.

                 Statement -> (structure)
                     The WAF processing statement for the  rule,  for  example
                     ByteMatchStatement or  SizeConstraintStatement .

                     ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  that defines a string match search
                        for WAF to apply  to  web  requests.  The  byte  match
                        statement  provides the bytes to search for, the loca-
                        tion in requests that you  want  WAF  to  search,  and
                        other  settings. The bytes to search for are typically
                        a string that corresponds with  ASCII  characters.  In
                        the  WAF console and the developer guide, this is ref-
                        ered to as a string match statement.

                        SearchString -> (blob)
                            A string value that you want WAF  to  search  for.
                            WAF searches only in the part of web requests that
                            you designate for inspection  in   FieldToMatch  .
                            The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.

                            Valid  values  depend  on  the  component that you
                            specify for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                            o Method : The HTTP method that you  want  WAF  to
                              search for. This indicates the type of operation
                              specified in the request.

                            o UriPath : The value that you want WAF to  search
                              for    in    the    URI   path,   for   example,

                            If SearchString includes alphabetic characters A-Z
                            and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
                               If you're using the WAF API

                            Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The
                            maximum   length   of   the   value   before   you
                            base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                            For  example,  suppose the value of Type is HEADER
                            and the value of Data is User-Agent . If you  want
                            to search the User-Agent header for the value Bad-
                            Bot  ,  you  base64-encode   BadBot   using   MIME
                            base64-encoding  and  include the resulting value,
                            QmFkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                               If you're using the CLI or one  of  the  Amazon
                               Web Services SDKs

                            The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK
                            automatically base64 encodes the value.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that  you  want  WAF  to
                            inspect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to  inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of a web request that  identifies  a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body  as  plain  text.  The
                               request  body  immediately  follows the request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF  for
                               inspection  by  the underlying host service. If
                               you don't need to inspect more than 8  KB,  you
                               can  guarantee  that you don't allow additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the  body  of  the web request, such as  ByteM-
                               atchStatement  or    RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of  the
                               request.  WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting the
                               entire contents of web  requests  whose  bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF for
                               inspection by the underlying host  service.  If
                               you  don't  need to inspect more than 8 KB, you
                               can guarantee that you don't  allow  additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the body of the web request,  such  as   ByteM-
                               atchStatement   or   RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces  an 8 KB size limit on the body of the
                               request. WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                               entire  contents  of  web requests whose bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the   Internet  Engineering  Task  Force

                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of  the  JSON  to  match  against
                                   using the MatchPattern . If you specify All
                                   , WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection. If you specify  one
                            or  more  transformations in a rule statement, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request  component  identified  by  FieldToMatch ,
                            starting from the lowest priority setting,  before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations  eliminate  some  of  the
                               unusual formatting that attackers  use  in  web
                               requests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations that are defined  for
                                   a  rule statement. WAF processes all trans-
                                   formations, from lowest priority  to  high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent. The priorities don't need to be  con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You  can  specify the following transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -  Decode  a  Base64
                                      -encoded string,  but  use  a  forgiving
                                      implementation  that  ignores characters
                                      that aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness of attackers who inject an  operat-
                                      ing  system command-line command and use
                                      unusual formatting to disguise  some  or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete  spaces before the following char-

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -  Replace   these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules  syn-
                                      data.html#characters   .  This  function
                                      uses up to two  bytes  in  the  decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters that were encoded  using  CSS
                                      encoding   that   wouldnt  typically  be
                                      encoded. It's also useful in  countering
                                      evasion,  which  is  a  combination of a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters.   For   example,  ja\vascript  for
                                      javascript.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,
                                      \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,
                                      \xHH   (hexadecimal),   \0OOO   (octal).
                                      Encodings that aren't  valid  remain  in
                                      the output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE       -       Replace
                                      HTML-encoded  characters  with unencoded
                                      characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs
                                      these operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a   "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE  -  Decode  JavaScript  escape
                                      sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is  in
                                      the   full-width  ASCII  code  range  of
                                      FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte is used
                                      to  detect and adjust the lower byte. If
                                      not, only the lower byte is used and the
                                      higher  byte is zeroed, causing a possi-
                                      ble loss of information.

                                      LOWERCASE -  Convert  uppercase  letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5  -  Calculate  an  MD5 hash from the
                                      data in the input. The computed hash  is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE  -  Specify  NONE if you don't want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   -    Remove    multiple
                                      slashes,  directory self-references, and
                                      directory back-references that  are  not
                                      at  the  beginning  of the input from an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   ,  but  first  converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive  occurrences  are  not  compressed.
                                      Unterminated comments are also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE  ,  but
                                      with  support  for Microsoft-specific %u
                                      encoding.  If  the  code   is   in   the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                      adjust  the  lower byte. Otherwise, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all  UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps  input normalization, and minimiz-
                                      ing false-positives and  false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                        PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                            The  area within the portion of a web request that
                            you want WAF to search for  SearchString  .  Valid
                            values include the following:
                               CONTAINS

                            The specified part of the web request must include
                            the value  of  SearchString  ,  but  the  location
                            doesn't matter.
                               CONTAINS_WORD

                            The specified part of the web request must include
                            the value of SearchString , and SearchString  must
                            contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore
                            (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In  addition,  SearchString
                            must  be a word, which means that both of the fol-
                            lowing are true:

                            o SearchString is at the beginning of  the  speci-
                              fied part of the web request or is preceded by a
                              character other than an  alphanumeric  character
                              or underscore (_). Examples include the value of
                              a header and ;BadBot .

                            o SearchString is at the end of the specified part
                              of the web request or is followed by a character
                              other than an alphanumeric character  or  under-
                              score (_), for example, BadBot; and -BadBot; .
                               EXACTLY

                            The value of the specified part of the web request
                            must exactly match the value of SearchString .
                               STARTS_WITH

                            The value  of  SearchString  must  appear  at  the
                            beginning   of  the  specified  part  of  the  web
                            request.
                               ENDS_WITH

                            The value of SearchString must appear at  the  end
                            of the specified part of the web request.

                     SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        Attackers sometimes insert malicious SQL code into web
                        requests in an effort to extract data from your  data-
                        base.  To  allow  or block web requests that appear to
                        contain malicious SQL code, create  one  or  more  SQL
                        injection  match  conditions.  An  SQL injection match
                        condition identifies the part of web requests, such as
                        the  URI  or  the  query  string, that you want WAF to
                        inspect. Later in the process, when you create  a  web
                        ACL,  you  specify  whether to allow or block requests
                        that appear to contain malicious SQL code.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that  you  want  WAF  to
                            inspect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to  inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of a web request that  identifies  a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body  as  plain  text.  The
                               request  body  immediately  follows the request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF  for
                               inspection  by  the underlying host service. If
                               you don't need to inspect more than 8  KB,  you
                               can  guarantee  that you don't allow additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the  body  of  the web request, such as  ByteM-
                               atchStatement  or    RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of  the
                               request.  WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting the
                               entire contents of web  requests  whose  bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF for
                               inspection by the underlying host  service.  If
                               you  don't  need to inspect more than 8 KB, you
                               can guarantee that you don't  allow  additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the body of the web request,  such  as   ByteM-

                               enforces  an 8 KB size limit on the body of the
                               request. WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                               entire  contents  of  web requests whose bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of  the  JSON  to  match  against
                                   using the MatchPattern . If you specify All
                                   , WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection. If you specify  one
                            or  more  transformations in a rule statement, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request  component  identified  by  FieldToMatch ,
                            starting from the lowest priority setting,  before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations  eliminate  some  of  the
                               unusual formatting that attackers  use  in  web
                               requests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations that are defined  for
                                   a  rule statement. WAF processes all trans-
                                   formations, from lowest priority  to  high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent. The priorities don't need to be  con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You  can  specify the following transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -  Decode  a  Base64
                                      -encoded string,  but  use  a  forgiving
                                      implementation  that  ignores characters
                                      that aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness of attackers who inject an  operat-
                                      ing  system command-line command and use
                                      unusual formatting to disguise  some  or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete  spaces before the following char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace the following characters  with  a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -  Replace   these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                   o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces  mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules  syn-
                                      data.html#characters   .  This  function
                                      uses up to two  bytes  in  the  decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters that were encoded  using  CSS
                                      encoding   that   wouldnt  typically  be
                                      encoded. It's also useful in  countering
                                      evasion,  which  is  a  combination of a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters.   For   example,  ja\vascript  for
                                      javascript.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,
                                      \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,
                                      \xHH   (hexadecimal),   \0OOO   (octal).
                                      Encodings that aren't  valid  remain  in
                                      the output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE       -       Replace
                                      HTML-encoded  characters  with unencoded
                                      characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs
                                      these operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a   "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE  -  Decode  JavaScript  escape
                                      sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is  in
                                      the   full-width  ASCII  code  range  of
                                      FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte is used
                                      to  detect and adjust the lower byte. If
                                      not, only the lower byte is used and the
                                      higher  byte is zeroed, causing a possi-
                                      ble loss of information.

                                      LOWERCASE -  Convert  uppercase  letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5  -  Calculate  an  MD5 hash from the
                                      data in the input. The computed hash  is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE  -  Specify  NONE if you don't want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   -    Remove    multiple
                                      slashes,  directory self-references, and
                                      directory back-references that  are  not
                                      at  the  beginning  of the input from an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   ,  but  first  converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive  occurrences  are  not  compressed.
                                      Unterminated comments are also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE  ,  but
                                      with  support  for Microsoft-specific %u
                                      encoding.  If  the  code   is   in   the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                      adjust  the  lower byte. Otherwise, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all  UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps  input normalization, and minimiz-
                                      ing false-positives and  false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                     XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement that defines a cross-site scripting
                        (XSS) match search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.
                        XSS attacks are those where the attacker uses vulnera-
                        bilities in a benign website as a  vehicle  to  inject
                        malicious  client-site  scripts  into other legitimate
                        web browsers. The XSS  match  statement  provides  the
                        location  in  requests that you want WAF to search and
                        text transformations to use on the search area  before
                        WAF  searches  for character sequences that are likely
                        to be malicious strings.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that  you  want  WAF  to
                            inspect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to  inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of a web request that  identifies  a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body  as  plain  text.  The
                               request  body  immediately  follows the request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF  for
                               inspection  by  the underlying host service. If
                               you don't need to inspect more than 8  KB,  you
                               can  guarantee  that you don't allow additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the  body  of  the web request, such as  ByteM-
                               atchStatement  or    RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of  the
                               request.  WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting the
                               entire contents of web  requests  whose  bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF for
                               inspection by the underlying host  service.  If
                               you  don't  need to inspect more than 8 KB, you
                               can guarantee that you don't  allow  additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the body of the web request,  such  as   ByteM-
                               atchStatement   or   RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces  an 8 KB size limit on the body of the
                               request. WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                               entire  contents  of  web requests whose bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of  the  JSON  to  match  against
                                   using the MatchPattern . If you specify All
                                   , WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection. If you specify  one
                            or  more  transformations in a rule statement, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request  component  identified  by  FieldToMatch ,
                            starting from the lowest priority setting,  before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations  eliminate  some  of  the
                               unusual formatting that attackers  use  in  web
                               requests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations that are defined  for
                                   a  rule statement. WAF processes all trans-
                                   formations, from lowest priority  to  high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent. The priorities don't need to be  con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You  can  specify the following transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -  Decode  a  Base64
                                      -encoded string,  but  use  a  forgiving
                                      implementation  that  ignores characters
                                      that aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness of attackers who inject an  operat-
                                      ing  system command-line command and use
                                      unusual formatting to disguise  some  or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete  spaces before the following char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace the following characters  with  a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -  Replace   these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                   o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces  mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules  syn-
                                      data.html#characters   .  This  function
                                      uses up to two  bytes  in  the  decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters that were encoded  using  CSS
                                      encoding   that   wouldnt  typically  be
                                      encoded. It's also useful in  countering
                                      evasion,  which  is  a  combination of a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters.   For   example,  ja\vascript  for
                                      javascript.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,
                                      \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,
                                      \xHH   (hexadecimal),   \0OOO   (octal).
                                      Encodings that aren't  valid  remain  in
                                      the output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE       -       Replace
                                      HTML-encoded  characters  with unencoded
                                      characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs
                                      these operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a   "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE  -  Decode  JavaScript  escape
                                      sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is  in
                                      the   full-width  ASCII  code  range  of
                                      FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte is used
                                      to  detect and adjust the lower byte. If
                                      not, only the lower byte is used and the
                                      higher  byte is zeroed, causing a possi-
                                      ble loss of information.

                                      LOWERCASE -  Convert  uppercase  letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5  -  Calculate  an  MD5 hash from the
                                      data in the input. The computed hash  is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE  -  Specify  NONE if you don't want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   -    Remove    multiple
                                      slashes,  directory self-references, and
                                      directory back-references that  are  not
                                      at  the  beginning  of the input from an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   ,  but  first  converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive  occurrences  are  not  compressed.
                                      Unterminated comments are also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE  ,  but
                                      with  support  for Microsoft-specific %u
                                      encoding.  If  the  code   is   in   the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                      adjust  the  lower byte. Otherwise, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all  UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps  input normalization, and minimiz-
                                      ing false-positives and  false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                     SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  that  compares  a  number of bytes
                        against the size of a request component, using a  com-
                        parison  operator,  such  as  greater than (>) or less
                        than (<). For example, you can use a  size  constraint
                        statement  to  look  for query strings that are longer
                        than 100 bytes.

                        If you configure WAF to inspect the request body,  WAF
                        inspects  only  the  first  8192  bytes (8 KB). If the
                        request body for your web requests never exceeds  8192
                        bytes,  you can create a size constraint condition and
                        block requests that have a request body  greater  than
                        8192 bytes.

                        If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request
                        to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts  as  one
                        character.  For  example,  the  URI  /logo.jpg is nine
                        characters long.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that  you  want  WAF  to
                            inspect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to  inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of a web request that  identifies  a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body  as  plain  text.  The
                               request  body  immediately  follows the request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF  for
                               inspection  by  the underlying host service. If
                               you don't need to inspect more than 8  KB,  you
                               can  guarantee  that you don't allow additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the  body  of  the web request, such as  ByteM-
                               atchStatement  or    RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of  the
                               request.  WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting the
                               entire contents of web  requests  whose  bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF for
                               inspection by the underlying host  service.  If
                               you  don't  need to inspect more than 8 KB, you
                               can guarantee that you don't  allow  additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the body of the web request,  such  as   ByteM-
                               atchStatement   or   RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces  an 8 KB size limit on the body of the
                               request. WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                               entire  contents  of  web requests whose bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the   Internet  Engineering  Task  Force

                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of  the  JSON  to  match  against
                                   using the MatchPattern . If you specify All
                                   , WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                            The operator to use to compare the request part to
                            the size setting.

                        Size -> (long)
                            The size, in byte, to compare to the request part,
                            after any transformations.

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection. If you specify  one
                            or  more  transformations in a rule statement, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request  component  identified  by  FieldToMatch ,
                            starting from the lowest priority setting,  before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations  eliminate  some  of  the
                               unusual formatting that attackers  use  in  web
                               requests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations that are defined  for
                                   a  rule statement. WAF processes all trans-
                                   formations, from lowest priority  to  high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent. The priorities don't need to be  con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You  can  specify the following transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -  Decode  a  Base64
                                      -encoded string,  but  use  a  forgiving
                                      implementation  that  ignores characters
                                      that aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness of attackers who inject an  operat-
                                      ing  system command-line command and use
                                      unusual formatting to disguise  some  or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete  spaces before the following char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace the following characters  with  a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -  Replace   these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                   o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces  mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules  syn-
                                      data.html#characters   .  This  function
                                      uses up to two  bytes  in  the  decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters that were encoded  using  CSS
                                      encoding   that   wouldnt  typically  be
                                      encoded. It's also useful in  countering
                                      evasion,  which  is  a  combination of a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters.   For   example,  ja\vascript  for
                                      javascript.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,
                                      \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,
                                      \xHH   (hexadecimal),   \0OOO   (octal).
                                      Encodings that aren't  valid  remain  in
                                      the output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE       -       Replace
                                      HTML-encoded  characters  with unencoded
                                      characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs
                                      these operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a   "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE  -  Decode  JavaScript  escape
                                      sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is  in
                                      the   full-width  ASCII  code  range  of
                                      FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte is used
                                      to  detect and adjust the lower byte. If
                                      not, only the lower byte is used and the
                                      higher  byte is zeroed, causing a possi-
                                      ble loss of information.

                                      LOWERCASE -  Convert  uppercase  letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5  -  Calculate  an  MD5 hash from the
                                      data in the input. The computed hash  is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE  -  Specify  NONE if you don't want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   -    Remove    multiple
                                      slashes,  directory self-references, and
                                      directory back-references that  are  not
                                      at  the  beginning  of the input from an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   ,  but  first  converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive  occurrences  are  not  compressed.
                                      Unterminated comments are also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE  ,  but
                                      with  support  for Microsoft-specific %u
                                      encoding.  If  the  code   is   in   the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                      adjust  the  lower byte. Otherwise, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all  UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps  input normalization, and minimiz-
                                      ing false-positives and  false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                     GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement used to identify web requests based
                        on country of origin.

                        CountryCodes -> (list)
                            An array of two-character country codes, for exam-
                            ple, [ "US", "CN" ] , from the alpha-2 country ISO
                            codes of the ISO 3166 international standard.

                            (string)

                        ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                            The configuration for inspecting IP  addresses  in
                            an  HTTP header that you specify, instead of using
                            the IP address that's reported by the web  request
                            origin.  Commonly,  this  is  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                            HeaderName -> (string)
                               The  name  of the HTTP header to use for the IP
                               address.  For  example,  to  use   the   X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  set  this to X-For-
                               warded-For .

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The match status to assign to the  web  request
                               if  the request doesn't have a valid IP address
                               in the specified position.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement  used  to  run  the  rules  that  are
                        defined  in  a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule
                        group with your rules, then provide  the  ARN  of  the
                        rule group in this statement.

                        You  cannot  nest  a RuleGroupReferenceStatement , for
                        example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        You  can  only use a rule group reference statement at
                        the top level inside a web ACL.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group  whose
                            actions  are  set  to  Count  . When you exclude a
                            rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                            rule  action setting were Count . This is a useful
                            option for testing the rules in a rule group with-
                            out modifying how they handle your web traffic.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies  a  single rule in a rule group whose
                               action you want to override to Count . When you
                               exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                               would if the rule action setting were  Count  .
                               This  is  a useful option for testing the rules
                               in a rule group without modifying how they han-
                               dle your web traffic.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                     IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to detect  web  requests  coming
                        from particular IP addresses or address ranges. To use
                        this, create an  IPSet that  specifies  the  addresses
                        you  want  to  detect, then use the ARN of that set in
                        this statement. To create an IP set, see   CreateIPSet
                        .

                        Each  IP  set rule statement references an IP set. You
                        create and maintain the set independent of your rules.
                        This  allows  you  to  use  the single set in multiple
                        rules. When you update the referenced set,  WAF  auto-
                        matically updates all rules that reference it.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that
                            this statement references.

                        IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                            The configuration for inspecting IP  addresses  in
                            an  HTTP header that you specify, instead of using
                            the IP address that's reported by the web  request
                            origin.  Commonly,  this  is  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                            HeaderName -> (string)
                               The  name  of the HTTP header to use for the IP
                               address.  For  example,  to  use   the   X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  set  this to X-For-
                               warded-For .

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The match status to assign to the  web  request
                               if  the request doesn't have a valid IP address
                               in the specified position.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                            Position -> (string)
                               The position in the header to search for the IP
                               address. The header can contain IP addresses of
                               the original client and also  of  proxies.  For
                               example,  the  header  value could be 10.1.1.1,
                               127.0.0.0,  10.10.10.10  where  the  first   IP
                               address  identifies the original client and the
                               rest identify proxies  that  the  request  went
                               through.

                               The options for this setting are the following:

                               o FIRST - Inspect the first IP address  in  the
                                 list  of  IP addresses in the header. This is
                                 usually the client's original IP.

                               o LAST - Inspect the last  IP  address  in  the
                                 list of IP addresses in the header.

                               o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the header
                                 for a match. If the header contains more than
                                 10 IP addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

                     RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to search web request components
                        for matches with regular  expressions.  To  use  this,
                        create  a   RegexPatternSet that specifies the expres-
                        sions that you want to detect, then  use  the  ARN  of
                        that  set in this statement. A web request matches the
                        pattern set rule statement if  the  request  component
                        matches  any  of  the patterns in the set. To create a
                        regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                        Each regex pattern set  rule  statement  references  a
                        regex  pattern  set.  You  create and maintain the set
                        independent of your rules. This allows you to use  the
                        single set in multiple rules. When you update the ref-
                        erenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules  that
                        reference it.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPat-
                            ternSet that this statement references.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that  you  want  WAF  to
                            inspect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to  inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of a web request that  identifies  a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body  as  plain  text.  The
                               request  body  immediately  follows the request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF  for
                               inspection  by  the underlying host service. If
                               you don't need to inspect more than 8  KB,  you
                               can  guarantee  that you don't allow additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the  body  of  the web request, such as  ByteM-
                               atchStatement  or    RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of  the
                               request.  WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting the
                               entire contents of web  requests  whose  bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF for
                               inspection by the underlying host  service.  If
                               you  don't  need to inspect more than 8 KB, you
                               can guarantee that you don't  allow  additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the body of the web request,  such  as   ByteM-
                               atchStatement   or   RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces  an 8 KB size limit on the body of the
                               request. WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                               entire  contents  of  web requests whose bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of  the  JSON  to  match  against
                                   using the MatchPattern . If you specify All
                                   , WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection. If you specify  one
                            or  more  transformations in a rule statement, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request  component  identified  by  FieldToMatch ,
                            starting from the lowest priority setting,  before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations  eliminate  some  of  the
                               unusual formatting that attackers  use  in  web
                               requests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations that are defined  for
                                   a  rule statement. WAF processes all trans-
                                   formations, from lowest priority  to  high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent. The priorities don't need to be  con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You  can  specify the following transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -  Decode  a  Base64
                                      -encoded string,  but  use  a  forgiving
                                      implementation  that  ignores characters
                                      that aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness of attackers who inject an  operat-
                                      ing  system command-line command and use
                                      unusual formatting to disguise  some  or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete  spaces before the following char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace the following characters  with  a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -  Replace   these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                   o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces  mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules  syn-
                                      data.html#characters   .  This  function
                                      uses up to two  bytes  in  the  decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters that were encoded  using  CSS
                                      encoding   that   wouldnt  typically  be
                                      encoded. It's also useful in  countering
                                      evasion,  which  is  a  combination of a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters.   For   example,  ja\vascript  for
                                      javascript.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,
                                      \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,
                                      \xHH   (hexadecimal),   \0OOO   (octal).
                                      Encodings that aren't  valid  remain  in
                                      the output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE       -       Replace
                                      HTML-encoded  characters  with unencoded
                                      characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs
                                      these operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a   "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE  -  Decode  JavaScript  escape
                                      sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is  in
                                      the   full-width  ASCII  code  range  of
                                      FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte is used
                                      to  detect and adjust the lower byte. If
                                      not, only the lower byte is used and the
                                      higher  byte is zeroed, causing a possi-
                                      ble loss of information.

                                      LOWERCASE -  Convert  uppercase  letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5  -  Calculate  an  MD5 hash from the
                                      data in the input. The computed hash  is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE  -  Specify  NONE if you don't want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   -    Remove    multiple
                                      slashes,  directory self-references, and
                                      directory back-references that  are  not
                                      at  the  beginning  of the input from an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   ,  but  first  converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive  occurrences  are  not  compressed.
                                      Unterminated comments are also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE  ,  but
                                      with  support  for Microsoft-specific %u
                                      encoding.  If  the  code   is   in   the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                      adjust  the  lower byte. Otherwise, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all  UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps  input normalization, and minimiz-
                                      ing false-positives and  false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                     RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                        A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each
                        originating IP address, and triggers the  rule  action
                        when  the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the
                        number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You  can
                        use  this to put a temporary block on requests from an
                        IP address that is sending excessive requests.

                        WAF tracks and manages  web  requests  separately  for
                        each  instance  of a rate-based rule that you use. For
                        example, if you provide the same rate-based rule  set-
                        tings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements
                        represents a separate instance of the rate-based  rule
                        and  gets  its  own tracking and management by WAF. If
                        you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group,  and
                        then  use that rule group in multiple places, each use
                        creates a separate instance  of  the  rate-based  rule
                        that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

                        When  the  rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional
                        requests from the IP address until  the  request  rate
                        falls below the limit.

                        You  can  optionally nest another statement inside the
                        rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the  rule
                        so  that it only counts requests that match the nested
                        statement. For example, based on recent requests  that
                        you  have  seen  from  an attacker, you might create a
                        rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement  that
                        contains the following nested statements:

                        o An  IP match statement with an IP set that specified
                          the address 192.0.2.44.

                        o A  string  match  statement  that  searches  in  the
                          User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                        In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit.
                        For this example, the rate limit  is  1,000.  Requests
                        that meet both of the conditions in the statements are
                        counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per  five
                        minutes,  the  rule  action triggers. Requests that do
                        not meet both conditions are not counted  towards  the
                        rate limit and are not affected by this rule.

                        You  cannot  nest  a RateBasedStatement inside another
                        statement,  for  example  inside  a  NotStatement   or
                        OrStatement  .  You  can  define  a RateBasedStatement
                        inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                        Limit -> (long)
                            The limit on requests per 5-minute  period  for  a
                            single  originating  IP  address. If the statement
                            includes a  ScopeDownStatement  ,  this  limit  is
                            applied only to the requests that match the state-
                            ment.

                        AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                            Setting  that  indicates  how  to  aggregate   the
                            request counts. The options are the following:

                            o IP  -  Aggregate  the  request  counts on the IP
                              address from the web request origin.

                            o FORWARDED_IP - Aggregate the request  counts  on
                              the  first  IP address in an HTTP header. If you
                              use this, configure the ForwardedIPConfig  ,  to
                              specify the header to use.

                        ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                            An  optional  nested  statement  that  narrows the
                            scope of the web requests that  are  evaluated  by
                            the   rate-based   statement.  Requests  are  only
                            tracked by the rate-based statement if they  match
                            the scope-down statement. You can use any nestable
                            Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can
                            nest  statements at any level, the same as you can
                            for a rule statement.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  for  WAF  to apply to web requests. The
                               byte match  statement  provides  the  bytes  to
                               search  for,  the location in requests that you
                               want WAF to search,  and  other  settings.  The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds with ASCII characters. In  the  WAF
                               console  and  the developer guide, this is ref-
                               ered to as a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A string value that you want WAF to  search
                                   for.  WAF  searches only in the part of web
                                   requests that you designate for  inspection
                                   in   FieldToMatch  .  The maximum length of
                                   the value is 50 bytes.

                                   Valid values depend on the  component  that
                                   you  specify for inspection in FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method : The HTTP method  that  you  want
                                     WAF  to  search  for.  This indicates the
                                     type  of  operation  specified   in   the
                                     request.

                                   o UriPath  : The value that you want WAF to
                                     search for in the URI path, for  example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters A-Z and a-z, note that  the  value  is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify  a  base64-encoded  version  of the
                                   value. The  maximum  length  of  the  value
                                   before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                   For  example,  suppose the value of Type is
                                   HEADER and the value of Data is  User-Agent
                                   .  If  you  want  to  search the User-Agent
                                   header  for  the   value   BadBot   ,   you
                                   base64-encode     BadBot     using     MIME
                                   base64-encoding and include  the  resulting
                                   value,  QmFkQm90  , in the value of Search-
                                   String .
                                      If you're using the CLI or  one  of  the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The  value that you want WAF to search for.
                                   The SDK automatically  base64  encodes  the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-

                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to
                                                 include all  paths.  Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64

                                   The specified part of the web request  must
                                   include  the  value  of  SearchString , and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric
                                   characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
                                   _). In addition,  SearchString  must  be  a
                                   word,  which means that both of the follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString is at the beginning  of  the
                                     specified  part  of the web request or is
                                     preceded by a  character  other  than  an
                                     alphanumeric character or underscore (_).
                                     Examples include the value  of  a  header
                                     and ;BadBot .

                                   o SearchString  is at the end of the speci-
                                     fied part of the web request or  is  fol-
                                     lowed   by  a  character  other  than  an
                                     alphanumeric character or underscore (_),
                                     for example, BadBot; and -BadBot; .
                                      EXACTLY

                                   The  value of the specified part of the web
                                   request must exactly  match  the  value  of

                                   web request.
                                      ENDS_WITH

                                   The  value  of  SearchString must appear at
                                   the end of the specified part  of  the  web
                                   request.

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               Attackers  sometimes  insert malicious SQL code
                               into web requests in an effort to extract  data
                               from  your  database.  To  allow  or  block web
                               requests that appear to contain  malicious  SQL
                               code,  create  one  or more SQL injection match
                               conditions. An SQL  injection  match  condition
                               identifies  the  part  of web requests, such as
                               the URI or the query string, that you want  WAF
                               to inspect. Later in the process, when you cre-
                               ate a web ACL, you specify whether to allow  or
                               block requests that appear to contain malicious
                               SQL code.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional

                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-

                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include

                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations.  These  are  helpful  in
                                             reducing effectiveness of attack-

                                          o Delete the following characters: \

                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                          o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE         also
                                             replaces multiple spaces with one

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that  were  encoded using CSS 2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             LOWERCASE   -  Convert  uppercase
                                             letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                             MD5  - Calculate an MD5 hash from
                                             the data in the input.  The  com-
                                             puted  hash  is  in  a raw binary

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a

                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             If the code is in the  full-width
                                             ASCII  code  range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule  statement  that  defines  a  cross-site
                               scripting  (XSS)  match search for WAF to apply
                               to web requests. XSS attacks  are  those  where
                               the  attacker  uses vulnerabilities in a benign
                               website  as  a  vehicle  to  inject   malicious
                               client-site  scripts  into other legitimate web
                               browsers. The XSS match statement provides  the
                               location  in  requests  that  you  want  WAF to
                               search and text transformations to use  on  the
                               search  area  before WAF searches for character
                               sequences  that  are  likely  to  be  malicious
                               strings.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to
                                                 include all  paths.  Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of
                                             hexadecimal  characters  into   a
                                             binary.

                                             HTML-encoded   characters    with
                                             unencoded             characters.
                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                             escape sequences. If a \  u  HHHH
                                             code  is  in the full-width ASCII
                                             code range of  FF01-FF5E  ,  then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             LOWERCASE  -  Convert   uppercase

                                             the  data  in the input. The com-
                                             puted hash is  in  a  raw  binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE  - Specify NONE if you don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH - Remove  multiple
                                             slashes,   directory  self-refer-
                                             ences, and directory  back-refer-

                                             ning of the input from  an  input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is the
                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS  -  Replace each
                                             occurrence of a  C-style  comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple consecutive  occurrences
                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS   -   Replace  NULL
                                             bytes in  the  input  with  space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode SQL hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE
                                             ,    but    with    support   for
                                             Microsoft-specific  %u  encoding.
                                             If  the code is in the full-width
                                             ASCII code range of  FF01-FF5E  ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert   all
                                             UTF-8 character sequences to Uni-
                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion,  and minimizing false-posi-
                                             tives  and  false-negatives   for
                                             non-English languages.

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  compares  a number of
                               bytes against the size of a request  component,
                               using  a  comparison  operator, such as greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use  a  size  constraint  statement to look for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If you configure WAF  to  inspect  the  request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB). If the request body for your web  requests
                               never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size
                               constraint condition and  block  requests  that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If  you choose URI for the value of Part of the
                               request to filter on, the slash (/) in the  URI
                               counts  as  one character. For example, the URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional

                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The  operator to use to compare the request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte,  to  compare  to  the
                                   request part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule   statement.   WAF
                                        applies   the   rule   action  to  the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule  group  with  your rules, then provide the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You can only  use  a  rule  group
                               reference  statement  at the top level inside a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   entity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The  rules  in  the  referenced  rule group
                                   whose actions are set to Count .  When  you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it would if the rule  action  setting  were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single rule in a rule group
                                      whose action you  want  to  override  to
                                      Count  .  When  you  exclude a rule, WAF
                                      evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a  rule group without modifying how they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  rule  whose  action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used to detect web requests
                               coming from particular IP addresses or  address
                               ranges.  To  use  this,  create  an  IPSet that
                               specifies the addresses  you  want  to  detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each IP set rule  statement  references  an  IP
                               set.  You  create and maintain the set indepen-
                               dent of your rules. This allows you to use  the
                               single  set  in multiple rules. When you update
                               the referenced set, WAF  automatically  updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses  in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported  by  the  web request origin. Com-
                                   monly, this is  the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)
                                   header,  but  you  can  specify  any header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule   statement.   WAF
                                        applies   the   rule   action  to  the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the IP address. The header  can  contain
                                      IP  addresses of the original client and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value   could  be  10.1.1.1,  127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10 where the first  IP  address
                                      identifies  the  original client and the
                                      rest identify proxies that  the  request
                                      went through.

                                      The  options  for  this  setting are the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST - Inspect the first  IP  address
                                        in  the  list  of  IP addresses in the
                                        header. This is usually  the  client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST  - Inspect the last IP address in
                                        the  list  of  IP  addresses  in   the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains  more  than 10 IP addresses, WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components  for  matches  with  regular expres-
                               sions. To use this, create  a   RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect, then use the ARN of that  set  in  this
                               statement.  A  web  request matches the pattern
                               set rule statement  if  the  request  component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate a regex pattern set,  see   CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain  the  set  independent of your rules. This
                               allows you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                               rules.  When you update the referenced set, WAF
                               automatically updates all rules that  reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as

                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to
                                                 include all  paths.  Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rate-based  rule tracks the rate of requests
                               for each originating IP address,  and  triggers
                               the  rule  action when the rate exceeds a limit
                               that you specify on the number of  requests  in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a  temporary  block  on  requests  from  an  IP
                               address that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF  tracks and manages web requests separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use.  For  example,  if  you  provide  the same
                               rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs,  each
                               of  the  two rule statements represents a sepa-
                               rate instance of the rate-based rule  and  gets
                               its  own tracking and management by WAF. If you
                               define a rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the  rate-based rule that gets its own tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional  requests  from the IP address until the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You  can  optionally  nest  another   statement
                               inside  the rate-based statement, to narrow the
                               scope of  the  rule  so  that  it  only  counts
                               requests  that  match the nested statement. For
                               example, based on recent requests that you have
                               seen  from  an  attacker,  you  might  create a
                               rate-based rule with a nested AND  rule  state-
                               ment  that contains the following nested state-
                               ments:

                               o An IP match statement with  an  IP  set  that
                                 specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit.  For  this  example,  the  rate limit is
                               1,000. Requests that meet both  of  the  condi-
                               tions  in  the  statements  are counted. If the
                               count exceeds 1,000 requests per five  minutes,
                               the  rule action triggers. Requests that do not
                               meet both conditions are  not  counted  towards
                               the  rate  limit  and  are not affected by this
                               rule.

                               You cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement  inside
                               another  statement,  for  example inside a Not-
                               Statement or OrStatement .  You  can  define  a
                               RateBasedStatement  inside a web ACL and inside
                               a rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The limit on requests per  5-minute  period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement includes a  ScopeDownStatement  ,
                                   this  limit is applied only to the requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP   -  Aggregate  the  request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header.  If  you  use this, configure the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               (   ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig  ->
                               (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses  in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported  by  the  web request origin. Com-
                                   monly, this is  the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)
                                   header,  but  you  can  specify  any header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching   the   rule  statement.  WAF
                                        applies  the  rule   action   to   the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to combine  other
                               rule  statements  with  AND  logic. You provide
                               more than one  Statement within  the  AndState-
                               ment .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to combine with AND logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            OrStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with OR logic. You provide more
                               than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to  combine with OR logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            NotStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical  rule  statement  used to negate the
                               results of another rule statement. You  provide
                               one  Statement within the NotStatement .

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a managed rule group. To  use  this,
                               provide  the  vendor  name  and the name of the
                               rule group in this statement. You can  retrieve
                               the  required names by calling  ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You cannot nest a  ManagedRuleGroupStatement  ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . It can only be  referenced  as  a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the managed rule group vendor.
                                   You use this, along  with  the  rule  group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this, along with the vendor name, to  iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The  version  of  the managed rule group to
                                   use. If you specify this, the version  set-
                                   ting  is  fixed until you change it. If you
                                   don't specify this, WAF uses  the  vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's  default  when  the  vendor
                                   updates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The  rules  in  the  referenced  rule group
                                   whose actions are set to Count .  When  you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it would if the rule  action  setting  were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single rule in a rule group
                                      whose action you  want  to  override  to
                                      Count  .  When  you  exclude a rule, WAF
                                      evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a  rule group without modifying how they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  rule  whose  action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search against labels that have been  added  to
                               the  web request by rules that have already run
                               in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix,  optional  namespaces, and label name. The
                               prefix identifies the rule  group  or  web  ACL
                               context  of  the  rule that added the label. If
                               you do not provide the fully qualified name  in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search for labels that were added in  the  same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The string to match  against.  The  setting
                                   you  provide  for this depends on the match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then  this
                                     specification  must  include the name and
                                     can  include  any  number  of   preceding
                                     namespace specifications and prefix up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If  the  Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of  contiguous namespace strings, and can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from  the rule group or web ACL where the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a  label  must  be  separated by colon, for
                                   example NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional

                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-

                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to
                                                 include all  paths.  Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations.  These  are  helpful  in
                                             reducing effectiveness of attack-

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following

                                          o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE         also
                                             replaces multiple spaces with one

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that were encoded using  CSS  2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can   help   to
                                             uncover   ASCII  characters  that
                                             were encoded using  CSS  encoding
                                             that    wouldnt    typically   be
                                             encoded.  It's  also  useful   in
                                             countering  evasion,  which  is a
                                             combination of  a  backslash  and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,     ja\vascript      for

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of
                                             hexadecimal  characters  into   a
                                             binary.

                                             unencoded             characters.
                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                          o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                          o Replaces  (ampersand)nbsp;  with a

                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE
                                             ,    but    with    support   for
                                             Microsoft-specific  %u  encoding.
                                             If  the code is in the full-width
                                             ASCII code range of  FF01-FF5E  ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert   all

                        ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                            The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses in
                            an HTTP header that you specify, instead of  using
                            the  IP address that's reported by the web request
                            origin.  Commonly,  this  is  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                            This is required if  AggregateKeyType  is  set  to
                            FORWARDED_IP .

                            HeaderName -> (string)
                               The  name  of the HTTP header to use for the IP
                               address.  For  example,  to  use   the   X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  set  this to X-For-
                               warded-For .

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The match status to assign to the  web  request
                               if  the request doesn't have a valid IP address
                               in the specified position.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     AndStatement -> (structure)
                        A logical rule statement used to  combine  other  rule
                        statements  with  AND logic. You provide more than one
                        Statement within the AndStatement .

                        Statements -> (list)
                            The statements to combine with AND logic. You  can
                            use any statements that can be nested.

                            (structure)
                               The  processing  guidance for a  Rule , used by
                               WAF to determine whether a web request  matches
                               the rule.

                               ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule  statement  that  defines  a string
                                   match  search  for  WAF  to  apply  to  web
                                   requests. The byte match statement provides
                                   the bytes to search for,  the  location  in
                                   requests  that  you want WAF to search, and
                                   other settings. The bytes to search for are
                                   typically  a  string  that corresponds with
                                   ASCII characters. In the  WAF  console  and
                                   the  developer guide, this is refered to as
                                   a string match statement.

                                   SearchString -> (blob)
                                      A string value  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                      search  for.  WAF  searches  only in the
                                      part of web requests that you  designate
                                      for  inspection  in   FieldToMatch . The
                                      maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.

                                      Valid  values  depend  on  the component
                                      that  you  specify  for  inspection   in
                                      FieldToMatch :

                                      o Method : The HTTP method that you want
                                        WAF to search for. This indicates  the
                                        type  of  operation  specified  in the
                                        request.

                                      o UriPath : The value that you want  WAF
                                        to  search  for  in  the URI path, for
                                        example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      If  SearchString   includes   alphabetic
                                      characters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the
                                      value is case sensitive.
                                          If you're using the WAF API

                                      Specify a base64-encoded version of  the
                                      value.  The  maximum length of the value
                                      before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                      For  example,  suppose the value of Type
                                      is HEADER  and  the  value  of  Data  is
                                      User-Agent  .  If you want to search the
                                      User-Agent header for the value BadBot ,
                                      you   base64-encode  BadBot  using  MIME
                                      base64-encoding and include the  result-
                                      ing  value,  QmFkQm90  , in the value of
                                      SearchString .
                                          If you're using the CLI  or  one  of
                                          the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                      The  value  that  you want WAF to search
                                      for.  The   SDK   automatically   base64
                                      encodes the value.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request  component  for  WAF  to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The patterns to look for  in  the
                                             JSON   body.   WAF  inspects  the
                                             results of these pattern  matches
                                             against  the rule inspection cri-
                                             teria.

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or the IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match  only   the   specified
                                                 include   paths.   See   also

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  All  setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't  use  this option to
                                                    include     all     paths.

                                                 (string)

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The parts of the  JSON  to  match
                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body  as  plain  text.  WAF

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be

                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content

                                                 and adjust the lower byte. If
                                                 not, only the lower  byte  is
                                                 used  and  the higher byte is
                                                 zeroed,  causing  a  possible
                                                 loss of information.

                                                 and adjust  the  lower  byte.
                                                 Otherwise,   only  the  lower
                                                 byte is used and  the  higher
                                                 byte is zeroed.

                                          CONTAINS

                                      The specified part of  the  web  request
                                      must include the value of SearchString ,
                                      but the location doesn't matter.

                                      (A-Z, a-z,  0-9,  or  _).  In  addition,
                                      SearchString must be a word, which means
                                      that both of the following are true:

                                      o SearchString is at  the  beginning  of
                                        the  specified part of the web request

                                        than   an  alphanumeric  character  or
                                        underscore (_). Examples  include  the
                                        value of a header and ;BadBot .

                                      o SearchString  is  at  the  end  of the

                               SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   Attackers sometimes  insert  malicious  SQL
                                   code  into  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                   extract data from your database.  To  allow

                                   tain malicious SQL code, create one or more
                                   SQL  injection  match  conditions.  An  SQL
                                   injection match  condition  identifies  the
                                   part  of  web  requests, such as the URI or
                                   the query string,  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                   inspect.  Later  in  the  process, when you
                                   create a web ACL, you  specify  whether  to
                                   allow or block requests that appear to con-
                                   tain malicious SQL code.

                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The  patterns  to look for in the
                                             JSON  body.  WAF   inspects   the
                                             results  of these pattern matches
                                             against the rule inspection  cri-
                                             teria.

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match  all  of  the elements.

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match   only   the  specified
                                                 include   paths.   See   also

                                                 using  JSON  Pointer  syntax.
                                                 For example, "IncludedPaths":

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or  the All setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't use this  option  to
                                                    include     all     paths.
                                                    Instead, use the All  set-

                                                 (string)

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The  parts  of  the JSON to match
                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the  body  as  plain  text. WAF
                                               applies  the  text  transforma-
                                               tions  and  inspection criteria
                                               that you defined for  the  JSON
                                               inspection  to  the  body  text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of

                               XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement that defines a  cross-site
                                   scripting  (XSS)  match  search  for WAF to
                                   apply to  web  requests.  XSS  attacks  are
                                   those  where the attacker uses vulnerabili-
                                   ties in a benign website as  a  vehicle  to

                                   other  legitimate  web  browsers.  The  XSS
                                   match  statement  provides  the location in
                                   requests that you want WAF  to  search  and
                                   text  transformations  to use on the search
                                   area  before  WAF  searches  for  character
                                   sequences  that  are likely to be malicious
                                   strings.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web  request  component  for  WAF to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as

                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the

                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't use this  option  to

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The  parts  of  the JSON to match
                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the  body  as  plain  text. WAF
                                               applies  the  text  transforma-
                                               tions  and  inspection criteria
                                               that you defined for  the  JSON
                                               inspection  to  the  body  text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection. If you specify one  or
                                      more  transformations  in  a rule state-
                                      ment, WAF performs  all  transformations
                                      on  the content of the request component
                                      identified by  FieldToMatch  ,  starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets   the   relative  processing
                                             order  for  multiple  transforma-

                                             statement.  WAF   processes   all
                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing  the transformed content. The
                                             priorities don't need to be  con-
                                             secutive,  but  they  must all be
                                             different.

                                          Type -> (string)
                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             transformation types:
                                                 BASE64_DECODE   -   Decode  a

                                                 BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode  a

                                                 use a  forgiving  implementa-

                                                 transformations.   These  are
                                                 helpful  in  reducing  effec-

                               SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement that compares a number  of
                                   bytes  against the size of a request compo-
                                   nent, using a comparison operator, such  as
                                   greater  than  (>)  or  less  than (<). For
                                   example, you  can  use  a  size  constraint
                                   statement  to  look  for query strings that
                                   are longer than 100 bytes.

                                   If you configure WAF to inspect the request
                                   body,  WAF  inspects  only  the  first 8192
                                   bytes (8 KB). If the request body for  your
                                   web  requests never exceeds 8192 bytes, you
                                   can create a size constraint condition  and
                                   block  requests  that  have  a request body
                                   greater than 8192 bytes.

                                   If you choose URI for the value of Part  of

                                   the URI counts as one character. For  exam-
                                   ple,  the  URI /logo.jpg is nine characters

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web  request  component  for  WAF to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The  patterns  to look for in the
                                             JSON  body.  WAF   inspects   the
                                             results  of these pattern matches
                                             against the rule inspection  cri-

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match  all  of  the elements.

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match   only   the  specified

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or  the All setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't use this  option  to

                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-

                                      The size, in byte,  to  compare  to  the
                                      request part, after any transformations.

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass  detection. If you specify one or
                                      more transformations in  a  rule  state-
                                      ment,  WAF  performs all transformations
                                      on the content of the request  component
                                      identified  by  FieldToMatch  , starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an

                                             secutive, but they  must  all  be
                                             different.

                                                 helpful  in  reducing  effec-

                                                 it  can help to uncover ASCII
                                                 characters that were  encoded

                                                 not, only the lower  byte  is
                                                 used  and  the higher byte is
                                                 zeroed,  causing  a  possible

                                                 higher byte is used to detect
                                                 and adjust  the  lower  byte.
                                                 Otherwise,   only  the  lower
                                                 byte is used and  the  higher
                                                 byte is zeroed.

                                   ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The   configuration  for  inspecting  IP
                                      addresses in an  HTTP  header  that  you
                                      specify, instead of using the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,
                                   create  a  rule group with your rules, then
                                   provide the ARN of the rule group  in  this
                                   statement.

                                   You  cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceState-
                                   ment , for example for use  inside  a  Not-
                                   Statement or OrStatement . You can only use
                                   a rule group reference statement at the top
                                   level inside a web ACL.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      entity.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      The rules in the referenced  rule  group
                                      whose  actions  are  set to Count . When
                                      you exclude a  rule,  WAF  evaluates  it
                                      exactly  as  it would if the rule action
                                      setting were Count . This  is  a  useful
                                      option  for  testing the rules in a rule
                                      group without modifying how they  handle
                                      your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies  a  single  rule in a rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride  to  Count . When you exclude a
                                          rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                                          would  if  the  rule  action setting
                                          were Count . This is a useful option
                                          for  testing  the  rules  in  a rule
                                          group  without  modifying  how  they
                                          handle your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                               IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule  statement  used  to   detect   web
                                   requests    coming   from   particular   IP
                                   addresses or address ranges. To  use  this,
                                   create   an    IPSet   that  specifies  the
                                   addresses you want to detect, then use  the
                                   ARN  of that set in this statement. To cre-
                                   ate an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                                   Each IP set rule statement references an IP
                                   set.  You create and maintain the set inde-
                                   pendent of your rules. This allows  you  to
                                   use  the single set in multiple rules. When
                                   you update the referenced set, WAF automat-
                                   ically updates all rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      IPSet that this statement references.

                                   IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The   configuration  for  inspecting  IP
                                      addresses in an  HTTP  header  that  you
                                      specify, instead of using the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                      Position -> (string)
                                          The position in the header to search
                                          for the IP address. The  header  can
                                          contain IP addresses of the original
                                          client  and  also  of  proxies.  For
                                          example,  the  header value could be
                                          10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,   10.10.10.10
                                          where  the  first IP address identi-
                                          fies the  original  client  and  the
                                          rest   identify   proxies  that  the
                                          request went through.

                                          The options for this setting are the
                                          following:

                                          o FIRST   -  Inspect  the  first  IP
                                            address  in   the   list   of   IP
                                            addresses  in  the header. This is
                                            usually the client's original  IP.

                                          o LAST - Inspect the last IP address
                                            in the list of IP addresses in the
                                            header.

                                          o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in
                                            the header for  a  match.  If  the
                                            header  contains  more  than 10 IP
                                            addresses, WAF inspects  the  last
                                            10.

                               RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement   ->  (struc-
                               ture)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for matches with regular expres-
                                   sions. To use  this,  create  a   RegexPat-
                                   ternSet that specifies the expressions that
                                   you want to detect, then  use  the  ARN  of
                                   that  set  in this statement. A web request
                                   matches the pattern set rule  statement  if
                                   the  request  component  matches any of the
                                   patterns in the set. To create a regex pat-
                                   tern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                   Each  regex pattern set rule statement ref-
                                   erences a regex pattern set. You create and
                                   maintain the set independent of your rules.
                                   This allows you to use the  single  set  in
                                   multiple  rules. When you update the refer-
                                   enced set, WAF  automatically  updates  all
                                   rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      RegexPatternSet that this statement ref-
                                      erences.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want
                                      WAF to inspect.  For  more  information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request  component  for  WAF  to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The patterns to look for  in  the
                                             JSON   body.   WAF  inspects  the

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or the IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match  only   the   specified
                                                 include   paths.   See   also

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  All  setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't  use  this option to
                                                    include     all     paths.
                                                    Instead,  use the All set-

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The parts of the  JSON  to  match
                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body  as  plain  text.  WAF
                                               applies  the  text  transforma-
                                               tions and  inspection  criteria
                                               that  you  defined for the JSON
                                               inspection  to  the  body  text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass  detection. If you specify one or
                                      more transformations in  a  rule  state-
                                      ment,  WAF  performs all transformations
                                      on the content of the request  component
                                      identified  by  FieldToMatch  , starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before

                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets  the   relative   processing

                                                 function uses up to two bytes
                                                 in the decoding  process,  so
                                                 it  can help to uncover ASCII
                                                 characters that were  encoded
                                                 using   CSS   encoding   that
                                                 wouldnt typically be encoded.
                                                 It's  also useful in counter-

                               RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                   A   rate-based  rule  tracks  the  rate  of
                                   requests for each originating  IP  address,
                                   and  triggers the rule action when the rate
                                   exceeds a limit that  you  specify  on  the
                                   number  of  requests  in  any 5-minute time
                                   span. You can use this to put  a  temporary
                                   block  on  requests from an IP address that
                                   is sending excessive requests.

                                   WAF tracks and manages web  requests  sepa-
                                   rately  for  each  instance of a rate-based
                                   rule that you use. For example, if you pro-
                                   vide  the  same rate-based rule settings in
                                   two web ACLs, each of the two  rule  state-
                                   ments represents a separate instance of the
                                   rate-based rule and gets its  own  tracking
                                   and  management  by  WAF.  If  you define a
                                   rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,  and
                                   then   use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                                   places,  each  use   creates   a   separate
                                   instance  of  the rate-based rule that gets
                                   its own tracking and management by WAF.

                                   When the rule action triggers,  WAF  blocks
                                   additional  requests  from  the  IP address
                                   until the  request  rate  falls  below  the
                                   limit.

                                   You  can  optionally nest another statement
                                   inside the rate-based statement, to  narrow
                                   the  scope  of  the  rule  so  that it only
                                   counts  requests  that  match  the   nested
                                   statement.  For  example,  based  on recent
                                   requests  that  you  have  seen   from   an
                                   attacker,  you  might  create  a rate-based
                                   rule with a nested AND rule statement  that
                                   contains the following nested statements:

                                   o An IP match statement with an IP set that
                                     specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                   o A string match statement that searches in
                                     the User-Agent header for the string Bad-
                                     Bot.

                                   In this rate-based rule, you also define  a
                                   rate  limit.  For  this  example,  the rate
                                   limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both  of
                                   the   conditions   in  the  statements  are
                                   counted.  If  the   count   exceeds   1,000
                                   requests  per five minutes, the rule action
                                   triggers. Requests that do  not  meet  both
                                   conditions are not counted towards the rate
                                   limit and are not affected by this rule.

                                   You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside
                                   another  statement,  for  example  inside a
                                   NotStatement  or  OrStatement  .  You   can
                                   define  a  RateBasedStatement  inside a web
                                   ACL and inside a rule group.

                                   Limit -> (long)
                                      The  limit  on  requests  per   5-minute
                                      period   for  a  single  originating  IP
                                      address. If  the  statement  includes  a
                                      ScopeDownStatement   ,   this  limit  is
                                      applied only to the requests that  match
                                      the statement.

                                   AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                      Setting  that indicates how to aggregate
                                      the request counts. The options are  the
                                      following:

                                      o IP  -  Aggregate the request counts on
                                        the IP address from  the  web  request
                                        origin.

                                      o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request
                                        counts on the first IP address  in  an
                                        HTTP  header. If you use this, config-
                                        ure the ForwardedIPConfig , to specify
                                        the header to use.

                                   (  ...  recursive ... )ForwardedIPConfig ->
                                   (structure)
                                      The  configuration  for  inspecting   IP
                                      addresses  in  an  HTTP  header that you
                                      specify, instead of using the IP address
                                      that's  reported by the web request ori-
                                      gin.  Commonly,  this  is   the   X-For-
                                      warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but  you can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      This  is required if AggregateKeyType is
                                      set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               AndStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  logical  rule  statement used to combine
                                   other rule statements with AND  logic.  You

                                   Statements -> (list)
                                      The  statements  to  combine  with   AND
                                      logic.  You  can use any statements that
                                      can be nested.

                               OrStatement -> (structure)
                                   A logical rule statement  used  to  combine
                                   other  rule  statements  with OR logic. You
                                   provide more than one  Statement within the
                                   OrStatement .

                                   Statements -> (list)
                                      The statements to combine with OR logic.
                                      You can use any statements that  can  be
                                      nested.

                               NotStatement -> (structure)
                                   A logical rule statement used to negate the
                                   results of another rule statement. You pro-
                                   vide one  Statement within the NotStatement
                                   .

                               ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are defined in a managed rule group. To use
                                   this, provide the vendor name and the  name
                                   of  the  rule  group in this statement. You
                                   can retrieve the required names by  calling
                                   ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                                   You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement
                                   , for example for use inside a NotStatement
                                   or  OrStatement . It can only be referenced
                                   as a top-level statement within a rule.

                                   VendorName -> (string)
                                      The name of the managed rule group  ven-
                                      dor.  You  use this, along with the rule
                                      group name, to identify the rule  group.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name of the managed rule group. You
                                      use this, along with the vendor name, to
                                      identify the rule group.

                                   Version -> (string)
                                      The version of the managed rule group to
                                      use. If you specify  this,  the  version
                                      setting is fixed until you change it. If
                                      you don't specify  this,  WAF  uses  the
                                      vendor's default version, and then keeps
                                      the version at the vendor's default when
                                      the  vendor  updates  the  managed  rule
                                      group settings.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      The rules in the referenced  rule  group
                                      whose  actions  are  set to Count . When
                                      you exclude a  rule,  WAF  evaluates  it
                                      exactly  as  it would if the rule action
                                      setting were Count . This  is  a  useful
                                      option  for  testing the rules in a rule
                                      group without modifying how they  handle
                                      your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies  a  single  rule in a rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride  to  Count . When you exclude a
                                          rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                                          would  if  the  rule  action setting
                                          were Count . This is a useful option
                                          for  testing  the  rules  in  a rule
                                          group  without  modifying  how  they
                                          handle your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                               LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule  statement  that  defines  a  string
                                   match  search against labels that have been
                                   added to the web request by rules that have
                                   already run in the web ACL.

                                   The  label  match  statement  provides  the
                                   label or namespace string  to  search  for.
                                   The  label  string  can represent a part or
                                   all of the fully qualified label name  that
                                   had  been  added  to the web request. Fully
                                   qualified labels have  a  prefix,  optional
                                   namespaces,  and  label  name.  The  prefix
                                   identifies the rule group or web  ACL  con-
                                   text  of  the rule that added the label. If
                                   you do not provide the fully qualified name
                                   in  your  label  match string, WAF performs
                                   the search for labels that  were  added  in
                                   the  same context as the label match state-
                                   ment.

                                   Scope -> (string)
                                      Specify whether you want to match  using
                                      the label name or just the namespace.

                                   Key -> (string)
                                      The string to match against. The setting
                                      you provide  for  this  depends  on  the
                                      match statement's Scope setting:

                                      o If  the  Scope  indicates LABEL , then
                                        this specification  must  include  the
                                        name  and  can  include  any number of
                                        preceding namespace specifications and
                                        prefix up to providing the fully qual-
                                        ified label name.

                                      o If the  Scope  indicates  NAMESPACE  ,
                                        then  this  specification  can include
                                        any  number  of  contiguous  namespace
                                        strings,  and  can  include the entire
                                        label namespace prefix from  the  rule
                                        group or web ACL where the label orig-
                                        inates.

                                      Labels are case sensitive and components
                                      of  a  label must be separated by colon,
                                      for example NS1:NS2:name .

                               RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components  for  a  match  against a single
                                   regular expression.

                                   RegexString -> (string)
                                      The  string  representing  the   regular
                                      expression.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want
                                      WAF to inspect.  For  more  information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request  component  for  WAF  to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to

                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't

                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-

                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-

                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The patterns to look for  in  the
                                             JSON   body.   WAF  inspects  the

                                             against  the rule inspection cri-

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or the IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match  only   the   specified
                                                 include   paths.   See   also

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  All  setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't  use  this option to
                                                    include     all     paths.
                                                    Instead,  use the All set-

                                                 (string)

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The parts of the  JSON  to  match
                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body  as  plain  text.  WAF
                                               applies  the  text  transforma-
                                               tions and  inspection  criteria
                                               that  you  defined for the JSON
                                               inspection  to  the  body  text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass  detection. If you specify one or
                                      more transformations in  a  rule  state-
                                      ment,  WAF  performs all transformations
                                      on the content of the request  component
                                      identified  by  FieldToMatch  , starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some

                                          attackers  use in web requests in an

                     OrStatement -> (structure)
                        A  logical  rule  statement used to combine other rule
                        statements with OR logic. You provide  more  than  one
                        Statement within the OrStatement .

                        Statements -> (list)
                            The  statements  to combine with OR logic. You can
                            use any statements that can be nested.

                            (structure)
                               The processing guidance for a  Rule ,  used  by
                               WAF  to determine whether a web request matches
                               the rule.

                               ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule  statement  that  defines  a  string
                                   match  search  for  WAF  to  apply  to  web
                                   requests. The byte match statement provides
                                   the  bytes  to  search for, the location in
                                   requests that you want WAF to  search,  and
                                   other settings. The bytes to search for are
                                   typically a string  that  corresponds  with
                                   ASCII  characters.  In  the WAF console and
                                   the developer guide, this is refered to  as
                                   a string match statement.

                                   SearchString -> (blob)
                                      A  string  value  that  you  want WAF to
                                      search for. WAF  searches  only  in  the
                                      part  of web requests that you designate
                                      for inspection in   FieldToMatch  .  The
                                      maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.

                                      Valid values  depend  on  the  component
                                      that   you  specify  for  inspection  in
                                      FieldToMatch :

                                      o Method : The HTTP method that you want
                                        WAF  to search for. This indicates the
                                        type of  operation  specified  in  the
                                        request.

                                      o UriPath  : The value that you want WAF
                                        to search for in  the  URI  path,  for
                                        example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      If   SearchString   includes  alphabetic
                                      characters A-Z and a-z,  note  that  the
                                      value is case sensitive.
                                          If you're using the WAF API

                                      Specify  a base64-encoded version of the
                                      value. The maximum length of  the  value
                                      before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                      For example, suppose the value  of  Type
                                      is  HEADER  and  the  value  of  Data is
                                      User-Agent . If you want to  search  the
                                      User-Agent header for the value BadBot ,
                                      you  base64-encode  BadBot  using   MIME
                                      base64-encoding  and include the result-
                                      ing value, QmFkQm90 , in  the  value  of
                                      SearchString .
                                          If  you're  using  the CLI or one of
                                          the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                      The value that you want  WAF  to  search
                                      for.   The   SDK   automatically  base64
                                      encodes the value.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web  request  component  for  WAF to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The  patterns  to look for in the
                                             JSON  body.  WAF   inspects   the
                                             results  of these pattern matches
                                             against the rule inspection  cri-

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match  all  of  the elements.

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match   only   the  specified

                                                 For example, "IncludedPaths":

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or  the All setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't use this  option  to
                                                    include     all     paths.
                                                    Instead, use the All  set-

                                                 (string)

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The  parts  of  the JSON to match
                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the  body  as  plain  text. WAF
                                               applies  the  text  transforma-
                                               tions  and  inspection criteria
                                               that you defined for  the  JSON
                                               inspection  to  the  body  text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection. If you specify one  or
                                      more  transformations  in  a rule state-
                                      ment, WAF performs  all  transformations
                                      on  the content of the request component
                                      identified by  FieldToMatch  ,  starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets   the   relative  processing
                                             order  for  multiple  transforma-
                                             tions that are defined for a rule
                                             statement.  WAF   processes   all
                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing  the transformed content. The
                                             priorities don't need to be  con-
                                             secutive,  but  they  must all be
                                             different.

                                          Type -> (string)
                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             transformation types:
                                                 BASE64_DECODE   -   Decode  a
                                                 Base64 -encoded string.

                                                 BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode  a
                                                 Base64  -encoded  string, but
                                                 use a  forgiving  implementa-
                                                 tion  that ignores characters
                                                 that aren't valid.

                                                 transformations.   These  are
                                                 helpful  in  reducing  effec-

                                   PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                                      The area within the  portion  of  a  web
                                      request  that you want WAF to search for
                                      SearchString . Valid values include  the
                                      following:
                                          CONTAINS

                                      The  specified  part  of the web request
                                      must include the value of SearchString ,
                                      but the location doesn't matter.
                                          CONTAINS_WORD

                                      The  specified  part  of the web request
                                      must include the value of SearchString ,
                                      and   SearchString   must  contain  only
                                      alphanumeric  characters  or  underscore
                                      (A-Z,  a-z,  0-9,  or  _).  In addition,
                                      SearchString must be a word, which means
                                      that both of the following are true:

                                      o SearchString  is  at  the beginning of
                                        the specified part of the web  request
                                        or  is  preceded  by a character other
                                        than  an  alphanumeric  character   or
                                        underscore  (_).  Examples include the
                                        value of a header and ;BadBot .

                                      o SearchString is  at  the  end  of  the
                                        specified  part  of the web request or
                                        is followed by a character other  than
                                        an  alphanumeric  character  or under-
                                        score (_), for  example,  BadBot;  and
                                        -BadBot; .
                                          EXACTLY

                                      The  value  of the specified part of the
                                      web request must exactly match the value
                                      of SearchString .
                                          STARTS_WITH

                                      The value of SearchString must appear at
                                      the beginning of the specified  part  of
                                      the web request.
                                          ENDS_WITH

                                      The value of SearchString must appear at
                                      the end of the specified part of the web
                                      request.

                               SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   Attackers  sometimes  insert  malicious SQL
                                   code into web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                   extract  data  from your database. To allow
                                   or block web requests that appear  to  con-
                                   tain malicious SQL code, create one or more
                                   SQL  injection  match  conditions.  An  SQL
                                   injection  match  condition  identifies the
                                   part of web requests, such as  the  URI  or
                                   the  query  string,  that  you  want WAF to
                                   inspect. Later in  the  process,  when  you
                                   create  a  web  ACL, you specify whether to
                                   allow or block requests that appear to con-
                                   tain malicious SQL code.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want
                                      WAF to inspect.  For  more  information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request  component  for  WAF  to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or the IncludedPaths

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match  only   the   specified

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  All  setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't  use  this option to
                                                    include     all     paths.
                                                    Instead,  use the All set-

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The parts of the  JSON  to  match
                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body  as  plain  text.  WAF
                                               applies  the  text  transforma-
                                               tions and  inspection  criteria
                                               that  you  defined for the JSON
                                               inspection  to  the  body  text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass  detection. If you specify one or
                                      more transformations in  a  rule  state-
                                      ment,  WAF  performs all transformations
                                      on the content of the request  component
                                      identified  by  FieldToMatch  , starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets  the   relative   processing
                                             order  for  multiple  transforma-

                                             statement.   WAF   processes  all
                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing the transformed content.  The
                                             priorities  don't need to be con-
                                             secutive, but they  must  all  be
                                             different.

                                          Type -> (string)
                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             transformation types:
                                                 BASE64_DECODE  -   Decode   a
                                                 Base64 -encoded string.

                                                 BASE64_DECODE_EXT  - Decode a

                                                 use  a  forgiving implementa-
                                                 tion that ignores  characters
                                                 that aren't valid.

                                                 helpful  in  reducing  effec-

                                                 data.html#characters  .  This
                                                 function uses up to two bytes
                                                 in the decoding  process,  so
                                                 it  can help to uncover ASCII
                                                 characters that were  encoded
                                                 using   CSS   encoding   that
                                                 wouldnt typically be encoded.
                                                 It's  also useful in counter-

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request  component  for  WAF  to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The patterns to look for  in  the
                                             JSON   body.   WAF  inspects  the
                                             results of these pattern  matches
                                             against  the rule inspection cri-

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or the IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match  only   the   specified

                                                 You  must specify either this

                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't  use  this option to

                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body  as  plain  text.  WAF

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass  detection. If you specify one or

                                                 zeroed,  causing  a  possible
                                                 loss of information.

                                                 LOWERCASE - Convert uppercase

                                                 MD5  -  Calculate an MD5 hash
                                                 from the data in  the  input.
                                                 The computed hash is in a raw
                                                 binary form.

                                                 NONE - Specify  NONE  if  you

                                                 input from an input string.

                                                 NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is
                                                 the same as NORMALIZE_PATH  ,
                                                 but  first converts backslash

                                                 SQL_HEX_DECODE -  Decode  SQL
                                                 hex data. Example (0x414243 )
                                                 will be decoded to (ABC ).

                                                 URL_DECODE   -    Decode    a
                                                 URL-encoded value.

                                                 URL_DECODE_UNI     -     Like
                                                 URL_DECODE , but with support
                                                 for   Microsoft-specific   %u
                                                 encoding. If the code  is  in

                                                 range  of  FF01-FF5E  ,   the
                                                 higher byte is used to detect
                                                 and adjust  the  lower  byte.
                                                 Otherwise,   only  the  lower
                                                 byte is used and  the  higher
                                                 byte is zeroed.

                                                 UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all
                                                 UTF-8 character sequences  to
                                                 Unicode.   This  helps  input
                                                 normalization, and minimizing
                                                 false-positives           and
                                                 false-negatives           for
                                                 non-English languages.

                               SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule statement that compares a number of
                                   bytes against the size of a request  compo-
                                   nent,  using a comparison operator, such as
                                   greater than (>)  or  less  than  (<).  For
                                   example,  you  can  use  a  size constraint
                                   statement to look for  query  strings  that
                                   are longer than 100 bytes.

                                   If you configure WAF to inspect the request
                                   body, WAF  inspects  only  the  first  8192
                                   bytes  (8 KB). If the request body for your
                                   web requests never exceeds 8192 bytes,  you
                                   can  create a size constraint condition and
                                   block requests that  have  a  request  body
                                   greater than 8192 bytes.

                                   If  you choose URI for the value of Part of
                                   the request to filter on, the slash (/)  in
                                   the  URI counts as one character. For exam-
                                   ple, the URI /logo.jpg is  nine  characters
                                   long.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want
                                      WAF to inspect.  For  more  information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request  component  for  WAF  to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces an 8 KB size limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The patterns to look for  in  the
                                             JSON   body.   WAF  inspects  the
                                             results of these pattern  matches
                                             against  the rule inspection cri-
                                             teria.

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or the IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match  only   the   specified
                                                 include   paths.   See   also

                                                 using  JSON  Pointer  syntax.
                                                 For example, "IncludedPaths":
                                                 ["/dogs/0/name",

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  All  setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't  use  this option to
                                                    include     all     paths.
                                                    Instead,  use the All set-

                                                 (string)

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The parts of the  JSON  to  match
                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body  as  plain  text.  WAF
                                               applies  the  text  transforma-
                                               tions and  inspection  criteria
                                               that  you  defined for the JSON
                                               inspection  to  the  body  text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The  operator  to  use  to  compare  the
                                      request part to the size setting.

                                   Size -> (long)
                                      The  size,  in  byte,  to compare to the
                                      request part, after any transformations.

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection. If you specify one  or
                                      more  transformations  in  a rule state-
                                      ment, WAF performs  all  transformations
                                      on  the content of the request component
                                      identified by  FieldToMatch  ,  starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets   the   relative  processing

                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing  the transformed content. The
                                             priorities don't need to be  con-
                                             secutive,  but  they  must all be
                                             different.

                                          Type -> (string)
                                             You  can  specify  the  following

                                   A  rule  statement  used  to  identify  web
                                   requests based on country of origin.

                                   CountryCodes -> (list)
                                      An array of two-character country codes,
                                      for example, [ "US", "CN" ] ,  from  the
                                      alpha-2  country  ISO  codes  of the ISO

                                   ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration  for  inspecting   IP
                                      addresses  in  an  HTTP  header that you
                                      specify, instead of using the IP address
                                      that's  reported by the web request ori-
                                      gin.  Commonly,  this  is   the   X-For-
                                      warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but  you can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of the HTTP header to use
                                          for the IP address. For example,  to
                                          use    the   X-Forwarded-For   (XFF)
                                          header, set this to  X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are  defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this,
                                   create a rule group with your  rules,  then
                                   provide  the  ARN of the rule group in this
                                   statement.

                                   You cannot nest a  RuleGroupReferenceState-
                                   ment  ,  for  example for use inside a Not-
                                   Statement or OrStatement . You can only use
                                   a rule group reference statement at the top
                                   level inside a web ACL.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      entity.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      The  rules  in the referenced rule group
                                      whose actions are set to  Count  .  When
                                      you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF evaluates it
                                      exactly as it would if the  rule  action
                                      setting  were  Count  . This is a useful
                                      option for testing the rules in  a  rule
                                      group  without modifying how they handle
                                      your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride to Count . When you  exclude  a
                                          rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                                          would if  the  rule  action  setting
                                          were Count . This is a useful option
                                          for testing  the  rules  in  a  rule
                                          group  without  modifying  how  they
                                          handle your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                               IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A   rule   statement  used  to  detect  web
                                   requests   coming   from   particular    IP
                                   addresses  or  address ranges. To use this,
                                   create  an   IPSet   that   specifies   the
                                   addresses  you want to detect, then use the
                                   ARN of that set in this statement. To  cre-
                                   ate an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                                   Each IP set rule statement references an IP
                                   set. You create and maintain the set  inde-
                                   pendent  of  your rules. This allows you to
                                   use the single set in multiple rules.  When
                                   you update the referenced set, WAF automat-
                                   ically updates all rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      IPSet that this statement references.

                                   IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration  for  inspecting   IP
                                      addresses  in  an  HTTP  header that you
                                      specify, instead of using the IP address
                                      that's  reported by the web request ori-
                                      gin.  Commonly,  this  is   the   X-For-
                                      warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but  you can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of the HTTP header to use
                                          for the IP address. For example,  to
                                          use    the   X-Forwarded-For   (XFF)
                                          header, set this to  X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the

                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                      Position -> (string)
                                          The position in the header to search
                                          for  the  IP address. The header can
                                          contain IP addresses of the original
                                          client  and  also  of  proxies.  For
                                          example, the header value  could  be
                                          10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,   10.10.10.10
                                          where the first IP  address  identi-
                                          fies  the  original  client  and the
                                          rest  identify  proxies   that   the
                                          request went through.

                                          The options for this setting are the
                                          following:

                                          o FIRST  -  Inspect  the  first   IP
                                            address   in   the   list   of  IP
                                            addresses in the header.  This  is
                                            usually  the client's original IP.

                                          o LAST - Inspect the last IP address
                                            in the list of IP addresses in the
                                            header.

                                          o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses  in
                                            the  header  for  a  match. If the
                                            header contains more  than  10  IP
                                            addresses,  WAF  inspects the last
                                            10.

                               RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement  ->   (struc-
                               ture)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for matches with regular expres-
                                   sions.  To  use  this,  create a  RegexPat-
                                   ternSet that specifies the expressions that
                                   you  want  to  detect,  then use the ARN of
                                   that set in this statement. A  web  request
                                   matches  the  pattern set rule statement if
                                   the request component matches  any  of  the
                                   patterns in the set. To create a regex pat-
                                   tern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                   Each regex pattern set rule statement  ref-
                                   erences a regex pattern set. You create and
                                   maintain the set independent of your rules.
                                   This  allows  you  to use the single set in
                                   multiple rules. When you update the  refer-
                                   enced  set,  WAF  automatically updates all
                                   rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      RegexPatternSet that this statement ref-
                                      erences.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web  request  component  for  WAF to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The  patterns  to look for in the
                                             JSON  body.  WAF   inspects   the
                                             results  of these pattern matches
                                             against the rule inspection  cri-

                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the  body  as  plain  text. WAF
                                               applies  the  text  transforma-
                                               tions  and  inspection criteria
                                               that you defined for  the  JSON

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection. If you specify one  or
                                      more  transformations  in  a rule state-
                                      ment, WAF performs  all  transformations
                                      on  the content of the request component
                                      identified by  FieldToMatch  ,  starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)

                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-

                                                 BASE64_DECODE   -   Decode  a

                                                 it can help to uncover  ASCII
                                                 characters  that were encoded
                                                 using   CSS   encoding   that
                                                 wouldnt typically be encoded.
                                                 It's also useful in  counter-

                               RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rate-based  rule  tracks  the  rate   of
                                   requests  for  each originating IP address,
                                   and triggers the rule action when the  rate
                                   exceeds  a  limit  that  you specify on the
                                   number of requests  in  any  5-minute  time
                                   span.  You  can use this to put a temporary
                                   block on requests from an IP  address  that
                                   is sending excessive requests.

                                   WAF  tracks  and manages web requests sepa-
                                   rately for each instance  of  a  rate-based
                                   rule that you use. For example, if you pro-
                                   vide the same rate-based rule  settings  in
                                   two  web  ACLs, each of the two rule state-
                                   ments represents a separate instance of the
                                   rate-based  rule  and gets its own tracking
                                   and management by  WAF.  If  you  define  a
                                   rate-based  rule  inside  a rule group, and
                                   then  use  that  rule  group  in   multiple
                                   places,   each   use   creates  a  separate
                                   instance of the rate-based rule  that  gets
                                   its own tracking and management by WAF.

                                   When  the  rule action triggers, WAF blocks
                                   additional requests  from  the  IP  address
                                   until  the  request  rate  falls  below the
                                   limit.

                                   You can optionally nest  another  statement
                                   inside  the rate-based statement, to narrow
                                   the scope of  the  rule  so  that  it  only
                                   counts   requests  that  match  the  nested
                                   statement. For  example,  based  on  recent
                                   requests   that   you  have  seen  from  an
                                   attacker, you  might  create  a  rate-based
                                   rule  with a nested AND rule statement that
                                   contains the following nested statements:

                                   o An IP match statement with an IP set that
                                     specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                   o A string match statement that searches in
                                     the User-Agent header for the string Bad-
                                     Bot.

                                   In  this rate-based rule, you also define a
                                   rate limit.  For  this  example,  the  rate
                                   limit  is 1,000. Requests that meet both of
                                   the  conditions  in  the   statements   are
                                   counted.   If   the   count  exceeds  1,000
                                   requests per five minutes, the rule  action
                                   triggers.  Requests  that  do not meet both
                                   conditions are not counted towards the rate
                                   limit and are not affected by this rule.

                                   You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside
                                   another statement,  for  example  inside  a
                                   NotStatement   or  OrStatement  .  You  can
                                   define a RateBasedStatement  inside  a  web
                                   ACL and inside a rule group.

                                   Limit -> (long)
                                      The   limit  on  requests  per  5-minute
                                      period  for  a  single  originating   IP
                                      address.  If  the  statement  includes a
                                      ScopeDownStatement  ,  this   limit   is
                                      applied  only to the requests that match
                                      the statement.

                                   AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                      Setting that indicates how to  aggregate
                                      the  request counts. The options are the
                                      following:

                                      o IP - Aggregate the request  counts  on
                                        the  IP  address  from the web request
                                        origin.

                                      o FORWARDED_IP - Aggregate  the  request
                                        counts  on  the first IP address in an
                                        HTTP header. If you use this,  config-
                                        ure the ForwardedIPConfig , to specify
                                        the header to use.

                                   ( ... recursive ...  )ForwardedIPConfig  ->
                                   (structure)
                                      The   configuration  for  inspecting  IP
                                      addresses in an  HTTP  header  that  you
                                      specify, instead of using the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      This is required if AggregateKeyType  is
                                      set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of the HTTP header to use
                                          for the IP address. For example,  to
                                          use    the   X-Forwarded-For   (XFF)
                                          header, set this to  X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               AndStatement -> (structure)
                                   A logical rule statement  used  to  combine
                                   other  rule  statements with AND logic. You
                                   provide more than one  Statement within the
                                   AndStatement .

                                   Statements -> (list)
                                      The   statements  to  combine  with  AND
                                      logic. You can use any  statements  that
                                      can be nested.

                                      ( ... recursive ... )

                               OrStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  logical  rule  statement used to combine
                                   other rule statements with  OR  logic.  You
                                   provide more than one  Statement within the
                                   OrStatement .

                                   Statements -> (list)
                                      The statements to combine with OR logic.
                                      You  can  use any statements that can be
                                      nested.

                                      ( ... recursive ... )

                               NotStatement -> (structure)
                                   A logical rule statement used to negate the
                                   results of another rule statement. You pro-
                                   vide one  Statement within the NotStatement
                                   .

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                               ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are defined in a managed rule group. To use
                                   this,  provide the vendor name and the name
                                   of the rule group in  this  statement.  You
                                   can  retrieve the required names by calling
                                   ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                                   You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement
                                   , for example for use inside a NotStatement
                                   or OrStatement . It can only be  referenced
                                   as a top-level statement within a rule.

                                   VendorName -> (string)
                                      The  name of the managed rule group ven-
                                      dor. You use this, along with  the  rule
                                      group  name, to identify the rule group.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the managed rule group.  You
                                      use this, along with the vendor name, to
                                      identify the rule group.

                                   Version -> (string)
                                      The version of the managed rule group to
                                      use.  If  you  specify this, the version
                                      setting is fixed until you change it. If
                                      you  don't  specify  this,  WAF uses the
                                      vendor's default version, and then keeps
                                      the version at the vendor's default when
                                      the  vendor  updates  the  managed  rule
                                      group settings.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      The  rules  in the referenced rule group
                                      whose actions are set to  Count  .  When
                                      you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF evaluates it
                                      exactly as it would if the  rule  action
                                      setting  were  Count  . This is a useful
                                      option for testing the rules in  a  rule
                                      group  without modifying how they handle
                                      your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride to Count . When you  exclude  a
                                          rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                                          would if  the  rule  action  setting
                                          were Count . This is a useful option
                                          for testing  the  rules  in  a  rule
                                          group  without  modifying  how  they
                                          handle your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                               LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule  statement  that  defines  a string
                                   match search against labels that have  been
                                   added to the web request by rules that have
                                   already run in the web ACL.

                                   The  label  match  statement  provides  the
                                   label  or  namespace  string to search for.
                                   The label string can represent  a  part  or
                                   all  of the fully qualified label name that
                                   had been added to the  web  request.  Fully
                                   qualified  labels  have  a prefix, optional
                                   namespaces,  and  label  name.  The  prefix
                                   identifies  the  rule group or web ACL con-
                                   text of the rule that added the  label.  If
                                   you do not provide the fully qualified name
                                   in your label match  string,  WAF  performs
                                   the  search  for  labels that were added in
                                   the same context as the label match  state-
                                   ment.

                                   Scope -> (string)
                                      Specify  whether you want to match using
                                      the label name or just the namespace.

                                   Key -> (string)
                                      The string to match against. The setting
                                      you  provide  for  this  depends  on the
                                      match statement's Scope setting:

                                      o If the Scope indicates  LABEL  ,  then
                                        this  specification  must  include the
                                        name and can  include  any  number  of
                                        preceding namespace specifications and
                                        prefix up to providing the fully qual-
                                        ified label name.

                                      o If  the  Scope  indicates  NAMESPACE ,
                                        then this  specification  can  include
                                        any  number  of  contiguous  namespace
                                        strings, and can  include  the  entire
                                        label  namespace  prefix from the rule
                                        group or web ACL where the label orig-
                                        inates.

                                      Labels are case sensitive and components
                                      of a label must be separated  by  colon,
                                      for example NS1:NS2:name .

                               RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for a  match  against  a  single
                                   regular expression.

                                   RegexString -> (string)
                                      The   string  representing  the  regular
                                      expression.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web  request  component  for  WAF to
                                          inspect, in the  FieldToMatch speci-
                                          fication.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement         that
                                          enforces  an  8 KB size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The  patterns  to look for in the
                                             JSON  body.  WAF   inspects   the
                                             results  of these pattern matches
                                             against the rule inspection  cri-
                                             teria.

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match  all  of  the elements.

                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match   only   the  specified

                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the  body  as  plain  text. WAF
                                               applies  the  text  transforma-
                                               tions  and  inspection criteria
                                               that you defined for  the  JSON

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection. If you specify one  or
                                      more  transformations  in  a rule state-
                                      ment, WAF performs  all  transformations
                                      on  the content of the request component
                                      identified by  FieldToMatch  ,  starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing  the transformed content. The

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             transformation types:
                                                 BASE64_DECODE   -   Decode  a

                     NotStatement -> (structure)
                        A logical rule statement used to negate the results of
                        another  rule  statement.  You  provide one  Statement
                        within the NotStatement .

                        Statement -> (structure)
                            The statement to negate. You can use any statement
                            that can be nested.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this  is  ref-
                               ered to as a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 50 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type   of   operation  specified  in  the
                                     request.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The  maximum  length  of  the value
                                   before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode     BadBot     using     MIME
                                   base64-encoding  and  include the resulting
                                   value, QmFkQm90 , in the value  of  Search-
                                   String .
                                      If  you're  using  the CLI or one of the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The value that you want WAF to search  for.
                                   The  SDK  automatically  base64 encodes the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations.  These  are  helpful  in

                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE         also
                                             replaces multiple spaces with one

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                             combination  of  a  backslash and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,      ja\vascript     for

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                          o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                             MD5  - Calculate an MD5 hash from
                                             the data in the input.  The  com-
                                             puted  hash  is  in  a raw binary
                                             form.

                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                   request  that  you  want  WAF to search for
                                   SearchString .  Valid  values  include  the
                                   following:

                                   The  specified part of the web request must
                                   include the value of SearchString , but the
                                   location doesn't matter.

                                   The  specified part of the web request must
                                   include the value  of  SearchString  ,  and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric

                                   _).  In  addition,  SearchString  must be a
                                   word, which means that both of the  follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString  is  at the beginning of the

                                     preceded  by  a  character  other than an
                                     alphanumeric character or underscore (_).
                                     Examples  include  the  value of a header
                                     and ;BadBot .

                                   o SearchString is at the end of the  speci-

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               Attackers sometimes insert malicious  SQL  code
                               into  web requests in an effort to extract data
                               from your  database.  To  allow  or  block  web
                               requests  that  appear to contain malicious SQL
                               code, create one or more  SQL  injection  match
                               conditions.  An  SQL  injection match condition
                               identifies the part of web  requests,  such  as
                               the  URI or the query string, that you want WAF
                               to inspect. Later in the process, when you cre-
                               ate  a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or
                               block requests that appear to contain malicious
                               SQL code.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a

                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,

                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             LOWERCASE  -  Convert   uppercase

                                             ning of the input from  an  input
                                             string.

                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             occurrence of a  C-style  comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple consecutive  occurrences
                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             If  the code is in the full-width
                                             ASCII code range of  FF01-FF5E  ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  defines  a cross-site
                               scripting (XSS) match search for WAF  to  apply
                               to  web  requests.  XSS attacks are those where
                               the attacker uses vulnerabilities in  a  benign
                               website   as  a  vehicle  to  inject  malicious
                               client-site scripts into other  legitimate  web
                               browsers.  The XSS match statement provides the
                               location in  requests  that  you  want  WAF  to
                               search  and  text transformations to use on the
                               search area before WAF searches  for  character
                               sequences  that  are  likely  to  be  malicious
                               strings.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192

                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a

                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional

                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations.  These  are  helpful  in

                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                             combination  of  a  backslash and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,      ja\vascript     for

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of
                                             hexadecimal   characters  into  a

                                             code is in the  full-width  ASCII
                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                             standalone  termination of a com-

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             If the code is in the  full-width
                                             ASCII  code  range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-

                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion, and minimizing  false-posi-
                                             tives   and  false-negatives  for

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement  that  compares  a  number  of
                               bytes  against the size of a request component,
                               using a comparison operator,  such  as  greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use a size constraint  statement  to  look  for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If  you  configure  WAF  to inspect the request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB).  If the request body for your web requests
                               never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size
                               constraint  condition  and  block requests that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If you choose URI for the value of Part of  the
                               request  to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI
                               counts as one character. For example,  the  URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-

                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional

                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to
                                                 include all  paths.  Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte,  to  compare  to  the
                                   request part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             that were encoded using  CSS  2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters . This function uses  up  to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can   help   to
                                             uncover   ASCII  characters  that
                                             were encoded using  CSS  encoding
                                             that    wouldnt    typically   be
                                             encoded.  It's  also  useful   in
                                             countering  evasion,  which  is a
                                             combination of  a  backslash  and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,     ja\vascript      for
                                             javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             sequences: \a , \b , \f , \n , \r
                                             , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' ,  \"  ,
                                             \xHH     (hexadecimal),     \0OOO
                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of
                                             hexadecimal  characters  into   a
                                             binary.

                                             HTML-encoded   characters    with
                                             unencoded             characters.
                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                          o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                          o Replaces  (ampersand)nbsp;  with a
                                            non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                          o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with   a
                                            "less than" symbol

                                          o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                          o Replaces  characters that are rep-
                                            resented  in  hexadecimal  format,
                                            (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the cor-

                                             code  is  in the full-width ASCII
                                             code range of  FF01-FF5E  ,  then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             LOWERCASE  -  Convert   uppercase

                                             MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash  from
                                             the  data  in the input. The com-
                                             puted hash is  in  a  raw  binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE  - Specify NONE if you don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS  -  Replace each
                                             occurrence of a  C-style  comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple consecutive  occurrences
                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule statement used to identify web requests
                               based on country of origin.

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An array of  two-character  country  codes,
                                   for  example,  [  "US",  "CN"  ] , from the
                                   alpha-2 country ISO codes of the  ISO  3166
                                   international standard.

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching   the   rule  statement.  WAF
                                        applies  the  rule   action   to   the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule group with your rules,  then  provide  the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  You  can  only use a rule group
                               reference statement at the top level  inside  a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   entity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to  detect  web  requests
                               coming  from particular IP addresses or address
                               ranges. To use  this,  create  an   IPSet  that
                               specifies  the  addresses  you  want to detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each  IP  set  rule  statement references an IP
                               set. You create and maintain the  set  indepen-
                               dent  of your rules. This allows you to use the
                               single set in multiple rules. When  you  update
                               the  referenced  set, WAF automatically updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching   the   rule  statement.  WAF
                                        applies  the  rule   action   to   the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the  IP  address. The header can contain
                                      IP addresses of the original client  and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value  could  be  10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10  where  the first IP address
                                      identifies the original client  and  the
                                      rest  identify  proxies that the request
                                      went through.

                                      The options for  this  setting  are  the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address
                                        in the list of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.  This  is usually the client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST - Inspect the last IP address  in
                                        the   list  of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in  the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains more than 10 IP  addresses,  WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for  matches  with  regular  expres-
                               sions.  To  use this, create a  RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect,  then  use  the ARN of that set in this
                               statement. A web request  matches  the  pattern
                               set  rule  statement  if  the request component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate  a  regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each regex pattern set  rule  statement  refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain the set independent of  your  rules.  This
                               allows  you  to  use the single set in multiple
                               rules. When you update the referenced set,  WAF
                               automatically  updates all rules that reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in

                                             form.

                                             NONE - Specify NONE if you  don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH  - Remove multiple
                                             slashes,  directory   self-refer-
                                             ences,  and directory back-refer-
                                             ences that are not at the  begin-
                                             ning  of  the input from an input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all NULL
                                             bytes from the input.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS -  Replace  each
                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.

                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                             standalone  termination of a com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS  -   Replace   NULL
                                             bytes  in  the  input  with space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             ,   but    with    support    for

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A rate-based rule tracks the rate  of  requests
                               for  each  originating IP address, and triggers
                               the rule action when the rate exceeds  a  limit
                               that  you  specify on the number of requests in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a  temporary  block  on  requests  from  an  IP
                               address that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF tracks and manages web requests  separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use. For  example,  if  you  provide  the  same
                               rate-based  rule settings in two web ACLs, each
                               of the two rule statements represents  a  sepa-
                               rate  instance  of the rate-based rule and gets
                               its own tracking and management by WAF. If  you
                               define  a  rate-based rule inside a rule group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the rate-based rule that gets its own  tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional requests from the IP address  until  the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You   can  optionally  nest  another  statement
                               inside the rate-based statement, to narrow  the
                               scope  of  the  rule  so  that  it  only counts
                               requests that match the nested  statement.  For
                               example, based on recent requests that you have
                               seen from  an  attacker,  you  might  create  a
                               rate-based  rule  with a nested AND rule state-
                               ment that contains the following nested  state-
                               ments:

                               o An  IP  match  statement  with an IP set that
                                 specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit. For this  example,  the  rate  limit  is
                               1,000.  Requests  that  meet both of the condi-
                               tions in the statements  are  counted.  If  the
                               count  exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes,
                               the rule action triggers. Requests that do  not
                               meet  both  conditions  are not counted towards
                               the rate limit and are  not  affected  by  this
                               rule.

                               You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement inside
                               another statement, for example  inside  a  Not-
                               Statement  or  OrStatement  .  You can define a
                               RateBasedStatement inside a web ACL and  inside
                               a rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The  limit  on requests per 5-minute period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement  includes  a ScopeDownStatement ,
                                   this limit is applied only to the  requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header. If you use  this,  configure  the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               (  ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig   ->
                               (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule   statement.   WAF
                                        applies   the   rule   action  to  the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with  AND  logic.  You  provide
                               more  than  one  Statement within the AndState-
                               ment .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine with  AND  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            OrStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to combine  other
                               rule statements with OR logic. You provide more
                               than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine  with  OR  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            NotStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement  used  to  negate  the
                               results  of another rule statement. You provide
                               one  Statement within the NotStatement .

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined  in  a managed rule group. To use this,
                               provide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the
                               rule  group in this statement. You can retrieve
                               the required names by calling   ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You  cannot  nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  It  can only be referenced as a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group  vendor.
                                   You  use  this,  along  with the rule group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this,  along with the vendor name, to iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The version of the managed  rule  group  to
                                   use.  If you specify this, the version set-
                                   ting is fixed until you change it.  If  you
                                   don't  specify  this, WAF uses the vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at  the  vendor's  default  when the vendor
                                   updates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  against  labels that have been added to
                               the web request by rules that have already  run
                               in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                               prefix  identifies  the  rule  group or web ACL
                               context of the rule that added  the  label.  If
                               you  do not provide the fully qualified name in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search  for  labels that were added in the same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  string  to  match against. The setting
                                   you provide for this depends on  the  match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this
                                     specification must include the  name  and
                                     can   include  any  number  of  preceding
                                     namespace specifications and prefix up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE  ,  then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of contiguous namespace strings, and  can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from the rule group or web ACL where  the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be  separated  by  colon,  for
                                   example NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                             combination  of  a  backslash and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,      ja\vascript     for
                                             javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             sequences: \a , \b , \f , \n , \r
                                             ,  \t  , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \" ,

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of
                                             hexadecimal   characters  into  a
                                             binary.

                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE   -    Replace
                                             HTML-encoded    characters   with
                                             unencoded             characters.
                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                             escape sequences. If a \  u  HHHH
                                             code is in the  full-width  ASCII
                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             LOWERCASE   -  Convert  uppercase

                                             MD5  - Calculate an MD5 hash from
                                             the data in the input.  The  com-
                                             puted  hash  is  in  a raw binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE - Specify NONE if you  don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH  - Remove multiple
                                             slashes,  directory   self-refer-
                                             ences,  and directory back-refer-

                                             ning  of  the input from an input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all NULL

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS -  Replace  each
                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                             standalone  termination of a com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS  -   Replace   NULL
                                             bytes  in  the  input  with space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             ,   but    with    support    for
                                             Microsoft-specific  %u  encoding.
                                             If the code is in the  full-width
                                             ASCII  code  range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect

                     ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement  used  to  run  the  rules  that  are
                        defined  in a managed rule group. To use this, provide
                        the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this
                        statement.  You  can  retrieve  the  required names by
                        calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                        You cannot  nest  a  ManagedRuleGroupStatement  ,  for
                        example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        It can only be referenced  as  a  top-level  statement
                        within a rule.

                        VendorName -> (string)
                            The name of the managed rule group vendor. You use
                            this, along with the rule group name, to  identify
                            the rule group.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name of the managed rule group. You use this,
                            along with the vendor name, to identify  the  rule
                            group.

                        Version -> (string)
                            The  version  of the managed rule group to use. If
                            you specify this, the  version  setting  is  fixed
                            until  you  change  it. If you don't specify this,
                            WAF uses the vendor's default  version,  and  then
                            keeps the version at the vendor's default when the
                            vendor updates the managed rule group settings.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group  whose
                            actions  are  set  to  Count  . When you exclude a
                            rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                            rule  action setting were Count . This is a useful
                            option for testing the rules in a rule group with-
                            out modifying how they handle your web traffic.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies  a  single rule in a rule group whose
                               action you want to override to Count . When you
                               exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                               would if the rule action setting were  Count  .
                               This  is  a useful option for testing the rules
                               in a rule group without modifying how they han-
                               dle your web traffic.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                        ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                            An optional  nested  statement  that  narrows  the
                            scope  of  the  web requests that are evaluated by
                            the managed rule group. Requests are  only  evalu-
                            ated   by   the  rule  group  if  they  match  the
                            scope-down statement. You  can  use  any  nestable
                            Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can
                            nest statements at any level, the same as you  can
                            for a rule statement.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this  is  ref-
                               ered to as a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 50 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type   of   operation  specified  in  the
                                     request.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The  maximum  length  of  the value
                                   before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode     BadBot     using     MIME
                                   base64-encoding  and  include the resulting
                                   value, QmFkQm90 , in the value  of  Search-
                                   String .
                                      If  you're  using  the CLI or one of the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The value that you want WAF to search  for.
                                   The  SDK  automatically  base64 encodes the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations.  These  are  helpful  in
                                             reducing effectiveness of attack-
                                             ers who inject an operating  sys-

                                             unusual  formatting  to  disguise
                                             some or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following

                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                          o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                          o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE         also
                                             replaces multiple spaces with one
                                             space.

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that  were  encoded using CSS 2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                             combination  of  a  backslash and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,      ja\vascript     for
                                             javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the
                                             following     ANSI    C    escape

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of
                                             hexadecimal   characters  into  a
                                             binary.

                                             HTML-encoded    characters   with
                                             unencoded             characters.
                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                          o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                             the data in the input.  The  com-
                                             puted  hash  is  in  a raw binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE - Specify NONE if you  don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH  - Remove multiple
                                             slashes,  directory   self-refer-

                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-

                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                             standalone  termination of a com-

                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             ,   but    with    support    for
                                             Microsoft-specific  %u  encoding.
                                             If the code is in the  full-width
                                             ASCII  code  range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all

                               PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                                   The  area  within  the  portion  of  a  web
                                   request  that  you  want  WAF to search for
                                   SearchString .  Valid  values  include  the
                                   following:
                                      CONTAINS

                                   The  specified part of the web request must
                                   include the value of SearchString , but the
                                   location doesn't matter.
                                      CONTAINS_WORD

                                   The  specified part of the web request must
                                   include the value  of  SearchString  ,  and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric
                                   characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
                                   _).  In  addition,  SearchString  must be a
                                   word, which means that both of the  follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString  is  at the beginning of the
                                     specified part of the web request  or  is
                                     preceded  by  a  character  other than an
                                     alphanumeric character or underscore (_).
                                     Examples  include  the  value of a header
                                     and ;BadBot .

                                   o SearchString is at the end of the  speci-

                                     alphanumeric character or underscore (_),
                                     for example, BadBot; and -BadBot; .
                                      EXACTLY

                                   The value of the specified part of the  web
                                   request  must  exactly  match  the value of

                                   The value of SearchString  must  appear  at
                                   the  end  of  the specified part of the web
                                   request.

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               Attackers sometimes insert malicious  SQL  code
                               into  web requests in an effort to extract data
                               from your  database.  To  allow  or  block  web
                               requests  that  appear to contain malicious SQL
                               code, create one or more  SQL  injection  match
                               conditions.  An  SQL  injection match condition
                               identifies the part of web  requests,  such  as
                               the  URI or the query string, that you want WAF
                               to inspect. Later in the process, when you cre-
                               ate  a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or
                               block requests that appear to contain malicious
                               SQL code.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,

                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an

                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to
                                                 include all  paths.  Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             process,  so  it  can   help   to
                                             uncover   ASCII  characters  that
                                             were encoded using  CSS  encoding
                                             that    wouldnt    typically   be
                                             encoded.  It's  also  useful   in

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  defines  a cross-site
                               scripting (XSS) match search for WAF  to  apply
                               to  web  requests.  XSS attacks are those where
                               the attacker uses vulnerabilities in  a  benign
                               website   as  a  vehicle  to  inject  malicious
                               client-site scripts into other  legitimate  web
                               browsers.  The XSS match statement provides the
                               location in  requests  that  you  want  WAF  to
                               search  and  text transformations to use on the
                               search area before WAF searches  for  character
                               sequences  that  are  likely  to  be  malicious
                               strings.

                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding

                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement  that  compares  a  number  of
                               bytes  against the size of a request component,
                               using a comparison operator,  such  as  greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use a size constraint  statement  to  look  for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If  you  configure  WAF  to inspect the request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB).  If the request body for your web requests
                               never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size
                               constraint  condition  and  block requests that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If you choose URI for the value of Part of  the
                               request  to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI
                               counts as one character. For example,  the  URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to
                                                 include all  paths.  Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte,  to  compare  to  the
                                   request part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             process,  so  it  can   help   to
                                             uncover   ASCII  characters  that
                                             were encoded using  CSS  encoding
                                             that    wouldnt    typically   be

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of

                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             NONE  - Specify NONE if you don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH - Remove  multiple
                                             slashes,   directory  self-refer-
                                             ences, and directory  back-refer-
                                             ences  that are not at the begin-
                                             ning of the input from  an  input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is the
                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS -  Remove  all  NULL
                                             bytes from the input.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS  -  Replace each
                                             occurrence of a  C-style  comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple consecutive  occurrences
                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS   -   Replace  NULL
                                             bytes in  the  input  with  space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode SQL hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE
                                             ,    but    with    support   for
                                             Microsoft-specific  %u  encoding.
                                             If  the code is in the full-width
                                             ASCII code range of  FF01-FF5E  ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert   all
                                             UTF-8 character sequences to Uni-
                                             code. This helps input normaliza-

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule statement used to identify web requests
                               based on country of origin.

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An array of  two-character  country  codes,
                                   for  example,  [  "US",  "CN"  ] , from the
                                   alpha-2 country ISO codes of the  ISO  3166
                                   international standard.

                                   (string)

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching   the   rule  statement.  WAF
                                        applies  the  rule   action   to   the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule group with your rules,  then  provide  the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  You  can  only use a rule group
                               reference statement at the top level  inside  a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   entity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to  detect  web  requests
                               coming  from particular IP addresses or address
                               ranges. To use  this,  create  an   IPSet  that
                               specifies  the  addresses  you  want to detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each  IP  set  rule  statement references an IP
                               set. You create and maintain the  set  indepen-
                               dent  of your rules. This allows you to use the
                               single set in multiple rules. When  you  update
                               the  referenced  set, WAF automatically updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching   the   rule  statement.  WAF
                                        applies  the  rule   action   to   the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the  IP  address. The header can contain
                                      IP addresses of the original client  and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value  could  be  10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10  where  the first IP address
                                      identifies the original client  and  the
                                      rest  identify  proxies that the request
                                      went through.

                                      The options for  this  setting  are  the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address
                                        in the list of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.  This  is usually the client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST - Inspect the last IP address  in
                                        the   list  of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in  the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains more than 10 IP  addresses,  WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for  matches  with  regular  expres-
                               sions.  To  use this, create a  RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect,  then  use  the ARN of that set in this
                               statement. A web request  matches  the  pattern
                               set  rule  statement  if  the request component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate  a  regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each regex pattern set  rule  statement  refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain the set independent of  your  rules.  This
                               allows  you  to  use the single set in multiple
                               rules. When you update the referenced set,  WAF
                               automatically  updates all rules that reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded

                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to

                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations.  These  are  helpful  in

                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                             combination  of  a  backslash and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of
                                             hexadecimal   characters  into  a
                                             binary.

                                             unencoded             characters.
                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A rate-based rule tracks the rate  of  requests
                               for  each  originating IP address, and triggers
                               the rule action when the rate exceeds  a  limit
                               that  you  specify on the number of requests in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a  temporary  block  on  requests  from  an  IP
                               address that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF tracks and manages web requests  separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use. For  example,  if  you  provide  the  same
                               rate-based  rule settings in two web ACLs, each
                               of the two rule statements represents  a  sepa-
                               rate  instance  of the rate-based rule and gets
                               its own tracking and management by WAF. If  you
                               define  a  rate-based rule inside a rule group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the rate-based rule that gets its own  tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional requests from the IP address  until  the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You   can  optionally  nest  another  statement
                               inside the rate-based statement, to narrow  the
                               scope  of  the  rule  so  that  it  only counts
                               requests that match the nested  statement.  For
                               example, based on recent requests that you have
                               seen from  an  attacker,  you  might  create  a
                               rate-based  rule  with a nested AND rule state-
                               ment that contains the following nested  state-
                               ments:

                               o An  IP  match  statement  with an IP set that
                                 specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit. For this  example,  the  rate  limit  is
                               1,000.  Requests  that  meet both of the condi-
                               tions in the statements  are  counted.  If  the
                               count  exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes,
                               the rule action triggers. Requests that do  not
                               meet  both  conditions  are not counted towards
                               the rate limit and are  not  affected  by  this
                               rule.

                               You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement inside
                               another statement, for example  inside  a  Not-
                               Statement  or  OrStatement  .  You can define a
                               RateBasedStatement inside a web ACL and  inside
                               a rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The  limit  on requests per 5-minute period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement  includes  a ScopeDownStatement ,
                                   this limit is applied only to the  requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header. If you use  this,  configure  the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               (  ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig   ->
                               (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule   statement.   WAF
                                        applies   the   rule   action  to  the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with  AND  logic.  You  provide
                               more  than  one  Statement within the AndState-
                               ment .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine with  AND  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            OrStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to combine  other
                               rule statements with OR logic. You provide more
                               than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine  with  OR  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            NotStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement  used  to  negate  the
                               results  of another rule statement. You provide
                               one  Statement within the NotStatement .

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined  in  a managed rule group. To use this,
                               provide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the
                               rule  group in this statement. You can retrieve
                               the required names by calling   ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You  cannot  nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  It  can only be referenced as a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group  vendor.
                                   You  use  this,  along  with the rule group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this,  along with the vendor name, to iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The version of the managed  rule  group  to
                                   use.  If you specify this, the version set-
                                   ting is fixed until you change it.  If  you
                                   don't  specify  this, WAF uses the vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at  the  vendor's  default  when the vendor
                                   updates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  against  labels that have been added to
                               the web request by rules that have already  run
                               in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                               prefix  identifies  the  rule  group or web ACL
                               context of the rule that added  the  label.  If
                               you  do not provide the fully qualified name in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search  for  labels that were added in the same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  string  to  match against. The setting
                                   you provide for this depends on  the  match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this
                                     specification must include the  name  and
                                     can   include  any  number  of  preceding
                                     namespace specifications and prefix up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE  ,  then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of contiguous namespace strings, and  can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from the rule group or web ACL where  the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be  separated  by  colon,  for
                                   example NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the

                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a

                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that

                     LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement that defines a  string  match  search
                        against labels that have been added to the web request
                        by rules that have already run in the web ACL.

                        The label match statement provides the label or names-
                        pace string to search for. The label string can repre-
                        sent a part or all of the fully qualified  label  name
                        that  had  been added to the web request. Fully quali-
                        fied labels have a prefix,  optional  namespaces,  and
                        label  name.  The  prefix identifies the rule group or
                        web ACL context of the rule that added the  label.  If
                        you  do  not  provide the fully qualified name in your
                        label match string, WAF performs the search for labels
                        that were added in the same context as the label match
                        statement.

                        Scope -> (string)
                            Specify whether you want to match using the  label
                            name or just the namespace.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  string to match against. The setting you pro-
                            vide for this depends  on  the  match  statement's
                            Scope setting:

                            o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this speci-
                              fication must include the name and  can  include
                              any number of preceding namespace specifications
                              and prefix up to providing the  fully  qualified
                              label name.

                            o If  the  Scope  indicates  NAMESPACE , then this
                              specification can include any number of contigu-
                              ous  namespace  strings,  and  can  include  the
                              entire label  namespace  prefix  from  the  rule
                              group or web ACL where the label originates.

                            Labels  are  case  sensitive  and  components of a
                            label must be  separated  by  colon,  for  example
                            NS1:NS2:name .

                     RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to search web request components
                        for a match against a single regular expression.

                        RegexString -> (string)
                            The string representing the regular expression.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that  you  want  WAF  to
                            inspect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to  inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of a web request that  identifies  a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body  as  plain  text.  The
                               request  body  immediately  follows the request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF  for
                               inspection  by  the underlying host service. If
                               you don't need to inspect more than 8  KB,  you
                               can  guarantee  that you don't allow additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the  body  of  the web request, such as  ByteM-
                               atchStatement  or    RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of  the
                               request.  WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting the
                               entire contents of web  requests  whose  bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body  are  forwarded  to  WAF for
                               inspection by the underlying host  service.  If
                               you  don't  need to inspect more than 8 KB, you
                               can guarantee that you don't  allow  additional
                               bytes in by combining a statement that inspects
                               the body of the web request,  such  as   ByteM-
                               atchStatement   or   RegexPatternSetReferenceS-
                               tatement , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that
                               enforces  an 8 KB size limit on the body of the
                               request. WAF  doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                               entire  contents  of  web requests whose bodies
                               exceed the 8 KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the   Internet  Engineering  Task  Force
                                      (IETF) documentation  JavaScript  Object
                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of  the  JSON  to  match  against
                                   using the MatchPattern . If you specify All
                                   , WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection. If you specify  one
                            or  more  transformations in a rule statement, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request  component  identified  by  FieldToMatch ,
                            starting from the lowest priority setting,  before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations  eliminate  some  of  the
                               unusual formatting that attackers  use  in  web
                               requests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations that are defined  for
                                   a  rule statement. WAF processes all trans-
                                   formations, from lowest priority  to  high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent. The priorities don't need to be  con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You  can  specify the following transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -  Decode  a  Base64
                                      -encoded string,  but  use  a  forgiving
                                      implementation  that  ignores characters
                                      that aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness of attackers who inject an  operat-
                                      ing  system command-line command and use
                                      unusual formatting to disguise  some  or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -  Replace   these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules  syn-
                                      data.html#characters   .  This  function
                                      uses up to two  bytes  in  the  decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters that were encoded  using  CSS
                                      encoding   that   wouldnt  typically  be
                                      encoded. It's also useful in  countering
                                      evasion,  which  is  a  combination of a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters.   For   example,  ja\vascript  for
                                      javascript.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,

                                      \xHH   (hexadecimal),   \0OOO   (octal).
                                      Encodings that aren't  valid  remain  in
                                      the output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE       -       Replace
                                      HTML-encoded  characters  with unencoded
                                      characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs
                                      these operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a   "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE  -  Decode  JavaScript  escape
                                      sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is  in
                                      the   full-width  ASCII  code  range  of
                                      FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte is used
                                      to  detect and adjust the lower byte. If
                                      not, only the lower byte is used and the
                                      higher  byte is zeroed, causing a possi-
                                      ble loss of information.

                                      LOWERCASE -  Convert  uppercase  letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5  -  Calculate  an  MD5 hash from the
                                      data in the input. The computed hash  is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE  -  Specify  NONE if you don't want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   -    Remove    multiple
                                      slashes,  directory self-references, and
                                      directory back-references that  are  not
                                      at  the  beginning  of the input from an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   ,  but  first  converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive  occurrences  are  not  compressed.
                                      Unterminated comments are also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE  ,  but
                                      with  support  for Microsoft-specific %u
                                      encoding.  If  the  code   is   in   the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                      adjust  the  lower byte. Otherwise, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all  UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps  input normalization, and minimiz-
                                      ing false-positives and  false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                 Action -> (structure)
                     The  action that WAF should take on a web request when it
                     matches the rule statement. Settings at the web ACL level
                     can override the rule action setting.

                     This  is used only for rules whose statements do not ref-
                     erence a rule group. Rule  statements  that  reference  a
                     rule  group  include RuleGroupReferenceStatement and Man-
                     agedRuleGroupStatement .

                     You must specify either this Action setting or  the  rule
                     OverrideAction setting, but not both:

                     o If  the rule statement does not reference a rule group,
                       use this rule action setting and not the rule  override
                       action setting.

                     o If  the rule statement references a rule group, use the
                       override action setting and not this action setting.

                     Block -> (structure)
                        Instructs WAF to block the web request.

                        CustomResponse -> (structure)
                            Defines a custom response for the web request.

                            For information about customizing web requests and
                            responses,   see   Customizing  web  requests  and
                            responses in WAF in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            ResponseCode -> (integer)
                               The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                               For a list of status codes that you can use  in
                               your  custom  reqponses,  see  Supported status
                               codes for custom response in the WAF  Developer
                               Guide .

                            CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)
                               References  the response body that you want WAF
                               to return to the web request  client.  You  can
                               define a custom response for a rule action or a
                               default web ACL action that is set to block. To
                               do this, you first define the response body key
                               and value in the  CustomResponseBodies  setting
                               for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to
                               use it. Then, in the rule  action  or  web  ACL
                               default  action BlockAction setting, you refer-
                               ence the response body using this key.

                            ResponseHeaders -> (list)
                               The HTTP headers to use in the response. Dupli-
                               cate header names are not allowed.

                               For  information  about the limits on count and
                               size for custom request and response  settings,
                               see WAF quotas in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               (structure)
                                   A  custom  header  for  custom  request and
                                   response handling. This is used in  Custom-
                                   Response and  CustomRequestHandling .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the custom header.

                                      For  custom  request  header  insertion,
                                      when WAF inserts  the  header  into  the
                                      request,    it    prefixes   this   name
                                      x-amzn-waf- , to  avoid  confusion  with
                                      the  headers  that  are  already  in the
                                      request. For  example,  for  the  header
                                      name  sample  ,  WAF  inserts the header
                                      x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The value of the custom header.

                     Allow -> (structure)
                        Instructs WAF to allow the web request.

                        CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)

                                      For  custom  request  header  insertion,
                                      when WAF inserts  the  header  into  the
                                      request,    it    prefixes   this   name
                                      x-amzn-waf- , to  avoid  confusion  with
                                      the  headers  that  are  already  in the
                                      request. For  example,  for  the  header
                                      name  sample  ,  WAF  inserts the header
                                      x-amzn-waf-sample .

                 OverrideAction -> (structure)
                     The action to use in the place of the action that results
                     from the rule group evaluation. Set the  override  action
                     to  none to leave the result of the rule group alone. Set
                     it to count to override the result to count only.

                     You can only use this for rule statements that  reference
                     a  rule  group, like RuleGroupReferenceStatement and Man-
                     agedRuleGroupStatement .

                     NOTE:
                        This option is usually set to none. It does not affect
                        how  the rules in the rule group are evaluated. If you
                        want the  rules  in  the  rule  group  to  only  count
                        matches,  do  not  use  this and instead exclude those
                        rules in your rule group reference statement settings.

                     Count -> (structure)
                        Override  the  rule  group  evaluation result to count
                        only.

                        NOTE:
                            This option is usually set to none.  It  does  not
                            affect  how the rules in the rule group are evalu-
                            ated. If you want the rules in the rule  group  to
                            only  count  matches,  do not use this and instead
                            exclude those rules in your rule  group  reference
                            statement settings.

                        CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)

                               (structure)
                                   A custom  header  for  custom  request  and
                                   response handling. This is used in  Custom-
                                   Response and  CustomRequestHandling .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the custom header.

                                      For  custom  request  header  insertion,
                                      when  WAF  inserts  the  header into the
                                      request,   it   prefixes    this    name
                                      x-amzn-waf-  ,  to  avoid confusion with
                                      the headers  that  are  already  in  the
                                      request.  For  example,  for  the header
                                      name sample ,  WAF  inserts  the  header
                                      x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The value of the custom header.

                     None -> (structure)
                        Don't  override the rule group evaluation result. This
                        is the most common setting.

                 RuleLabels -> (list)
                     Labels to apply to web requests that match the rule match
                     statement. WAF applies fully qualified labels to matching
                     web requests. A fully qualified label is  the  concatena-
                     tion  of  a  label namespace and a rule label. The rule's
                     rule group or web ACL defines the label namespace.

                     Rules that run after this rule in the web ACL  can  match
                     against these labels using a LabelMatchStatement .

                     For  each label, provide a case-sensitive string contain-
                     ing optional namespaces and a label  name,  according  to
                     the following guidelines:

                     o Separate each component of the label with a colon.

                     o Each namespace or name can have up to 128 characters.

                     o You can specify up to 5 namespaces in a label.

                     o Don't  use  the  following reserved words in your label
                       specification: aws , waf , managed , rulegroup , webacl
                       , regexpatternset , or ipset .

                     For  example,  myLabelName or nameSpace1:nameSpace2:myLa-
                     belName .

                     (structure)
                        A single label container. This is used as  an  element
                        of a label array in multiple contexts, for example, in
                        RuleLabels inside a  Rule and in Labels inside a  Sam-
                        pledHTTPRequest .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The label string.

                        A boolean indicating whether WAF should store  a  sam-
                        pling  of  the  web requests that match the rules. You
                        can view the sampled requests through the WAF console.

                     CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                        A  boolean  indicating whether the associated resource
                        sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. For  the  list  of
                        available metrics, see WAF Metrics .

                        (hyphen), and _ (underscore). The name can be from one
                        to 128 characters long. It can't contain whitespace or
                        metric  names  reserved for WAF, for example "All" and
                        "Default_Action."

                 CaptchaConfig -> (structure)
                     Specifies how WAF should handle CAPTCHA  evaluations.  If
                     you  don't  specify this, WAF uses the CAPTCHA configura-
                     tion that's defined for the web ACL.

                     ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
                        Determines how long  a  CAPTCHA  token  remains  valid
                        after the client successfully solves a CAPTCHA puzzle.

                        ImmunityTime -> (long)
                            The amount of time, in  seconds,  that  a  CAPTCHA

                 A boolean indicating whether WAF should store a  sampling  of
                 the  web requests that match the rules. You can view the sam-
                 pled requests through the WAF console.

              CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A boolean indicating whether the  associated  resource  sends
                 metrics  to Amazon CloudWatch. For the list of available met-
                 rics, see WAF Metrics .

              MetricName -> (string)
                 A name of the Amazon CloudWatch metric. The name can  contain
                 only the characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - (hyphen), and _ (under-
                 score). The name can be from one to 128 characters  long.  It
                 can't  contain  whitespace  or metric names reserved for WAF,
                 for example "All" and "Default_Action."

          Capacity -> (long)
              The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) currently being used  by  this
              web ACL.

              WAF  uses  WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources
              that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs.  WAF
              calculates  capacity  differently for each rule type, to reflect
              the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to
              run  use  fewer  WCUs than more complex rules that use more pro-
              cessing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at  creation,  which
              helps  users  plan  their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule
              group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500.

          PreProcessFirewallManagerRuleGroups -> (list)
              The first set of rules for WAF to process in the web  ACL.  This
              is  defined  in an Firewall Manager WAF policy and contains only
              rule group references. You can't alter these. Any rules and rule
              groups  that  you  define  for the web ACL are prioritized after
              these.

              In the Firewall Manager WAF policy, the Firewall Manager  admin-
              istrator can define a set of rule groups to run first in the web
              ACL and a set of rule groups to run last. Within each  set,  the
              administrator  prioritizes  the  rule groups, to determine their
              relative processing order.

              (structure)
                 A rule group that's defined for an Firewall Manager WAF  pol-
                 icy.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the rule group. You cannot change the name of
                     a rule group after you create it.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     If you define more than one rule group in  the  first  or
                     last  Firewall  Manager  rule  groups, WAF evaluates each
                     request against the rule groups in order,  starting  from
                     the lowest priority setting. The priorities don't need to
                     be consecutive, but they must all be different.

                 FirewallManagerStatement -> (structure)
                     The processing guidance for  an  Firewall  Manager  rule.
                     This  is like a regular rule  Statement , but it can only
                     contain a rule group reference.

                     ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement  used  to  run  the  rules  that  are
                        defined  in a managed rule group. To use this, provide
                        the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this
                        statement.  You  can  retrieve  the  required names by
                        calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                        You cannot  nest  a  ManagedRuleGroupStatement  ,  for
                        example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        It can only be referenced  as  a  top-level  statement
                        within a rule.

                        VendorName -> (string)
                            The name of the managed rule group vendor. You use
                            this, along with the rule group name, to  identify
                            the rule group.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name of the managed rule group. You use this,
                            along with the vendor name, to identify  the  rule
                            group.

                        Version -> (string)
                            The  version  of the managed rule group to use. If
                            you specify this, the  version  setting  is  fixed
                            until  you  change  it. If you don't specify this,
                            WAF uses the vendor's default  version,  and  then
                            keeps the version at the vendor's default when the
                            vendor updates the managed rule group settings.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group  whose
                            actions  are  set  to  Count  . When you exclude a
                            rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                            rule  action setting were Count . This is a useful
                            option for testing the rules in a rule group with-
                            out modifying how they handle your web traffic.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies  a  single rule in a rule group whose
                               action you want to override to Count . When you
                               exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                               would if the rule action setting were  Count  .
                               This  is  a useful option for testing the rules
                               in a rule group without modifying how they han-
                               dle your web traffic.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                        ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                            An optional  nested  statement  that  narrows  the
                            scope  of  the  web requests that are evaluated by
                            the managed rule group. Requests are  only  evalu-
                            ated   by   the  rule  group  if  they  match  the
                            scope-down statement. You  can  use  any  nestable
                            Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can
                            nest statements at any level, the same as you  can
                            for a rule statement.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this  is  ref-
                               ered to as a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 50 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type   of   operation  specified  in  the
                                     request.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The  maximum  length  of  the value
                                   before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode     BadBot     using     MIME
                                   base64-encoding  and  include the resulting
                                   value, QmFkQm90 , in the value  of  Search-
                                   String .
                                      If  you're  using  the CLI or one of the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The value that you want WAF to search  for.
                                   The  SDK  automatically  base64 encodes the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                             combination  of  a  backslash and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,      ja\vascript     for

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               Attackers sometimes insert malicious  SQL  code
                               into  web requests in an effort to extract data
                               from your  database.  To  allow  or  block  web
                               requests  that  appear to contain malicious SQL
                               code, create one or more  SQL  injection  match
                               conditions.  An  SQL  injection match condition
                               identifies the part of web  requests,  such  as
                               the  URI or the query string, that you want WAF
                               to inspect. Later in the process, when you cre-
                               ate  a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or
                               block requests that appear to contain malicious
                               SQL code.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to
                                                 include all  paths.  Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64

                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             process,  so  it  can   help   to
                                             uncover   ASCII  characters  that
                                             were encoded using  CSS  encoding
                                             that    wouldnt    typically   be
                                             encoded.  It's  also  useful   in

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of

                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                             MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash  from
                                             the  data  in the input. The com-

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is the
                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  defines  a cross-site
                               scripting (XSS) match search for WAF  to  apply
                               to  web  requests.  XSS attacks are those where
                               the attacker uses vulnerabilities in  a  benign
                               website   as  a  vehicle  to  inject  malicious
                               client-site scripts into other  legitimate  web
                               browsers.  The XSS match statement provides the
                               location in  requests  that  you  want  WAF  to
                               search  and  text transformations to use on the
                               search area before WAF searches  for  character
                               sequences  that  are  likely  to  be  malicious
                               strings.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web

                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations.  These  are  helpful  in
                                             reducing effectiveness of attack-

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following
                                            characters: / (

                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                          o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE         also
                                             replaces multiple spaces with one
                                             space.

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that  were  encoded using CSS 2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                             combination  of  a  backslash and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,      ja\vascript     for

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of
                                             hexadecimal   characters  into  a
                                             binary.

                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE   -    Replace

                                             unencoded             characters.
                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                          o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                          o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp;  with  a

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             NONE - Specify NONE if you  don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH  - Remove multiple
                                             slashes,  directory   self-refer-
                                             ences,  and directory back-refer-

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS -  Replace  each
                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.

                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             ,   but    with    support    for
                                             Microsoft-specific  %u  encoding.
                                             If the code is in the  full-width
                                             ASCII  code  range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all
                                             UTF-8 character sequences to Uni-
                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion, and minimizing  false-posi-
                                             tives   and  false-negatives  for

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement  that  compares  a  number  of
                               bytes  against the size of a request component,
                               using a comparison operator,  such  as  greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use a size constraint  statement  to  look  for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If  you  configure  WAF  to inspect the request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB).  If the request body for your web requests
                               never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size
                               constraint  condition  and  block requests that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If you choose URI for the value of Part of  the
                               request  to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI
                               counts as one character. For example,  the  URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as

                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a

                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to

                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte,  to  compare  to  the
                                   request part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can   help   to
                                             uncover   ASCII  characters  that
                                             were encoded using  CSS  encoding
                                             that    wouldnt    typically   be
                                             encoded.  It's  also  useful   in
                                             countering  evasion,  which  is a
                                             combination of  a  backslash  and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,     ja\vascript      for

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             the  data  in the input. The com-
                                             puted hash is  in  a  raw  binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE  - Specify NONE if you don't

                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is the
                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             occurrence of a  C-style  comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple consecutive  occurrences
                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An array of  two-character  country  codes,
                                   for  example,  [  "US",  "CN"  ] , from the
                                   alpha-2 country ISO codes of the  ISO  3166

                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching   the   rule  statement.  WAF
                                        applies  the  rule   action   to   the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule group with your rules,  then  provide  the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  You  can  only use a rule group
                               reference statement at the top level  inside  a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   entity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to  detect  web  requests
                               coming  from particular IP addresses or address
                               ranges. To use  this,  create  an   IPSet  that
                               specifies  the  addresses  you  want to detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each  IP  set  rule  statement references an IP
                               set. You create and maintain the  set  indepen-
                               dent  of your rules. This allows you to use the
                               single set in multiple rules. When  you  update
                               the  referenced  set, WAF automatically updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching   the   rule  statement.  WAF
                                        applies  the  rule   action   to   the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the  IP  address. The header can contain
                                      IP addresses of the original client  and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value  could  be  10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10  where  the first IP address
                                      identifies the original client  and  the
                                      rest  identify  proxies that the request
                                      went through.

                                      The options for  this  setting  are  the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address
                                        in the list of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.  This  is usually the client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST - Inspect the last IP address  in
                                        the   list  of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in  the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains more than 10 IP  addresses,  WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for  matches  with  regular  expres-
                               sions.  To  use this, create a  RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect,  then  use  the ARN of that set in this
                               statement. A web request  matches  the  pattern
                               set  rule  statement  if  the request component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate  a  regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each regex pattern set  rule  statement  refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain the set independent of  your  rules.  This
                               allows  you  to  use the single set in multiple
                               rules. When you update the referenced set,  WAF
                               automatically  updates all rules that reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)

                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)

                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of
                                             hexadecimal   characters  into  a
                                             binary.

                                             unencoded             characters.
                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             NONE - Specify NONE if you  don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A rate-based rule tracks the rate  of  requests
                               for  each  originating IP address, and triggers
                               the rule action when the rate exceeds  a  limit
                               that  you  specify on the number of requests in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a  temporary  block  on  requests  from  an  IP
                               address that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF tracks and manages web requests  separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use. For  example,  if  you  provide  the  same
                               rate-based  rule settings in two web ACLs, each
                               of the two rule statements represents  a  sepa-
                               rate  instance  of the rate-based rule and gets
                               its own tracking and management by WAF. If  you
                               define  a  rate-based rule inside a rule group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the rate-based rule that gets its own  tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional requests from the IP address  until  the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You   can  optionally  nest  another  statement
                               inside the rate-based statement, to narrow  the
                               scope  of  the  rule  so  that  it  only counts
                               requests that match the nested  statement.  For
                               example, based on recent requests that you have
                               seen from  an  attacker,  you  might  create  a
                               rate-based  rule  with a nested AND rule state-
                               ment that contains the following nested  state-
                               ments:

                               o An  IP  match  statement  with an IP set that
                                 specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit. For this  example,  the  rate  limit  is
                               1,000.  Requests  that  meet both of the condi-
                               tions in the statements  are  counted.  If  the
                               count  exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes,
                               the rule action triggers. Requests that do  not
                               meet  both  conditions  are not counted towards
                               the rate limit and are  not  affected  by  this
                               rule.

                               You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement inside
                               another statement, for example  inside  a  Not-
                               Statement  or  OrStatement  .  You can define a
                               RateBasedStatement inside a web ACL and  inside
                               a rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The  limit  on requests per 5-minute period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement  includes  a ScopeDownStatement ,
                                   this limit is applied only to the  requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header. If you use  this,  configure  the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                                   An optional nested statement  that  narrows
                                   the  scope  of  the  web  requests that are
                                   evaluated  by  the  rate-based   statement.
                                   Requests are only tracked by the rate-based
                                   statement  if  they  match  the  scope-down
                                   statement. You can use any nestable  State-
                                   ment in the scope-down statement,  and  you
                                   can  nest statements at any level, the same
                                   as you can for a rule statement.

                                   ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement that defines  a  string
                                      match  search  for  WAF  to apply to web
                                      requests. The byte match statement  pro-
                                      vides the bytes to search for, the loca-
                                      tion in requests that you  want  WAF  to
                                      search, and other settings. The bytes to
                                      search for are typically a  string  that
                                      corresponds  with  ASCII  characters. In
                                      the WAF console and the developer guide,
                                      this  is  refered  to  as a string match
                                      statement.

                                      SearchString -> (blob)
                                          A string value that you want WAF  to
                                          search for. WAF searches only in the
                                          part of web requests that you desig-
                                          nate for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                          . The maximum length of the value is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          Valid values depend on the component
                                          that you specify for  inspection  in
                                          FieldToMatch :

                                          o Method  : The HTTP method that you
                                            want WAF to search for. This indi-
                                            cates the type of operation speci-
                                            fied in the request.

                                          o UriPath : The value that you  want
                                            WAF to search for in the URI path,
                                            for example,  /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                            .

                                          If  SearchString includes alphabetic
                                          characters A-Z and  a-z,  note  that
                                          the value is case sensitive.
                                             If you're using the WAF API

                                          Specify  a base64-encoded version of
                                          the value. The maximum length of the
                                          value before you base64-encode it is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          For example, suppose  the  value  of
                                          Type is HEADER and the value of Data
                                          is  User-Agent  .  If  you  want  to
                                          search the User-Agent header for the
                                          value  BadBot  ,  you  base64-encode
                                          BadBot  using  MIME  base64-encoding
                                          and  include  the  resulting  value,
                                          QmFkQm90  ,  in the value of Search-
                                          String .
                                             If you're using the CLI or one of
                                             the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                          The  value  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                          search for.  The  SDK  automatically
                                          base64 encodes the value.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  query  argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-
                                             ers.   This  is  the  part  of  a
                                             request that contains  any  addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to your web server  as  the  HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a

                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)

                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)

                                   SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule statement that compares a number
                                      of bytes against the size of  a  request
                                      component,  using a comparison operator,
                                      such as greater than (>)  or  less  than
                                      (<).  For  example,  you  can use a size
                                      constraint statement to look  for  query
                                      strings  that are longer than 100 bytes.

                                      If you  configure  WAF  to  inspect  the
                                      request  body,  WAF  inspects  only  the
                                      first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the  request
                                      body for your web requests never exceeds
                                      8192 bytes, you can create a  size  con-
                                      straint  condition  and  block  requests
                                      that have a request  body  greater  than
                                      8192 bytes.

                                      If  you choose URI for the value of Part
                                      of the request to filter on,  the  slash
                                      (/)  in the URI counts as one character.
                                      For example, the URI /logo.jpg  is  nine
                                      characters long.

                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't

                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF) header, set this to  X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a valid  IP  address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                   RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement used to run  the  rules
                                      that  are  defined  in a  RuleGroup . To
                                      use this, create a rule group with  your
                                      rules,  then provide the ARN of the rule
                                      group in this statement.

                                      You cannot nest  a  RuleGroupReferenceS-
                                      tatement  , for example for use inside a
                                      NotStatement or OrStatement  .  You  can
                                      only  use  a rule group reference state-
                                      ment at the top level inside a web  ACL.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of
                                          the entity.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The rules  in  the  referenced  rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates  it exactly as it would if the
                                          rule action  setting  were  Count  .
                                          This  is a useful option for testing
                                          the rules in a  rule  group  without
                                          modifying  how  they handle your web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group  whose  action  you want to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it
                                             exactly as it would if  the  rule
                                             action  setting were Count . This
                                             is a useful  option  for  testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying how  they  handle  your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of  the rule whose
                                                 action you want  to  override
                                                 to Count .

                                   IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  detect web
                                      requests  coming  from   particular   IP
                                      addresses  or  address  ranges.  To  use
                                      this, create an   IPSet  that  specifies
                                      the  addresses  you want to detect, then
                                      use the ARN of that set in  this  state-
                                      ment.  To  create  an  IP set, see  Cre-
                                      ateIPSet .

                                      Each IP set rule statement references an
                                      IP  set. You create and maintain the set
                                      independent of your rules.  This  allows
                                      you  to  use  the single set in multiple
                                      rules. When you  update  the  referenced
                                      set, WAF automatically updates all rules
                                      that reference it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of
                                          the   IPSet that this statement ref-
                                          erences.

                                      IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                          The configuration for inspecting  IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify, instead  of  using  the  IP
                                          address  that's  reported by the web
                                          request origin.  Commonly,  this  is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF)  header, set this to X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                          Position -> (string)
                                             The  position  in  the  header to
                                             search for the  IP  address.  The
                                             header  can  contain IP addresses
                                             of the original client  and  also
                                             of   proxies.  For  example,  the
                                             header value could  be  10.1.1.1,
                                             127.0.0.0,  10.10.10.10 where the
                                             first IP address  identifies  the
                                             original   client  and  the  rest
                                             identify proxies that the request
                                             went through.

                                             The  options for this setting are
                                             the following:

                                             o FIRST - Inspect  the  first  IP
                                               address   in  the  list  of  IP
                                               addresses in the  header.  This
                                               is  usually the client's origi-
                                               nal IP.

                                             o LAST  -  Inspect  the  last  IP

                                   (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  search web
                                      request components for matches with reg-
                                      ular  expressions. To use this, create a
                                      RegexPatternSet   that   specifies   the
                                      expressions  that  you  want  to detect,
                                      then use the ARN of  that  set  in  this
                                      statement.  A  web  request  matches the
                                      pattern  set  rule  statement   if   the
                                      request  component  matches  any  of the
                                      patterns in the set. To create  a  regex
                                      pattern  set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet
                                      .

                                      Each regex pattern  set  rule  statement
                                      references a regex pattern set. You cre-
                                      ate and maintain the set independent  of
                                      your  rules.  This allows you to use the
                                      single set in multiple rules.  When  you
                                      update the referenced set, WAF automati-
                                      cally updates all rules  that  reference

                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the

                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)

                                                 JSON body.  The  options  are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -
                                                   Inspect the body  as  plain
                                                   text.  WAF applies the text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion   criteria   that  you
                                                   defined   for   the    JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web
                                                   request   as  matching  the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the
                                                 following  examples  as   two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.  If  you
                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                   RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rate-based  rule  tracks  the rate of
                                      requests   for   each   originating   IP
                                      address,  and  triggers  the rule action
                                      when the rate exceeds a limit  that  you
                                      specify on the number of requests in any
                                      5-minute time span. You can use this  to
                                      put  a  temporary block on requests from
                                      an IP address that is sending  excessive
                                      requests.

                                      WAF tracks and manages web requests sep-
                                      arately   for   each   instance   of   a
                                      rate-based  rule that you use. For exam-
                                      ple, if you provide the same  rate-based
                                      rule  settings  in two web ACLs, each of
                                      the two  rule  statements  represents  a
                                      separate instance of the rate-based rule
                                      and gets its own tracking and management
                                      by  WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                                      inside a rule group, and then  use  that
                                      rule  group in multiple places, each use
                                      creates  a  separate  instance  of   the
                                      rate-based rule that gets its own track-
                                      ing and management by WAF.

                                      When  the  rule  action  triggers,   WAF
                                      blocks  additional  requests from the IP
                                      address until  the  request  rate  falls
                                      below the limit.

                                      You  can  optionally nest another state-
                                      ment inside the rate-based statement, to
                                      narrow  the scope of the rule so that it
                                      only  counts  requests  that  match  the
                                      nested  statement. For example, based on
                                      recent requests that you have seen  from
                                      an   attacker,   you   might   create  a
                                      rate-based rule with a nested  AND  rule
                                      statement  that  contains  the following
                                      nested statements:

                                      o An IP match statement with an  IP  set
                                        that specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                      o A string match statement that searches
                                        in   the  User-Agent  header  for  the
                                        string BadBot.

                                      In this rate-based rule, you also define
                                      a rate limit. For this example, the rate
                                      limit is 1,000. Requests that meet  both
                                      of  the conditions in the statements are
                                      counted.  If  the  count  exceeds  1,000
                                      requests  per  five  minutes,  the  rule
                                      action triggers. Requests  that  do  not
                                      meet  both  conditions  are  not counted
                                      towards  the  rate  limit  and  are  not
                                      affected by this rule.

                                      You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement
                                      inside another  statement,  for  example
                                      inside  a  NotStatement or OrStatement .
                                      You  can  define  a   RateBasedStatement
                                      inside  a  web  ACL  and  inside  a rule
                                      group.

                                      Limit -> (long)
                                          The limit on requests  per  5-minute
                                          period  for  a single originating IP
                                          address. If the statement includes a
                                          ScopeDownStatement  ,  this limit is
                                          applied only to  the  requests  that
                                          match the statement.

                                      AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                          Setting that indicates how to aggre-
                                          gate the request counts. The options
                                          are the following:

                                          o IP  - Aggregate the request counts
                                            on the IP  address  from  the  web
                                            request origin.

                                          o FORWARDED_IP   -   Aggregate   the
                                            request counts  on  the  first  IP
                                            address  in an HTTP header. If you
                                            use  this,  configure   the   For-
                                            wardedIPConfig  ,  to  specify the
                                            header to use.

                                      ( ... recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig
                                      -> (structure)
                                          The  configuration for inspecting IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify,  instead  of  using  the IP
                                          address that's reported by  the  web
                                          request  origin.  Commonly,  this is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          This is required if AggregateKeyType
                                          is set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF)  header, set this to X-For-

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the

                                      A  logical rule statement used to negate
                                      the results of another  rule  statement.
                                      You  provide  one   Statement within the
                                      NotStatement .

                                   ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement used to run  the  rules
                                      that  are  defined  in  a  managed  rule
                                      group. To use this, provide  the  vendor
                                      name  and  the name of the rule group in
                                      this statement.  You  can  retrieve  the
                                      required  names  by  calling  ListAvail-
                                      ableManagedRuleGroups .

                                      You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupState-
                                      ment , for example for use inside a Not-
                                      Statement or OrStatement . It  can  only
                                      be  referenced  as a top-level statement
                                      within a rule.

                                      VendorName -> (string)
                                          The name of the managed  rule  group
                                          vendor. You use this, along with the
                                          rule group  name,  to  identify  the
                                          rule group.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the managed rule group.
                                          You use this, along with the  vendor
                                          name, to identify the rule group.

                                      Version -> (string)
                                          The  version  of  the  managed  rule
                                          group to use. If you  specify  this,
                                          the  version  setting is fixed until
                                          you change it. If you don't  specify
                                          this,  WAF uses the vendor's default
                                          version, and then keeps the  version
                                          at  the  vendor's  default  when the
                                          vendor  updates  the  managed   rule
                                          group settings.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The  rules  in  the  referenced rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates it exactly as it would if  the
                                          rule  action  setting  were  Count .
                                          This is a useful option for  testing
                                          the  rules  in  a rule group without
                                          modifying how they handle  your  web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group whose action  you  want  to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude a rule, WAF evaluates  it
                                             exactly  as  it would if the rule
                                             action setting were Count .  This
                                             is  a  useful  option for testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying  how  they  handle your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of  the  rule  whose
                                                 action  you  want to override
                                                 to Count .

                                   LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement that defines  a  string
                                      match  search  against  labels that have
                                      been added to the web request  by  rules
                                      that have already run in the web ACL.

                                      The  label  match statement provides the
                                      label or namespace string to search for.
                                      The label string can represent a part or
                                      all of the fully  qualified  label  name
                                      that  had been added to the web request.
                                      Fully qualified labels  have  a  prefix,
                                      optional namespaces, and label name. The
                                      prefix identifies the rule group or  web
                                      ACL  context  of the rule that added the
                                      label. If you do not provide  the  fully
                                      qualified   name  in  your  label  match
                                      string,  WAF  performs  the  search  for
                                      labels  that were added in the same con-
                                      text as the label match statement.

                                      Scope -> (string)
                                          Specify whether you  want  to  match
                                          using  the  label  name  or just the
                                          namespace.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          The string  to  match  against.  The
                                          setting you provide for this depends
                                          on the match statement's Scope  set-
                                          ting:

                                          o If  the  Scope  indicates  LABEL ,
                                            then   this   specification   must
                                            include  the  name and can include
                                            any number of preceding  namespace
                                            specifications  and  prefix  up to
                                            providing  the   fully   qualified
                                            label name.

                                          o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE ,
                                            then   this   specification    can
                                            include  any  number of contiguous
                                            namespace strings, and can include
                                            the  entire label namespace prefix
                                            from the rule  group  or  web  ACL
                                            where the label originates.

                                          Labels are case sensitive and compo-
                                          nents of a label must  be  separated
                                          by colon, for example NS1:NS2:name .

                                   RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule  statement  used  to  search  web
                                      request components for a match against a
                                      single regular expression.

                                      RegexString -> (string)
                                          The string representing the  regular
                                          expression.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule   statement.   WAF
                                        applies   the   rule   action  to  the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with  AND  logic.  You  provide
                               more  than  one  Statement within the AndState-
                               ment .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine with  AND  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   (structure)
                                      The processing guidance for  a   Rule  ,
                                      used  by  WAF to determine whether a web
                                      request matches the rule.

                                      ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  that  defines  a
                                          string match search for WAF to apply
                                          to  web  requests.  The  byte  match
                                          statement   provides  the  bytes  to
                                          search for, the location in requests
                                          that  you  want  WAF  to search, and
                                          other settings. The bytes to  search
                                          for are typically a string that cor-
                                          responds with ASCII  characters.  In

                                          SearchString -> (blob)
                                             A  string value that you want WAF
                                             to search for. WAF searches  only
                                             in  the part of web requests that
                                             you designate for  inspection  in
                                             FieldToMatch . The maximum length
                                             of the value is 50 bytes.

                                             Valid values depend on the compo-
                                             nent that you specify for inspec-
                                             tion in FieldToMatch :

                                             o Method : The HTTP  method  that
                                               you  want  WAF  to  search for.
                                               This  indicates  the  type   of
                                               operation   specified   in  the
                                               request.

                                             o UriPath : The  value  that  you
                                               want  WAF  to search for in the
                                               URI    path,    for    example,
                                               /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                             If  SearchString  includes alpha-
                                             betic  characters  A-Z  and  a-z,
                                             note  that the value is case sen-
                                             sitive.
                                                 If you're using the WAF API

                                             Specify a base64-encoded  version
                                             of  the value. The maximum length
                                             of   the   value    before    you
                                             base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                             For example, suppose the value of
                                             Type is HEADER and the  value  of
                                             Data  is User-Agent . If you want
                                             to search the  User-Agent  header
                                             for   the   value  BadBot  ,  you
                                             base64-encode BadBot  using  MIME
                                             base64-encoding  and  include the
                                             resulting value,  QmFkQm90  ,  in
                                             the value of SearchString .
                                                 If  you're  using  the CLI or
                                                 one of the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                                                 vices SDKs

                                             The  value  that  you want WAF to
                                             search for. The SDK automatically
                                             base64 encodes the value.

                                          FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                             The  part  of  a web request that
                                             you want WAF to inspect. For more

                                                 to  inspect,   for   example,
                                                 User-Agent  or Referer . This
                                                 setting isn't case sensitive.

                                                 Example JSON: "SingleHeader":

                                             Body -> (structure)
                                                 Inspect the request  body  as
                                                 plain  text. The request body
                                                 immediately    follows    the
                                                 request  headers. This is the

                                                 from a form.

                                                 Note that only the first 8 KB
                                                 (8192 bytes) of  the  request

                                          requests  that  appear  to   contain
                                          malicious  SQL  code,  create one or
                                          more SQL injection match conditions.
                                          An  SQL  injection  match  condition

                                      SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rule  statement  that  compares  a
                                          number  of bytes against the size of
                                          a request component, using a compar-
                                          ison  operator, such as greater than
                                          (>) or less than (<).  For  example,
                                          you can use a size constraint state-
                                          ment to look for query strings  that
                                          are longer than 100 bytes.

                                          If  you configure WAF to inspect the
                                          request body, WAF inspects only  the
                                          first  8192  bytes  (8  KB).  If the
                                          request body for your  web  requests
                                          never  exceeds  8192  bytes, you can
                                          create a size  constraint  condition
                                          and   block  requests  that  have  a
                                          request  body  greater   than   8192
                                          bytes.

                                          If  you  choose URI for the value of
                                          Part of the request  to  filter  on,
                                          the  slash  (/) in the URI counts as
                                          one character. For example, the  URI
                                          /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                                             The  configuration for inspecting
                                             IP addresses in  an  HTTP  header
                                             that   you  specify,  instead  of
                                             using  the  IP   address   that's
                                             reported  by the web request ori-
                                             gin. Commonly, this is the X-For-
                                             warded-For  (XFF) header, but you
                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             HeaderName -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the HTTP header
                                                 to use for  the  IP  address.
                                                 For   example,   to  use  the
                                                 X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                                 set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header

                                             FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                                 The match status to assign to
                                                 the   web   request   if  the

                                                 position.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the

                                                    request at all.

                                                 You can specify the following
                                                 fallback behaviors:

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                      RuleGroupReferenceStatement  ->  (struc-
                                      ture)
                                          A rule statement  used  to  run  the
                                          rules  that  are defined in a  Rule-
                                          Group . To use this, create  a  rule
                                          group  with your rules, then provide
                                          the ARN of the rule  group  in  this
                                          statement.

                                          You  cannot  nest  a RuleGroupRefer-
                                          enceStatement , for example for  use
                                          inside a NotStatement or OrStatement
                                          . You can only use a rule group ref-
                                          erence  statement  at  the top level
                                          inside a web ACL.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the entity.

                                          ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                             The  rules in the referenced rule
                                             group whose actions  are  set  to
                                             Count  . When you exclude a rule,
                                             WAF evaluates it  exactly  as  it
                                             would  if the rule action setting
                                             were Count .  This  is  a  useful
                                             option for testing the rules in a
                                             rule group without modifying  how
                                             they handle your web traffic.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies  a single rule in a
                                                 rule group whose  action  you
                                                 want  to  override to Count .
                                                 When you exclude a rule,  WAF
                                                 evaluates  it  exactly  as it
                                                 would if the rule action set-
                                                 ting  were  Count . This is a
                                                 useful option for testing the
                                                 rules in a rule group without
                                                 modifying  how  they   handle
                                                 your web traffic.

                                                 Name -> (string)
                                                    The name of the rule whose
                                                    action you want  to  over-
                                                    ride to Count .

                                      IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule statement used to detect web
                                          requests coming from  particular  IP
                                          addresses  or address ranges. To use
                                          this, create an  IPSet  that  speci-
                                          fies   the  addresses  you  want  to
                                          detect, then use the ARN of that set
                                          in  this  statement. To create an IP
                                          set, see  CreateIPSet .

                                          Each IP set  rule  statement  refer-
                                          ences  an  IP  set.  You  create and
                                          maintain the set independent of your
                                          rules.  This  allows  you to use the
                                          single set in multiple  rules.  When
                                          you  update  the referenced set, WAF
                                          automatically updates all rules that
                                          reference it.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the  IPSet  that  this  statement
                                             references.

                                             reported by the web request  ori-
                                             gin. Commonly, this is the X-For-

                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't

                                                 The name of the  HTTP  header
                                                 to  use  for  the IP address.
                                                 For  example,  to   use   the

                                                 set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                                                    isn't   present   in   the
                                                    request, WAF doesn't apply
                                                    the  rule   to   the   web
                                                    request at all.

                                                 You can specify the following
                                                 fallback behaviors:

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web
                                                   request   as  matching  the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                             Position -> (string)
                                                 The position in the header to
                                                 search  for  the  IP address.
                                                 The  header  can  contain  IP
                                                 addresses   of  the  original
                                                 client and also  of  proxies.
                                                 For example, the header value
                                                 could be 10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0,
                                                 10.10.10.10  where  the first
                                                 IP  address  identifies   the
                                                 original  client and the rest
                                                 identify  proxies  that   the
                                                 request went through.

                                                 The  options for this setting
                                                 are the following:

                                                 o FIRST - Inspect  the  first
                                                   IP  address  in the list of
                                                   IP addresses in the header.
                                                   This    is    usually   the
                                                   client's original IP.

                                                 o LAST - Inspect the last  IP
                                                   address  in  the list of IP
                                                   addresses in the header.

                                                 o ANY  -   Inspect   all   IP
                                                   addresses in the header for
                                                   a match. If the header con-
                                                   tains   more   than  10  IP
                                                   addresses, WAF inspects the
                                                   last 10.

                                      RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement     ->
                                      (structure)
                                          A rule statement used to search  web
                                          request  components for matches with
                                          regular expressions.  To  use  this,
                                          create a  RegexPatternSet that spec-
                                          ifies the expressions that you  want
                                          to  detect, then use the ARN of that
                                          set in this statement. A web request
                                          matches  the pattern set rule state-
                                          ment  if   the   request   component
                                          matches  any  of the patterns in the
                                          set. To create a regex pattern  set,
                                          see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                          Each  regex  pattern set rule state-
                                          ment references a regex pattern set.
                                          You  create  and  maintain  the  set
                                          independent  of  your  rules.   This
                                          allows  you to use the single set in
                                          multiple rules. When you update  the
                                          referenced  set,  WAF  automatically
                                          updates all rules that reference it.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the   RegexPatternSet  that  this
                                             statement references.

                                          FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                             The  part  of  a web request that
                                             you want WAF to inspect. For more
                                             information,  see  FieldToMatch .

                                             SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                                 Inspect a single header. Pro-

                                                 to  inspect,   for   example,
                                                 User-Agent  or Referer . This
                                                 setting isn't case sensitive.

                                                 Inspect the request URI path.
                                                 This is the  part  of  a  web

                                             QueryString -> (structure)
                                                 Inspect   the  query  string.
                                                 This is the  part  of  a  URL

                                          block on requests from an IP address
                                          that  is sending excessive requests.

                                          WAF tracks and manages web  requests
                                          separately  for  each  instance of a
                                          rate-based rule that  you  use.  For
                                          example,  if  you  provide  the same
                                          rate-based rule settings in two  web
                                          ACLs,  each  of  the two rule state-
                                          ments represents a separate instance
                                          of  the rate-based rule and gets its
                                          own tracking and management by  WAF.
                                          If  you  define  a  rate-based  rule
                                          inside a rule group,  and  then  use
                                          that  rule group in multiple places,
                                          each use creates a separate instance
                                          of the rate-based rule that gets its
                                          own tracking and management by  WAF.

                                          When  the  rule action triggers, WAF
                                          blocks additional requests from  the
                                          IP  address  until  the request rate
                                          falls below the limit.

                                          You  can  optionally  nest   another
                                          statement   inside   the  rate-based
                                          statement, to narrow  the  scope  of
                                          the  rule  so  that  it  only counts
                                          requests  that  match   the   nested
                                          statement.  For  example,  based  on
                                          recent requests that you  have  seen
                                          from an attacker, you might create a
                                          rate-based rule with  a  nested  AND
                                          rule  statement  that  contains  the
                                          following nested statements:

                                          o An IP match statement with  an  IP
                                            set  that  specified  the  address
                                            192.0.2.44.

                                          o A  string  match  statement   that
                                            searches  in the User-Agent header
                                            for the string BadBot.

                                          In this rate-based  rule,  you  also
                                          define  a rate limit. For this exam-
                                          ple,  the  rate  limit   is   1,000.
                                          Requests  that meet both of the con-
                                          ditions  in   the   statements   are
                                          counted.  If the count exceeds 1,000
                                          requests per five minutes, the  rule
                                          action  triggers.  Requests  that do
                                          not meet  both  conditions  are  not
                                          counted  towards  the rate limit and
                                          are not affected by this rule.

                                          You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement
                                          inside  another statement, for exam-
                                          ple   inside   a   NotStatement   or
                                          OrStatement . You can define a Rate-
                                          BasedStatement inside a web ACL  and
                                          inside a rule group.

                                          Limit -> (long)
                                             The   limit   on   requests   per
                                             5-minute  period  for  a   single
                                             originating  IP  address.  If the
                                             statement includes  a  ScopeDown-
                                             Statement , this limit is applied
                                             only to the requests  that  match
                                             the statement.

                                          AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                             Setting  that  indicates  how  to
                                             aggregate the request counts. The
                                             options are the following:

                                             o IP   -  Aggregate  the  request
                                               counts on the IP  address  from
                                               the web request origin.

                                             o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the
                                               request counts on the first  IP
                                               address  in  an HTTP header. If
                                               you  use  this,  configure  the
                                               ForwardedIPConfig  , to specify
                                               the header to use.

                                          fig -> (structure)
                                             The  configuration for inspecting
                                             IP addresses in  an  HTTP  header
                                             that   you  specify,  instead  of
                                             using  the  IP   address   that's
                                             reported  by the web request ori-
                                             gin. Commonly, this is the X-For-
                                             warded-For  (XFF) header, but you
                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             This is required if AggregateKey-
                                             Type is set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                             HeaderName -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  HTTP  header
                                                 to  use  for  the IP address.
                                                 For  example,  to   use   the
                                                 X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                                 set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the
                                                    request, WAF doesn't apply
                                                    the  rule   to   the   web
                                                    request at all.

                                             FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                                 The match status to assign to
                                                 the  web   request   if   the
                                                 request  doesn't have a valid
                                                 IP address in  the  specified
                                                 position.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the
                                                    request, WAF doesn't apply
                                                    the  rule   to   the   web
                                                    request at all.

                                                 You can specify the following
                                                 fallback behaviors:

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web
                                                   request   as  matching  the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the

                                          Statements -> (list)
                                             The statements  to  combine  with
                                             AND logic. You can use any state-
                                             ments that can be nested.

                                      OrStatement -> (structure)
                                          A logical  rule  statement  used  to
                                          combine  other  rule statements with
                                          OR logic. You provide more than  one

                                          negate the results of  another  rule
                                          statement.  You  provide one  State-
                                          ment within the NotStatement .

                                      ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  used  to run the
                                          rules that are defined in a  managed
                                          rule group. To use this, provide the
                                          vendor name and the name of the rule
                                          group  in  this  statement.  You can
                                          retrieve the required names by call-
                                          ing   ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups
                                          .

                                          You cannot nest a  ManagedRuleGroup-
                                          Statement  ,  for  example  for  use
                                          inside a NotStatement or OrStatement
                                          .  It  can  only  be referenced as a
                                          top-level statement within a rule.

                                          VendorName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the  managed  rule
                                             group vendor. You use this, along
                                             with  the  rule  group  name,  to
                                             identify the rule group.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the  managed  rule
                                             group. You use this,  along  with
                                             the  vendor name, to identify the
                                             rule group.

                                          Version -> (string)
                                             The version of the  managed  rule
                                             group  to  use.  If  you  specify
                                             this,  the  version  setting   is
                                             fixed until you change it. If you
                                             don't specify this, WAF uses  the
                                             vendor's   default  version,  and
                                             then keeps  the  version  at  the
                                             vendor's  default when the vendor
                                             updates the  managed  rule  group
                                             settings.

                                          ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                             The  rules in the referenced rule
                                             group whose actions  are  set  to
                                             Count  . When you exclude a rule,
                                             WAF evaluates it  exactly  as  it
                                             would  if the rule action setting
                                             were Count .  This  is  a  useful
                                             option for testing the rules in a
                                             rule group without modifying  how
                                             they handle your web traffic.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies  a single rule in a
                                                 rule group whose  action  you
                                                 want  to  override to Count .
                                                 When you exclude a rule,  WAF
                                                 evaluates  it  exactly  as it
                                                 would if the rule action set-
                                                 ting  were  Count . This is a
                                                 useful option for testing the
                                                 rules in a rule group without
                                                 modifying  how  they   handle
                                                 your web traffic.

                                                 Name -> (string)

                                      LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  that  defines  a
                                          string match search  against  labels
                                          that  have  been  added  to  the web
                                          request by rules that  have  already
                                          run in the web ACL.

                                          The  label  match statement provides
                                          the label  or  namespace  string  to
                                          search  for.  The  label  string can
                                          represent a part or all of the fully
                                          qualified  label  name that had been
                                          added  to  the  web  request.  Fully
                                          qualified   labels  have  a  prefix,
                                          optional namespaces, and label name.
                                          The prefix identifies the rule group
                                          or web ACL context of the rule  that
                                          added  the label. If you do not pro-
                                          vide the  fully  qualified  name  in
                                          your  label  match  string, WAF per-
                                          forms the  search  for  labels  that
                                          were  added  in  the same context as
                                          the label match statement.

                                          Scope -> (string)
                                             Specify whether you want to match
                                             using  the label name or just the
                                             namespace.

                                          Key -> (string)
                                             The string to match against.  The
                                             setting   you  provide  for  this
                                             depends on the match  statement's
                                             Scope setting:

                                             o If  the Scope indicates LABEL ,
                                               then  this  specification  must
                                               include   the   name   and  can
                                               include any number of preceding
                                               namespace   specifications  and
                                               prefix  up  to  providing   the
                                               fully qualified label name.

                                             o If  the  Scope indicates NAMES-
                                               PACE , then this  specification
                                               can  include any number of con-
                                               tiguous namespace strings,  and
                                               can  include  the  entire label
                                               namespace prefix from the  rule
                                               group  or  web  ACL  where  the
                                               label originates.

                                             Labels  are  case  sensitive  and
                                             components  of  a  label  must be
                                             separated by colon,  for  example
                                             NS1:NS2:name .

                                      RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule statement used to search web

                                          FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                             The  part  of  a web request that
                                             you want WAF to inspect. For more

                                             AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                                 Inspect all query  arguments.

                                             UriPath -> (structure)
                                                 Inspect the request URI path.
                                                 This is the  part  of  a  web
                                                 request   that  identifies  a

                                             Body -> (structure)
                                                 Inspect the request  body  as
                                                 plain  text. The request body
                                                 immediately    follows    the
                                                 request  headers. This is the

                                                 from a form.

                                                 Note that only the first 8 KB

                                             Method -> (structure)
                                                 Inspect  the HTTP method. The
                                                 method indicates the type  of
                                                 operation that the request is
                                                 asking the origin to perform.

                                      ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  that  defines  a
                                          string match search for WAF to apply
                                          to  web  requests.  The  byte  match
                                          statement  provides  the  bytes   to
                                          search for, the location in requests

                                          other  settings. The bytes to search
                                          for are typically a string that cor-
                                          responds  with  ASCII characters. In

                                          SearchString -> (blob)
                                             A string value that you want  WAF
                                             to  search for. WAF searches only
                                             in the part of web requests  that
                                             you  designate  for inspection in
                                             FieldToMatch . The maximum length
                                             of the value is 50 bytes.

                                             Valid values depend on the compo-
                                             nent that you specify for inspec-
                                             tion in FieldToMatch :

                                               you want  WAF  to  search  for.
                                               This   indicates  the  type  of
                                               operation  specified   in   the
                                               request.

                                             o UriPath  :  The  value that you
                                               want WAF to search for  in  the
                                               URI    path,    for    example,
                                               /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                             If SearchString  includes  alpha-
                                             betic  characters  A-Z  and  a-z,
                                             note that the value is case  sen-
                                             sitive.
                                                 If you're using the WAF API

                                             Specify  a base64-encoded version
                                             of the value. The maximum  length
                                             of    the    value   before   you
                                             base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                             For example, suppose the value of
                                             Type  is  HEADER and the value of
                                             Data is User-Agent . If you  want
                                             to  search  the User-Agent header
                                             for  the  value  BadBot   ,   you
                                             base64-encode  BadBot  using MIME
                                             base64-encoding and  include  the
                                             resulting  value,  QmFkQm90  , in
                                             the value of SearchString .

                                                        and the higher byte is
                                                        zeroed.

                                      SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  that  compares a
                                          number of bytes against the size  of
                                          a request component, using a compar-
                                          ison operator, such as greater  than
                                          (>)  or  less than (<). For example,
                                          you can use a size constraint state-
                                          ment  to look for query strings that
                                          are longer than 100 bytes.

                                          If you configure WAF to inspect  the
                                          request  body, WAF inspects only the
                                          first 8192  bytes  (8  KB).  If  the
                                          request  body  for your web requests
                                          never exceeds 8192  bytes,  you  can
                                          create  a  size constraint condition
                                          and  block  requests  that  have   a
                                          request   body   greater  than  8192
                                          bytes.

                                          If you choose URI for the  value  of
                                          Part  of  the  request to filter on,
                                          the slash (/) in the URI  counts  as
                                          one  character. For example, the URI
                                          /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                                          ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                             The configuration for  inspecting
                                             IP  addresses  in  an HTTP header
                                             that  you  specify,  instead   of
                                             using   the   IP  address  that's

                                             gin. Commonly, this is the X-For-
                                             warded-For (XFF) header, but  you
                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF

                                             HeaderName -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  HTTP  header
                                                 to  use  for  the IP address.
                                                 For  example,  to   use   the
                                                 X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,

                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web

                                      ture)
                                          A  rule  statement  used  to run the
                                          rules that are defined in  a   Rule-
                                          Group  .  To use this, create a rule
                                          group with your rules, then  provide
                                          the  ARN  of  the rule group in this
                                          statement.

                                          You cannot  nest  a  RuleGroupRefer-

                                          . You can only use a rule group ref-
                                          erence statement at  the  top  level
                                          inside a web ACL.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the entity.

                                          ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                             The rules in the referenced  rule
                                             group  whose  actions  are set to
                                             Count . When you exclude a  rule,
                                             WAF  evaluates  it  exactly as it
                                             would if the rule action  setting
                                             were  Count  .  This  is a useful
                                             option for testing the rules in a
                                             rule  group without modifying how
                                             they handle your web traffic.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies a single rule in  a

                                                 want to override to  Count  .
                                                 When  you exclude a rule, WAF
                                                 evaluates it  exactly  as  it
                                                 would if the rule action set-

                                                 Name -> (string)
                                                    The name of the rule whose

                                      IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rule statement used to detect  web
                                          requests  coming  from particular IP
                                          addresses or address ranges. To  use
                                          this,  create  an  IPSet that speci-
                                          fies  the  addresses  you  want   to
                                          detect, then use the ARN of that set
                                          in this statement. To create  an  IP
                                          set, see  CreateIPSet .

                                          Each  IP  set  rule statement refer-
                                          ences an  IP  set.  You  create  and
                                          maintain the set independent of your
                                          rules. This allows you  to  use  the
                                          single  set  in multiple rules. When
                                          you update the referenced  set,  WAF
                                          automatically updates all rules that
                                          reference it.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the   IPSet  that  this statement

                                          ture)
                                             The  configuration for inspecting
                                             IP addresses in  an  HTTP  header
                                             that   you  specify,  instead  of
                                             using  the  IP   address   that's
                                             reported  by the web request ori-
                                             gin. Commonly, this is the X-For-
                                             warded-For  (XFF) header, but you
                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             HeaderName -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the HTTP header
                                                 to use for  the  IP  address.
                                                 For   example,   to  use  the
                                                 X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                                 set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header

                                             FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                                 The match status to assign to
                                                 the   web   request   if  the
                                                 request doesn't have a  valid
                                                 IP  address  in the specified
                                                 position.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the
                                                    request, WAF doesn't apply
                                                    the   rule   to   the  web

                                                 You can specify the following
                                                 fallback behaviors:

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                             Position -> (string)
                                                 The position in the header to
                                                 search for  the  IP  address.
                                                 The  header  can  contain  IP
                                                 addresses  of  the   original
                                                 client  and  also of proxies.
                                                 For example, the header value
                                                 could be 10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0,
                                                 10.10.10.10 where  the  first
                                                 IP   address  identifies  the
                                                 original client and the  rest
                                                 identify   proxies  that  the
                                                 request went through.

                                                 The options for this  setting
                                                 are the following:

                                                 o FIRST  -  Inspect the first
                                                   IP address in the  list  of
                                                   IP addresses in the header.
                                                   This   is    usually    the
                                                   client's original IP.

                                                 o LAST  - Inspect the last IP
                                                   address in the list  of  IP
                                                   addresses in the header.

                                                 o ANY   -   Inspect   all  IP
                                                   addresses in the header for
                                                   a match. If the header con-
                                                   tains  more  than   10   IP
                                                   addresses, WAF inspects the
                                                   last 10.

                                      (structure)
                                          A  rule statement used to search web
                                          request components for matches  with
                                          regular  expressions.  To  use this,
                                          create a  RegexPatternSet that spec-
                                          ifies  the expressions that you want
                                          to detect, then use the ARN of  that
                                          set in this statement. A web request
                                          matches the pattern set rule  state-
                                          ment   if   the   request  component
                                          matches any of the patterns  in  the
                                          set.  To create a regex pattern set,
                                          see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                          Each regex pattern set  rule  state-
                                          ment references a regex pattern set.
                                          You  create  and  maintain  the  set
                                          independent   of  your  rules.  This
                                          allows you to use the single set  in
                                          multiple  rules. When you update the
                                          referenced  set,  WAF  automatically
                                          updates all rules that reference it.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the   RegexPatternSet  that  this
                                             statement references.

                                          FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                             The part of a  web  request  that
                                             you want WAF to inspect. For more

                                      RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rate-based rule tracks the rate of
                                          requests  for  each  originating  IP
                                          address,  and  triggers   the   rule
                                          action when the rate exceeds a limit
                                          that you specify on  the  number  of
                                          requests  in any 5-minute time span.
                                          You can use this to put a  temporary
                                          block on requests from an IP address
                                          that is sending excessive  requests.

                                          WAF  tracks and manages web requests
                                          separately for each  instance  of  a
                                          rate-based  rule  that  you use. For
                                          example, if  you  provide  the  same
                                          rate-based  rule settings in two web
                                          ACLs, each of the  two  rule  state-
                                          ments represents a separate instance
                                          of the rate-based rule and gets  its
                                          own  tracking and management by WAF.
                                          If  you  define  a  rate-based  rule
                                          inside  a  rule  group, and then use
                                          that rule group in multiple  places,
                                          each use creates a separate instance
                                          of the rate-based rule that gets its
                                          own  tracking and management by WAF.

                                          When the rule action  triggers,  WAF
                                          blocks  additional requests from the
                                          IP address until  the  request  rate
                                          falls below the limit.

                                          You   can  optionally  nest  another
                                          statement  inside   the   rate-based
                                          statement,  to  narrow  the scope of
                                          the rule  so  that  it  only  counts
                                          requests   that   match  the  nested
                                          statement.  For  example,  based  on
                                          recent  requests  that you have seen
                                          from an attacker, you might create a
                                          rate-based  rule  with  a nested AND
                                          rule  statement  that  contains  the
                                          following nested statements:

                                          o An  IP  match statement with an IP
                                            set  that  specified  the  address
                                            192.0.2.44.

                                          o A   string  match  statement  that
                                            searches in the User-Agent  header
                                            for the string BadBot.

                                          In  this  rate-based  rule, you also
                                          define a rate limit. For this  exam-
                                          ple,   the   rate  limit  is  1,000.
                                          Requests that meet both of the  con-
                                          ditions   in   the   statements  are
                                          counted. If the count exceeds  1,000
                                          requests  per five minutes, the rule
                                          action triggers.  Requests  that  do
                                          not  meet  both  conditions  are not
                                          counted towards the rate  limit  and
                                          are not affected by this rule.

                                          You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement
                                          inside another statement, for  exam-
                                          ple   inside   a   NotStatement   or
                                          OrStatement . You can define a Rate-
                                          BasedStatement  inside a web ACL and
                                          inside a rule group.

                                          Limit -> (long)
                                             The   limit   on   requests   per
                                             5-minute   period  for  a  single
                                             originating IP  address.  If  the
                                             statement  includes  a ScopeDown-
                                             Statement , this limit is applied
                                             only  to  the requests that match
                                             the statement.

                                          AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                             Setting  that  indicates  how  to
                                             aggregate the request counts. The
                                             options are the following:

                                             o IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                               counts  on  the IP address from
                                               the web request origin.

                                             o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the
                                               request  counts on the first IP
                                               address in an HTTP  header.  If
                                               you  use  this,  configure  the
                                               ForwardedIPConfig , to  specify
                                               the header to use.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             This is required if AggregateKey-
                                             Type is set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                             HeaderName -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the HTTP header
                                                 to use for  the  IP  address.
                                                 For   example,   to  use  the
                                                 X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                                 set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the

                                             FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                                 The match status to assign to
                                                 the   web   request   if  the
                                                 request doesn't have a  valid

                                                 position.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the

                                                 You can specify the following
                                                 fallback behaviors:

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web

                                                   rule statement.

                                      AndStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  logical  rule  statement  used to
                                          combine other rule  statements  with
                                          AND logic. You provide more than one
                                          Statement within the AndStatement  .

                                          Statements -> (list)
                                             The  statements  to  combine with
                                             AND logic. You can use any state-
                                             ments that can be nested.

                                             ( ... recursive ... )

                                      OrStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  logical  rule  statement  used to
                                          combine other rule  statements  with
                                          OR  logic. You provide more than one
                                          Statement within the OrStatement .

                                          Statements -> (list)
                                             The statements to combine with OR
                                             logic. You can use any statements
                                             that can be nested.

                                             ( ... recursive ... )

                                      NotStatement -> (structure)
                                          A logical  rule  statement  used  to
                                          negate  the  results of another rule
                                          statement. You provide  one   State-
                                          ment within the NotStatement .

                                          ( ... recursive ... )

                                      ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rule statement  used  to  run  the
                                          rules  that are defined in a managed
                                          rule group. To use this, provide the
                                          vendor name and the name of the rule
                                          group in  this  statement.  You  can
                                          retrieve the required names by call-
                                          ing   ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups
                                          .

                                          You  cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroup-
                                          Statement  ,  for  example  for  use
                                          inside a NotStatement or OrStatement
                                          . It can only  be  referenced  as  a
                                          top-level statement within a rule.

                                          VendorName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the  managed  rule
                                             group vendor. You use this, along
                                             with  the  rule  group  name,  to
                                             identify the rule group.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the  managed  rule
                                             group.  You  use this, along with
                                             the vendor name, to identify  the
                                             rule group.

                                          Version -> (string)
                                             The  version  of the managed rule
                                             group  to  use.  If  you  specify
                                             this,   the  version  setting  is
                                             fixed until you change it. If you
                                             don't  specify this, WAF uses the
                                             vendor's  default  version,   and
                                             then  keeps  the  version  at the
                                             vendor's default when the  vendor
                                             updates  the  managed  rule group
                                             settings.

                                          ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                             The rules in the referenced  rule
                                             group  whose  actions  are set to
                                             Count . When you exclude a  rule,
                                             WAF  evaluates  it  exactly as it
                                             would if the rule action  setting
                                             were  Count  .  This  is a useful
                                             option for testing the rules in a
                                             rule  group without modifying how
                                             they handle your web traffic.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies a single rule in  a
                                                 rule  group  whose action you
                                                 want to override to  Count  .
                                                 When  you exclude a rule, WAF
                                                 evaluates it  exactly  as  it
                                                 would if the rule action set-
                                                 ting were Count . This  is  a
                                                 useful option for testing the
                                                 rules in a rule group without
                                                 modifying   how  they  handle
                                                 your web traffic.

                                                 Name -> (string)
                                                    The name of the rule whose
                                                    action  you  want to over-
                                                    ride to Count .

                                      LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  that  defines  a
                                          string  match  search against labels
                                          that have  been  added  to  the  web
                                          request  by  rules that have already
                                          run in the web ACL.

                                          The label match  statement  provides
                                          the  label  or  namespace  string to
                                          search for.  The  label  string  can
                                          represent a part or all of the fully
                                          qualified label name that  had  been
                                          added  to  the  web  request.  Fully
                                          qualified  labels  have  a   prefix,
                                          optional namespaces, and label name.
                                          The prefix identifies the rule group
                                          or  web ACL context of the rule that
                                          added the label. If you do not  pro-
                                          vide  the  fully  qualified  name in

                                          were added in the  same  context  as
                                          the label match statement.

                                          Scope -> (string)
                                             Specify whether you want to match
                                             using the label name or just  the
                                             namespace.

                                          Key -> (string)
                                             The  string to match against. The
                                             setting  you  provide  for   this
                                             depends  on the match statement's
                                             Scope setting:

                                             o If the Scope indicates LABEL  ,
                                               then  this  specification  must
                                               include  the   name   and   can
                                               include any number of preceding
                                               namespace  specifications   and

                                               PACE  , then this specification
                                               can include any number of  con-
                                               tiguous  namespace strings, and
                                               can include  the  entire  label
                                               namespace  prefix from the rule
                                               group  or  web  ACL  where  the
                                               label originates.

                                             Labels  are  case  sensitive  and
                                             components of  a  label  must  be
                                             separated  by  colon, for example
                                             NS1:NS2:name .

                                      corresponds with  ASCII  characters.  In

                                      SearchString -> (blob)
                                          A  string value that you want WAF to
                                          search for. WAF searches only in the
                                          part of web requests that you desig-
                                          nate for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                          . The maximum length of the value is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          Valid values depend on the component
                                          that  you  specify for inspection in
                                          FieldToMatch :

                                          o Method : The HTTP method that  you
                                            want WAF to search for. This indi-
                                            cates the type of operation speci-
                                            fied in the request.

                                          o UriPath  : The value that you want
                                            WAF to search for in the URI path,
                                            for  example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                            .

                                          If SearchString includes  alphabetic
                                          characters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that
                                          the value is case sensitive.
                                             If you're using the WAF API

                                          Specify a base64-encoded version  of
                                          the value. The maximum length of the
                                          value before you base64-encode it is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          For  example,  suppose  the value of

                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-

                                                        Instead,  use  the All

                                                 What  WAF  should  do  if  it
                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -
                                                   Inspect  the  body as plain
                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                                   SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      Attackers sometimes insert malicious SQL
                                      code  into  web requests in an effort to
                                      extract  data  from  your  database.  To
                                      allow  or block web requests that appear
                                      to contain malicious  SQL  code,  create
                                      one  or  more SQL injection match condi-
                                      tions. An SQL injection match  condition
                                      identifies  the  part  of  web requests,
                                      such as the URI  or  the  query  string,
                                      that  you  want WAF to inspect. Later in

                                      you  specify  whether  to allow or block
                                      requests that appear  to  contain  mali-

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {

                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-

                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire contents of  web  requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                                    not both.

                                                 IncludedPaths -> (list)

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON body.  The  options  are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -

                                                   text.  WAF applies the text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion   criteria   that  you
                                                   defined   for   the    JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web
                                                   request   as  matching  the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the
                                                 following  examples  as   two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.  If  you
                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                             Text  transformations   eliminate
                                             some  of  the  unusual formatting

                                      attacks are  those  where  the  attacker

                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)

                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -

                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON

                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                                   SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement that compares a  number
                                      of  bytes  against the size of a request
                                      component, using a comparison  operator,
                                      such  as  greater  than (>) or less than
                                      (<). For example, you  can  use  a  size
                                      constraint  statement  to look for query
                                      strings that are longer than 100  bytes.

                                      If  you  configure  WAF  to  inspect the
                                      request  body,  WAF  inspects  only  the
                                      first  8192 bytes (8 KB). If the request
                                      body for your web requests never exceeds
                                      8192  bytes,  you can create a size con-
                                      straint  condition  and  block  requests
                                      that  have  a  request body greater than
                                      8192 bytes.

                                      If you choose URI for the value of  Part
                                      of  the  request to filter on, the slash
                                      (/) in the URI counts as one  character.
                                      For  example,  the URI /logo.jpg is nine
                                      characters long.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-
                                             ers.  This  is  the  part  of   a
                                             request  that  contains any addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to  your  web  server as the HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body

                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body of the web request, such  as
                                             ByteMatchStatement  or  RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that

                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect   the  HTTP  method.  The
                                             method  indicates  the  type   of

                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.
                                             The request body immediately fol-
                                             lows the request headers. This is
                                             the  part  of a request that con-
                                             tains any  additional  data  that
                                             you  want  to  send  to  your web

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -

                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                      ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                          The operator to use to  compare  the
                                          request part to the size setting.

                                      Size -> (long)
                                          The size, in byte, to compare to the
                                          request part, after any  transforma-
                                          tions.

                                      TextTransformations -> (list)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.  If  you
                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                          (structure)
                                             Text  transformations   eliminate

                                      ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                          The configuration for inspecting  IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify, instead  of  using  the  IP
                                          address  that's  reported by the web
                                          request origin.  Commonly,  this  is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For

                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                   RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement used to run the rules
                                      that are defined in a   RuleGroup  .  To
                                      use  this, create a rule group with your
                                      rules, then provide the ARN of the  rule
                                      group in this statement.

                                      You  cannot  nest a RuleGroupReferenceS-
                                      tatement , for example for use inside  a
                                      NotStatement  or  OrStatement  . You can
                                      only use a rule group  reference  state-
                                      ment  at the top level inside a web ACL.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of
                                          the entity.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The  rules  in  the  referenced rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates it exactly as it would if  the
                                          rule  action  setting  were  Count .
                                          This is a useful option for  testing
                                          the  rules  in  a rule group without
                                          modifying how they handle  your  web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group whose action  you  want  to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude a rule, WAF evaluates  it
                                             exactly  as  it would if the rule
                                             action setting were Count .  This
                                             is  a  useful  option for testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying  how  they  handle your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of  the  rule  whose
                                                 action  you  want to override
                                                 to Count .

                                   IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule  statement  used  to  detect  web
                                      requests   coming   from  particular  IP
                                      addresses  or  address  ranges.  To  use
                                      this,  create  an   IPSet that specifies
                                      the addresses you want to  detect,  then
                                      use  the  ARN of that set in this state-
                                      ment. To create an  IP  set,  see   Cre-
                                      ateIPSet .

                                      Each IP set rule statement references an
                                      IP set. You create and maintain the  set
                                      independent  of  your rules. This allows
                                      you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                                      rules.  When  you  update the referenced
                                      set, WAF automatically updates all rules
                                      that reference it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of
                                          the  IPSet that this statement  ref-
                                          erences.

                                      IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                          The  configuration for inspecting IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify,  instead  of  using  the IP
                                          address that's reported by  the  web
                                          request  origin.  Commonly,  this is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the HTTP header to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF) header, set this to  X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a valid  IP  address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                          Position -> (string)
                                             The position  in  the  header  to
                                             search  for  the  IP address. The
                                             header can contain  IP  addresses
                                             of  the  original client and also
                                             of  proxies.  For  example,   the
                                             header  value  could be 10.1.1.1,
                                             127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10 where  the
                                             first  IP  address identifies the
                                             original  client  and  the   rest
                                             identify proxies that the request
                                             went through.

                                             The options for this setting  are
                                             the following:

                                             o FIRST  -  Inspect  the first IP
                                               address  in  the  list  of   IP
                                               addresses  in  the header. This
                                               is usually the client's  origi-
                                               nal IP.

                                             o LAST  -  Inspect  the  last  IP
                                               address  in  the  list  of   IP
                                               addresses in the header.

                                             o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses
                                               in the header for a  match.  If
                                               the  header  contains more than
                                               10 IP addresses,  WAF  inspects
                                               the last 10.

                                   RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement        ->
                                   (structure)
                                      A rule  statement  used  to  search  web
                                      request components for matches with reg-
                                      ular expressions. To use this, create  a
                                      RegexPatternSet   that   specifies   the
                                      expressions that  you  want  to  detect,
                                      then  use  the  ARN  of that set in this
                                      statement. A  web  request  matches  the
                                      pattern   set   rule  statement  if  the
                                      request component  matches  any  of  the
                                      patterns  in  the set. To create a regex
                                      pattern set, see   CreateRegexPatternSet
                                      .

                                      Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement
                                      references a regex pattern set. You cre-
                                      ate  and maintain the set independent of
                                      your rules. This allows you to  use  the
                                      single  set  in multiple rules. When you
                                      update the referenced set, WAF automati-
                                      cally  updates  all rules that reference
                                      it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of
                                          the    RegexPatternSet   that   this
                                          statement references.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-
                                             ers.  This  is  the  part  of   a
                                             request  that  contains any addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to  your  web  server as the HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body
                                             are  forwarded to WAF for inspec-

                                             vice.   If   you  don't  need  to
                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can

                                                   text. WAF applies the  text

                                                   tion  criteria   that   you

                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs

                                   RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rate-based rule  tracks  the  rate  of
                                      requests   for   each   originating   IP
                                      address, and triggers  the  rule  action
                                      when  the  rate exceeds a limit that you
                                      specify on the number of requests in any
                                      5-minute  time span. You can use this to
                                      put a temporary block on  requests  from
                                      an  IP address that is sending excessive
                                      requests.

                                      WAF tracks and manages web requests sep-
                                      arately   for   each   instance   of   a
                                      rate-based rule that you use. For  exam-
                                      ple,  if you provide the same rate-based
                                      rule settings in two web ACLs,  each  of
                                      the  two  rule  statements  represents a
                                      separate instance of the rate-based rule
                                      and gets its own tracking and management
                                      by WAF. If you define a rate-based  rule
                                      inside  a  rule group, and then use that
                                      rule group in multiple places, each  use
                                      creates   a  separate  instance  of  the
                                      rate-based rule that gets its own track-
                                      ing and management by WAF.

                                      When   the  rule  action  triggers,  WAF
                                      blocks additional requests from  the  IP
                                      address  until  the  request  rate falls
                                      below the limit.

                                      You can optionally nest  another  state-
                                      ment inside the rate-based statement, to
                                      narrow the scope of the rule so that  it
                                      only  counts  requests  that  match  the
                                      nested statement. For example, based  on
                                      recent  requests that you have seen from
                                      an  attacker,   you   might   create   a
                                      rate-based  rule  with a nested AND rule
                                      statement that  contains  the  following
                                      nested statements:

                                      o An  IP  match statement with an IP set
                                        that specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                      o A string match statement that searches
                                        in  the  User-Agent  header  for   the
                                        string BadBot.

                                      In this rate-based rule, you also define
                                      a rate limit. For this example, the rate
                                      limit  is 1,000. Requests that meet both
                                      of the conditions in the statements  are
                                      counted.  If  the  count  exceeds  1,000
                                      requests  per  five  minutes,  the  rule
                                      action  triggers.  Requests  that do not
                                      meet both  conditions  are  not  counted
                                      towards  the  rate  limit  and  are  not
                                      affected by this rule.

                                      You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement
                                      inside  another  statement,  for example
                                      inside a NotStatement or  OrStatement  .
                                      You   can  define  a  RateBasedStatement
                                      inside a  web  ACL  and  inside  a  rule
                                      group.

                                      Limit -> (long)
                                          The  limit  on requests per 5-minute
                                          period for a single  originating  IP
                                          address. If the statement includes a
                                          ScopeDownStatement , this  limit  is
                                          applied  only  to  the requests that
                                          match the statement.

                                      AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                          Setting that indicates how to aggre-
                                          gate the request counts. The options
                                          are the following:

                                          o IP - Aggregate the request  counts
                                            on  the  IP  address  from the web
                                            request origin.

                                          o FORWARDED_IP   -   Aggregate   the
                                            request  counts  on  the  first IP
                                            address in an HTTP header. If  you

                                          address  that's  reported by the web
                                          request origin.  Commonly,  this  is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          This is required if AggregateKeyType
                                          is set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the HTTP header to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF) header, set this to  X-For-

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a valid  IP  address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                   AndStatement -> (structure)
                                      A logical rule statement used to combine
                                      other  rule  statements  with AND logic.
                                      You provide  more  than  one   Statement
                                      within the AndStatement .

                                      Statements -> (list)
                                          The  statements  to combine with AND
                                          logic. You can  use  any  statements
                                          that can be nested.

                                          ( ... recursive ... )

                                   OrStatement -> (structure)
                                      A logical rule statement used to combine
                                      other rule statements with OR logic. You
                                      provide  more than one  Statement within
                                      the OrStatement .

                                      Statements -> (list)
                                          The statements to  combine  with  OR
                                          logic.  You  can  use any statements
                                          that can be nested.

                                          ( ... recursive ... )

                                   NotStatement -> (structure)
                                      A logical rule statement used to  negate
                                      the  results  of another rule statement.
                                      You provide one   Statement  within  the
                                      NotStatement .

                                      ( ... recursive ... )

                                   ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement used to run the rules
                                      that  are  defined  in  a  managed  rule
                                      group.  To  use this, provide the vendor
                                      name and the name of the rule  group  in
                                      this  statement.  You  can  retrieve the
                                      required names  by  calling   ListAvail-
                                      ableManagedRuleGroups .

                                      You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupState-
                                      ment , for example for use inside a Not-
                                      Statement  or  OrStatement . It can only
                                      be referenced as a  top-level  statement
                                      within a rule.

                                      VendorName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of the managed rule group
                                          vendor. You use this, along with the
                                          rule  group  name,  to  identify the
                                          rule group.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the managed rule  group.
                                          You  use this, along with the vendor
                                          name, to identify the rule group.

                                      Version -> (string)
                                          The  version  of  the  managed  rule
                                          group  to  use. If you specify this,
                                          the version setting is  fixed  until
                                          you  change it. If you don't specify
                                          this, WAF uses the vendor's  default
                                          version,  and then keeps the version
                                          at the  vendor's  default  when  the
                                          vendor   updates  the  managed  rule
                                          group settings.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The rules  in  the  referenced  rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates  it exactly as it would if the
                                          rule action  setting  were  Count  .
                                          This  is a useful option for testing
                                          the rules in a  rule  group  without
                                          modifying  how  they handle your web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group  whose  action  you want to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it
                                             exactly as it would if  the  rule
                                             action  setting were Count . This
                                             is a useful  option  for  testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying how  they  handle  your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of  the rule whose
                                                 action you want  to  override
                                                 to Count .

                                      ( ... recursive ... )

                                   LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement that defines a string
                                      match search against  labels  that  have
                                      been  added  to the web request by rules
                                      that have already run in the web ACL.

                                      The label match statement  provides  the
                                      label or namespace string to search for.
                                      The label string can represent a part or
                                      all  of  the  fully qualified label name
                                      that had been added to the web  request.
                                      Fully  qualified  labels  have a prefix,
                                      optional namespaces, and label name. The
                                      prefix  identifies the rule group or web
                                      ACL context of the rule that  added  the
                                      label.  If  you do not provide the fully
                                      qualified  name  in  your  label   match
                                      string,  WAF  performs  the  search  for
                                      labels that were added in the same  con-
                                      text as the label match statement.

                                      Scope -> (string)
                                          Specify  whether  you  want to match
                                          using the label  name  or  just  the
                                          namespace.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          The  string  to  match  against. The
                                          setting you provide for this depends
                                          on  the match statement's Scope set-
                                          ting:

                                          o If the  Scope  indicates  LABEL  ,
                                            then   this   specification   must
                                            include the name and  can  include
                                            any  number of preceding namespace

                                            providing   the   fully  qualified
                                            label name.

                                          o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE ,
                                            then    this   specification   can
                                            include any number  of  contiguous
                                            namespace strings, and can include
                                            the entire label namespace  prefix
                                            from  the  rule  group  or web ACL
                                            where the label originates.

                                          Labels are case sensitive and compo-
                                          nents  of  a label must be separated
                                          by colon, for example NS1:NS2:name .

                                   RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  search web
                                      request components for a match against a
                                      single regular expression.

                                      RegexString -> (string)
                                          The  string representing the regular
                                          expression.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-
                                             ers.  This  is  the  part  of   a
                                             request  that  contains any addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to  your  web  server as the HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body

                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body of the web request, such  as

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect   the  HTTP  method.  The
                                             method  indicates  the  type   of

                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.

                                                 What  WAF  should  do  if  it
                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -
                                                   Inspect  the  body as plain
                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:
                                                   {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                                             Text   transformations  eliminate
                                             some of  the  unusual  formatting
                                             that   attackers   use   in   web
                                             requests in an effort  to  bypass
                                             detection.

                                                 est,  before  inspecting  the

                                                 be different.

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined  in  a managed rule group. To use this,
                               provide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the
                               rule  group in this statement. You can retrieve
                               the required names by calling   ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You  cannot  nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  It  can only be referenced as a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group  vendor.
                                   You  use  this,  along  with the rule group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this,  along with the vendor name, to iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The version of the managed  rule  group  to
                                   use.  If you specify this, the version set-
                                   ting is fixed until you change it.  If  you
                                   don't  specify  this, WAF uses the vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at  the  vendor's  default  when the vendor
                                   updates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                               ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                                   An optional nested statement  that  narrows
                                   the  scope  of  the  web  requests that are
                                   evaluated  by  the  managed   rule   group.
                                   Requests  are  only  evaluated  by the rule
                                   group if they match the  scope-down  state-
                                   ment.  You  can use any nestable  Statement
                                   in the scope-down statement,  and  you  can
                                   nest  statements  at any level, the same as
                                   you can for a rule statement.

                                   ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement that defines  a  string
                                      match  search  for  WAF  to apply to web
                                      requests. The byte match statement  pro-
                                      vides the bytes to search for, the loca-
                                      tion in requests that you  want  WAF  to
                                      search, and other settings. The bytes to
                                      search for are typically a  string  that
                                      corresponds  with  ASCII  characters. In
                                      the WAF console and the developer guide,
                                      this  is  refered  to  as a string match
                                      statement.

                                      SearchString -> (blob)
                                          A string value that you want WAF  to
                                          search for. WAF searches only in the
                                          part of web requests that you desig-
                                          nate for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                          . The maximum length of the value is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          Valid values depend on the component
                                          that you specify for  inspection  in
                                          FieldToMatch :

                                          o Method  : The HTTP method that you
                                            want WAF to search for. This indi-
                                            cates the type of operation speci-
                                            fied in the request.

                                          o UriPath : The value that you  want
                                            WAF to search for in the URI path,
                                            for example,  /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                            .

                                          If  SearchString includes alphabetic
                                          characters A-Z and  a-z,  note  that
                                          the value is case sensitive.
                                             If you're using the WAF API

                                          Specify  a base64-encoded version of
                                          the value. The maximum length of the
                                          value before you base64-encode it is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          For example, suppose  the  value  of
                                          Type is HEADER and the value of Data
                                          is  User-Agent  .  If  you  want  to
                                          search the User-Agent header for the
                                          value  BadBot  ,  you  base64-encode
                                          BadBot  using  MIME  base64-encoding
                                          and  include  the  resulting  value,
                                          QmFkQm90  ,  in the value of Search-
                                          String .
                                             If you're using the CLI or one of
                                             the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                          The  value  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                          search for.  The  SDK  automatically
                                          base64 encodes the value.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  query  argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-
                                             ers.   This  is  the  part  of  a
                                             request that contains  any  addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send

                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-

                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the

                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:

                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that

                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                                   SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule statement that compares a number
                                      of bytes against the size of  a  request
                                      component,  using a comparison operator,
                                      such as greater than (>)  or  less  than
                                      (<).  For  example,  you  can use a size
                                      constraint statement to look  for  query
                                      strings  that are longer than 100 bytes.

                                      If you  configure  WAF  to  inspect  the
                                      request  body,  WAF  inspects  only  the
                                      first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the  request
                                      body for your web requests never exceeds
                                      8192 bytes, you can create a  size  con-
                                      straint  condition  and  block  requests
                                      that have a request  body  greater  than
                                      8192 bytes.

                                      If  you choose URI for the value of Part
                                      of the request to filter on,  the  slash
                                      (/)  in the URI counts as one character.
                                      For example, the URI /logo.jpg  is  nine
                                      characters long.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             The  name  of  the HTTP header to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF) header, set this to  X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a valid  IP  address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                   RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement used to run  the  rules
                                      that  are  defined  in a  RuleGroup . To
                                      use this, create a rule group with  your
                                      rules,  then provide the ARN of the rule
                                      group in this statement.

                                      You cannot nest  a  RuleGroupReferenceS-
                                      tatement  , for example for use inside a
                                      NotStatement or OrStatement  .  You  can
                                      only  use  a rule group reference state-
                                      ment at the top level inside a web  ACL.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of
                                          the entity.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The rules  in  the  referenced  rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates  it exactly as it would if the
                                          rule action  setting  were  Count  .
                                          This  is a useful option for testing
                                          the rules in a  rule  group  without
                                          modifying  how  they handle your web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group  whose  action  you want to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it
                                             exactly as it would if  the  rule
                                             action  setting were Count . This
                                             is a useful  option  for  testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying how  they  handle  your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of  the rule whose
                                                 action you want  to  override
                                                 to Count .

                                   IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  detect web
                                      requests  coming  from   particular   IP
                                      addresses  or  address  ranges.  To  use
                                      this, create an   IPSet  that  specifies
                                      the  addresses  you want to detect, then
                                      use the ARN of that set in  this  state-
                                      ment.  To  create  an  IP set, see  Cre-
                                      ateIPSet .

                                      Each IP set rule statement references an
                                      IP  set. You create and maintain the set
                                      independent of your rules.  This  allows
                                      you  to  use  the single set in multiple
                                      rules. When you  update  the  referenced
                                      set, WAF automatically updates all rules
                                      that reference it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of
                                          the   IPSet that this statement ref-
                                          erences.

                                      IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                          The configuration for inspecting  IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify, instead  of  using  the  IP
                                          address  that's  reported by the web
                                          request origin.  Commonly,  this  is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF)  header, set this to X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                          Position -> (string)
                                             The  position  in  the  header to
                                             search for the  IP  address.  The
                                             header  can  contain IP addresses
                                             of the original client  and  also
                                             of   proxies.  For  example,  the
                                             header value could  be  10.1.1.1,
                                             127.0.0.0,  10.10.10.10 where the
                                             first IP address  identifies  the
                                             original   client  and  the  rest
                                             identify proxies that the request
                                             went through.

                                             The  options for this setting are
                                             the following:

                                             o FIRST - Inspect  the  first  IP
                                               address   in  the  list  of  IP
                                               addresses in the  header.  This
                                               is  usually the client's origi-
                                               nal IP.

                                   (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  search web
                                      request components for matches with reg-
                                      ular  expressions. To use this, create a
                                      RegexPatternSet   that   specifies   the
                                      expressions  that  you  want  to detect,
                                      then use the ARN of  that  set  in  this
                                      statement.  A  web  request  matches the
                                      pattern  set  rule  statement   if   the
                                      request  component  matches  any  of the
                                      patterns in the set. To create  a  regex
                                      pattern  set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet
                                      .

                                      Each regex pattern  set  rule  statement
                                      references a regex pattern set. You cre-
                                      ate and maintain the set independent  of
                                      your  rules.  This allows you to use the
                                      single set in multiple rules.  When  you
                                      update the referenced set, WAF automati-
                                      cally updates all rules  that  reference
                                      it.

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {

                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the

                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)

                                                 JSON body.  The  options  are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -
                                                   Inspect the body  as  plain
                                                   text.  WAF applies the text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion   criteria   that  you
                                                   defined   for   the    JSON

                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web
                                                   request   as  matching  the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the
                                                 following  examples  as   two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that

                                          effort to bypass detection.  If  you
                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                   RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rate-based  rule  tracks  the rate of
                                      requests   for   each   originating   IP
                                      address,  and  triggers  the rule action
                                      when the rate exceeds a limit  that  you
                                      specify on the number of requests in any
                                      5-minute time span. You can use this  to
                                      put  a  temporary block on requests from
                                      an IP address that is sending  excessive
                                      requests.

                                      WAF tracks and manages web requests sep-
                                      arately   for   each   instance   of   a
                                      rate-based  rule that you use. For exam-
                                      ple, if you provide the same  rate-based
                                      rule  settings  in two web ACLs, each of
                                      the two  rule  statements  represents  a
                                      separate instance of the rate-based rule
                                      and gets its own tracking and management
                                      by  WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                                      inside a rule group, and then  use  that
                                      rule  group in multiple places, each use
                                      creates  a  separate  instance  of   the
                                      rate-based rule that gets its own track-
                                      ing and management by WAF.

                                      When  the  rule  action  triggers,   WAF
                                      blocks  additional  requests from the IP
                                      address until  the  request  rate  falls
                                      below the limit.

                                      You  can  optionally nest another state-
                                      ment inside the rate-based statement, to
                                      narrow  the scope of the rule so that it
                                      only  counts  requests  that  match  the
                                      nested  statement. For example, based on
                                      recent requests that you have seen  from
                                      an   attacker,   you   might   create  a
                                      rate-based rule with a nested  AND  rule
                                      statement  that  contains  the following
                                      nested statements:

                                      o An IP match statement with an  IP  set
                                        that specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                      o A string match statement that searches
                                        in   the  User-Agent  header  for  the
                                        string BadBot.

                                      In this rate-based rule, you also define
                                      a rate limit. For this example, the rate
                                      limit is 1,000. Requests that meet  both
                                      of  the conditions in the statements are
                                      counted.  If  the  count  exceeds  1,000
                                      requests  per  five  minutes,  the  rule
                                      action triggers. Requests  that  do  not
                                      meet  both  conditions  are  not counted
                                      towards  the  rate  limit  and  are  not
                                      affected by this rule.

                                      You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement
                                      inside another  statement,  for  example
                                      inside  a  NotStatement or OrStatement .
                                      You  can  define  a   RateBasedStatement
                                      inside  a  web  ACL  and  inside  a rule
                                      group.

                                      Limit -> (long)
                                          The limit on requests  per  5-minute
                                          period  for  a single originating IP
                                          address. If the statement includes a
                                          ScopeDownStatement  ,  this limit is
                                          applied only to  the  requests  that
                                          match the statement.

                                      AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                          Setting that indicates how to aggre-
                                          gate the request counts. The options
                                          are the following:

                                          o IP  - Aggregate the request counts
                                            on the IP  address  from  the  web
                                            request origin.

                                          o FORWARDED_IP   -   Aggregate   the
                                            request counts  on  the  first  IP
                                            address  in an HTTP header. If you
                                            use  this,  configure   the   For-
                                            wardedIPConfig  ,  to  specify the
                                            header to use.

                                      ( ... recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig
                                      -> (structure)
                                          The  configuration for inspecting IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify,  instead  of  using  the IP
                                          address that's reported by  the  web
                                          request  origin.  Commonly,  this is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          This is required if AggregateKeyType
                                          is set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF)  header, set this to X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the

                                      You  provide  more  than  one  Statement
                                      within the AndStatement .

                                      Statements -> (list)
                                          The statements to combine  with  AND
                                          logic.  You  can  use any statements

                                   NotStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  logical rule statement used to negate
                                      the results of another  rule  statement.
                                      You  provide  one   Statement within the
                                      NotStatement .

                                   (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement that defines a string
                                      match search against  labels  that  have
                                      been  added  to the web request by rules
                                      that have already run in the web ACL.

                                      The label match statement  provides  the
                                      label or namespace string to search for.
                                      The label string can represent a part or
                                      all  of  the  fully qualified label name
                                      that had been added to the web  request.
                                      Fully  qualified  labels  have a prefix,
                                      optional namespaces, and label name. The
                                      prefix  identifies the rule group or web
                                      ACL context of the rule that  added  the
                                      label.  If  you do not provide the fully
                                      qualified  name  in  your  label   match
                                      string,  WAF  performs  the  search  for
                                      labels that were added in the same  con-
                                      text as the label match statement.

                                      Scope -> (string)
                                          Specify  whether  you  want to match
                                          using the label  name  or  just  the
                                          namespace.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          The  string  to  match  against. The
                                          setting you provide for this depends
                                          on  the match statement's Scope set-
                                          ting:

                                          o If the  Scope  indicates  LABEL  ,
                                            then   this   specification   must
                                            include the name and  can  include
                                            any  number of preceding namespace
                                            specifications and  prefix  up  to
                                            providing   the   fully  qualified
                                            label name.

                                          o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE ,
                                            then    this   specification   can
                                            include any number  of  contiguous
                                            namespace strings, and can include
                                            the entire label namespace  prefix
                                            from  the  rule  group  or web ACL
                                            where the label originates.

                                          Labels are case sensitive and compo-
                                          nents  of  a label must be separated
                                          by colon, for example NS1:NS2:name .

                                   RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  search web
                                      request components for a match against a
                                      single regular expression.

                                      RegexString -> (string)
                                          The  string representing the regular
                                          expression.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-
                                             ers.  This  is  the  part  of   a
                                             request  that  contains any addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to  your  web  server as the HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body
                                             are  forwarded to WAF for inspec-

                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body of the web request, such  as
                                             ByteMatchStatement  or  RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces an 8 KB  size  limit  on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of web requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect   the  HTTP  method.  The
                                             method  indicates  the  type   of
                                             operation  that  the  request  is
                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.
                                             The request body immediately fol-
                                             lows the request headers. This is
                                             the  part  of a request that con-
                                             tains any  additional  data  that
                                             you  want  to  send  to  your web

                                             ByteMatchStatement  or  RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces an 8 KB  size  limit  on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of web requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                                 inspection criteria.

                                                 All -> (structure)
                                                    Match all of the elements.

                                                    You  must  specify  either
                                                    this   setting   or    the

                                                    not both.

                                                 IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                    Match only  the  specified

                                                    NOTE:
                                                        Don't  use this option
                                                        to include all  paths.
                                                        Instead,  use  the All

                                                 What  WAF  should  do  if  it
                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -
                                                   Inspect  the  body as plain
                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:
                                                   {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      TextTransformations -> (list)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                                             Text   transformations  eliminate
                                             some of  the  unusual  formatting
                                             that   attackers   use   in   web

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  against  labels that have been added to
                               the web request by rules that have already  run
                               in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                               prefix  identifies  the  rule  group or web ACL
                               context of the rule that added  the  label.  If
                               you  do not provide the fully qualified name in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search  for  labels that were added in the same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  string  to  match against. The setting
                                   you provide for this depends on  the  match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this
                                     specification must include the  name  and
                                     can   include  any  number  of  preceding
                                     namespace specifications and prefix up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE  ,  then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of contiguous namespace strings, and  can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from the rule group or web ACL where  the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be  separated  by  colon,  for
                                   example NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             JS_DECODE  -  Decode   JavaScript
                                             escape sequences. If a \  u  HHHH
                                             code is in the  full-width  ASCII

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             LOWERCASE   -  Convert  uppercase

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all NULL

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS -  Replace  each
                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a

                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS  -   Replace   NULL

                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             ,   but    with    support    for

                                             If the code is in the  full-width
                                             ASCII  code  range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                     RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement  used  to  run  the  rules  that  are
                        defined  in  a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule
                        group with your rules, then provide  the  ARN  of  the
                        rule group in this statement.

                        You  cannot  nest  a RuleGroupReferenceStatement , for
                        example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        You  can  only use a rule group reference statement at
                        the top level inside a web ACL.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group  whose
                            actions  are  set  to  Count  . When you exclude a
                            rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                            rule  action setting were Count . This is a useful
                            option for testing the rules in a rule group with-
                            out modifying how they handle your web traffic.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies  a  single rule in a rule group whose
                               action you want to override to Count . When you
                               exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                               would if the rule action setting were  Count  .
                               This  is  a useful option for testing the rules
                               in a rule group without modifying how they han-
                               dle your web traffic.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                 OverrideAction -> (structure)
                     The action to use in the place of the action that results
                     from  the  rule group evaluation. Set the override action
                     to none to leave the result of the rule group alone.  Set
                     it to count to override the result to count only.

                     You  can only use this for rule statements that reference
                     a rule group, like RuleGroupReferenceStatement  and  Man-
                     agedRuleGroupStatement .

                     NOTE:
                        This option is usually set to none. It does not affect
                        how the rules in the rule group are evaluated. If  you
                        want  the  rules  in  the  rule  group  to  only count
                        matches, do not use this  and  instead  exclude  those
                        rules in your rule group reference statement settings.

                     Count -> (structure)
                        Override the rule group  evaluation  result  to  count
                        only.

                        NOTE:
                            This  option  is  usually set to none. It does not
                            affect how the rules in the rule group are  evalu-
                            ated.  If  you want the rules in the rule group to
                            only count matches, do not use  this  and  instead
                            exclude  those  rules in your rule group reference
                            statement settings.

                        CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)
                            Defines custom handling for the web request.

                            For information about customizing web requests and
                            responses,   see   Customizing  web  requests  and
                            responses in WAF in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            InsertHeaders -> (list)
                               The HTTP headers to insert  into  the  request.
                               Duplicate header names are not allowed.

                               For  information  about the limits on count and
                               size for custom request and response  settings,

                               (structure)
                                   A  custom  header  for  custom  request and
                                   response handling. This is used in  Custom-
                                   Response and  CustomRequestHandling .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the custom header.

                                      For  custom  request  header  insertion,
                                      when WAF inserts  the  header  into  the
                                      request,    it    prefixes   this   name
                                      x-amzn-waf- , to  avoid  confusion  with
                                      the  headers  that  are  already  in the
                                      request. For  example,  for  the  header
                                      name  sample  ,  WAF  inserts the header
                                      x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The value of the custom header.

                     None -> (structure)
                        Don't override the rule group evaluation result.  This
                        is the most common setting.

                 VisibilityConfig -> (structure)
                     Defines  and  enables  Amazon  CloudWatch metrics and web
                     request sample collection.

                     SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                        A boolean indicating whether WAF should store  a  sam-
                        pling  of  the  web requests that match the rules. You
                        can view the sampled requests through the WAF console.

                     CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                        A  boolean  indicating whether the associated resource
                        sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. For  the  list  of
                        available metrics, see WAF Metrics .

                     MetricName -> (string)
                        A  name  of the Amazon CloudWatch metric. The name can
                        contain  only  the  characters:  A-Z,  a-z,   0-9,   -
                        (hyphen), and _ (underscore). The name can be from one
                        to 128 characters long. It can't contain whitespace or
                        metric  names  reserved for WAF, for example "All" and
                        "Default_Action."

          PostProcessFirewallManagerRuleGroups -> (list)
              The last set of rules for WAF to process in the web ACL. This is
              defined in an Firewall Manager WAF policy and contains only rule
              group references. You can't alter  these.  Any  rules  and  rule
              groups  that  you  define for the web ACL are prioritized before
              these.

              In the Firewall Manager WAF policy, the Firewall Manager  admin-
              istrator can define a set of rule groups to run first in the web
              ACL and a set of rule groups to run last. Within each  set,  the
              administrator  prioritizes  the  rule groups, to determine their
              relative processing order.

              (structure)
                 A rule group that's defined for an Firewall Manager WAF  pol-
                 icy.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the rule group. You cannot change the name of
                     a rule group after you create it.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     If you define more than one rule group in  the  first  or
                     last  Firewall  Manager  rule  groups, WAF evaluates each
                     request against the rule groups in order,  starting  from
                     the lowest priority setting. The priorities don't need to
                     be consecutive, but they must all be different.

                 FirewallManagerStatement -> (structure)
                     The processing guidance for  an  Firewall  Manager  rule.
                     This  is like a regular rule  Statement , but it can only
                     contain a rule group reference.

                     ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement  used  to  run  the  rules  that  are
                        defined  in a managed rule group. To use this, provide
                        the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this
                        statement.  You  can  retrieve  the  required names by
                        calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                        You cannot  nest  a  ManagedRuleGroupStatement  ,  for
                        example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        It can only be referenced  as  a  top-level  statement
                        within a rule.

                        VendorName -> (string)
                            The name of the managed rule group vendor. You use
                            this, along with the rule group name, to  identify
                            the rule group.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name of the managed rule group. You use this,
                            along with the vendor name, to identify  the  rule
                            group.

                        Version -> (string)
                            The  version  of the managed rule group to use. If
                            you specify this, the  version  setting  is  fixed
                            until  you  change  it. If you don't specify this,
                            WAF uses the vendor's default  version,  and  then
                            keeps the version at the vendor's default when the
                            vendor updates the managed rule group settings.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group  whose
                            actions  are  set  to  Count  . When you exclude a
                            rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                            rule  action setting were Count . This is a useful
                            option for testing the rules in a rule group with-
                            out modifying how they handle your web traffic.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies  a  single rule in a rule group whose
                               action you want to override to Count . When you
                               exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                               would if the rule action setting were  Count  .
                               This  is  a useful option for testing the rules
                               in a rule group without modifying how they han-
                               dle your web traffic.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                        ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                            An optional  nested  statement  that  narrows  the
                            scope  of  the  web requests that are evaluated by
                            the managed rule group. Requests are  only  evalu-
                            ated   by   the  rule  group  if  they  match  the
                            scope-down statement. You  can  use  any  nestable
                            Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can
                            nest statements at any level, the same as you  can
                            for a rule statement.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this  is  ref-
                               ered to as a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 50 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type   of   operation  specified  in  the
                                     request.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The  maximum  length  of  the value
                                   before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode     BadBot     using     MIME
                                   base64-encoding  and  include the resulting
                                   value, QmFkQm90 , in the value  of  Search-
                                   String .
                                      If  you're  using  the CLI or one of the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The value that you want WAF to search  for.
                                   The  SDK  automatically  base64 encodes the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations.  These  are  helpful  in

                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                             combination  of  a  backslash and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,      ja\vascript     for
                                             javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of
                                             hexadecimal   characters  into  a

                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               Attackers sometimes insert malicious  SQL  code
                               into  web requests in an effort to extract data
                               from your  database.  To  allow  or  block  web
                               requests  that  appear to contain malicious SQL
                               code, create one or more  SQL  injection  match
                               conditions.  An  SQL  injection match condition
                               identifies the part of web  requests,  such  as
                               the  URI or the query string, that you want WAF
                               to inspect. Later in the process, when you cre-
                               ate  a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or
                               block requests that appear to contain malicious
                               SQL code.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH - Remove  multiple
                                             slashes,   directory  self-refer-
                                             ences, and directory  back-refer-
                                             ences  that are not at the begin-
                                             ning of the input from  an  input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is the
                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS -  Remove  all  NULL
                                             bytes from the input.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS  -  Replace each
                                             occurrence of a  C-style  comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple consecutive  occurrences
                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS   -   Replace  NULL
                                             bytes in  the  input  with  space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode SQL hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE
                                             ,    but    with    support   for
                                             Microsoft-specific  %u  encoding.
                                             If  the code is in the full-width
                                             ASCII code range of  FF01-FF5E  ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert   all
                                             UTF-8 character sequences to Uni-
                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion,  and minimizing false-posi-
                                             tives  and  false-negatives   for
                                             non-English languages.

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  defines  a cross-site
                               scripting (XSS) match search for WAF  to  apply
                               to  web  requests.  XSS attacks are those where
                               the attacker uses vulnerabilities in  a  benign
                               website   as  a  vehicle  to  inject  malicious
                               client-site scripts into other  legitimate  web
                               browsers.  The XSS match statement provides the
                               location in  requests  that  you  want  WAF  to
                               search  and  text transformations to use on the
                               search area before WAF searches  for  character
                               sequences  that  are  likely  to  be  malicious
                               strings.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as

                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a

                                             code is in the  full-width  ASCII
                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             LOWERCASE   -  Convert  uppercase
                                             letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                             MD5  - Calculate an MD5 hash from
                                             the data in the input.  The  com-
                                             puted  hash  is  in  a raw binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE - Specify NONE if you  don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH  - Remove multiple
                                             slashes,  directory   self-refer-
                                             ences,  and directory back-refer-

                                             ning  of  the input from an input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all NULL

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS -  Replace  each
                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                             standalone  termination of a com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS  -   Replace   NULL
                                             bytes  in  the  input  with space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             ,   but    with    support    for
                                             Microsoft-specific  %u  encoding.
                                             If the code is in the  full-width
                                             ASCII  code  range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all
                                             UTF-8 character sequences to Uni-
                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion, and minimizing  false-posi-
                                             tives   and  false-negatives  for
                                             non-English languages.

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement  that  compares  a  number  of
                               bytes  against the size of a request component,
                               using a comparison operator,  such  as  greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use a size constraint  statement  to  look  for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If  you  configure  WAF  to inspect the request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB).  If the request body for your web requests
                               never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size
                               constraint  condition  and  block requests that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If you choose URI for the value of Part of  the
                               request  to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI
                               counts as one character. For example,  the  URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the  query  header to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the   name  of  the  query  argument  to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      .  The  name  can be up to 30 characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies   a    resource,    for    example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't   use  this  option  to
                                                 include all  paths.  Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies  the  rule  action  to the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire  JSON  body,  but  might   be
                                          forced  to  stop for reasons such as
                                          invalid characters, duplicate  keys,
                                          truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                          root node  isn't  an  object  or  an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte,  to  compare  to  the
                                   request part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in  web  requests  in  an effort to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content. The priorities  don't  need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                          o Delete spaces before the following

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can   help   to
                                             uncover   ASCII  characters  that
                                             were encoded using  CSS  encoding
                                             that    wouldnt    typically   be
                                             encoded.  It's  also  useful   in
                                             countering  evasion,  which  is a

                                             code range of  FF01-FF5E  ,  then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:

                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching   the   rule  statement.  WAF
                                        applies  the  rule   action   to   the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule group with your rules,  then  provide  the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  You  can  only use a rule group
                               reference statement at the top level  inside  a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   entity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to  detect  web  requests
                               coming  from particular IP addresses or address
                               ranges. To use  this,  create  an   IPSet  that
                               specifies  the  addresses  you  want to detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each  IP  set  rule  statement references an IP
                               set. You create and maintain the  set  indepen-
                               dent  of your rules. This allows you to use the
                               single set in multiple rules. When  you  update
                               the  referenced  set, WAF automatically updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching   the   rule  statement.  WAF
                                        applies  the  rule   action   to   the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the  IP  address. The header can contain
                                      IP addresses of the original client  and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value  could  be  10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10  where  the first IP address
                                      identifies the original client  and  the
                                      rest  identify  proxies that the request
                                      went through.

                                      The options for  this  setting  are  the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address
                                        in the list of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.  This  is usually the client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST - Inspect the last IP address  in
                                        the   list  of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in  the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains more than 10 IP  addresses,  WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for  matches  with  regular  expres-
                               sions.  To  use this, create a  RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect,  then  use  the ARN of that set in this
                               statement. A web request  matches  the  pattern
                               set  rule  statement  if  the request component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate  a  regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each regex pattern set  rule  statement  refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain the set independent of  your  rules.  This
                               allows  you  to  use the single set in multiple
                               rules. When you update the referenced set,  WAF
                               automatically  updates all rules that reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in

                               for  each  originating IP address, and triggers
                               the rule action when the rate exceeds  a  limit
                               that  you  specify on the number of requests in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a  temporary  block  on  requests  from  an  IP
                               address that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF tracks and manages web requests  separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use. For  example,  if  you  provide  the  same
                               rate-based  rule settings in two web ACLs, each
                               of the two rule statements represents  a  sepa-
                               rate  instance  of the rate-based rule and gets
                               its own tracking and management by WAF. If  you
                               define  a  rate-based rule inside a rule group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the rate-based rule that gets its own  tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional requests from the IP address  until  the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You   can  optionally  nest  another  statement
                               inside the rate-based statement, to narrow  the
                               scope  of  the  rule  so  that  it  only counts
                               requests that match the nested  statement.  For
                               example, based on recent requests that you have
                               seen from  an  attacker,  you  might  create  a
                               rate-based  rule  with a nested AND rule state-
                               ment that contains the following nested  state-
                               ments:

                               o An  IP  match  statement  with an IP set that
                                 specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit. For this  example,  the  rate  limit  is
                               1,000.  Requests  that  meet both of the condi-
                               tions in the statements  are  counted.  If  the
                               count  exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes,
                               the rule action triggers. Requests that do  not
                               meet  both  conditions  are not counted towards
                               the rate limit and are  not  affected  by  this
                               rule.

                               You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement inside
                               another statement, for example  inside  a  Not-
                               Statement  or  OrStatement  .  You can define a
                               RateBasedStatement inside a web ACL and  inside
                               a rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The  limit  on requests per 5-minute period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement  includes  a ScopeDownStatement ,
                                   this limit is applied only to the  requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header. If you use  this,  configure  the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                                   An optional nested statement  that  narrows
                                   the  scope  of  the  web  requests that are
                                   evaluated  by  the  rate-based   statement.
                                   Requests are only tracked by the rate-based
                                   statement  if  they  match  the  scope-down
                                   statement. You can use any nestable  State-
                                   ment in the scope-down statement,  and  you
                                   can  nest statements at any level, the same
                                   as you can for a rule statement.

                                   ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement that defines  a  string
                                      match  search  for  WAF  to apply to web
                                      requests. The byte match statement  pro-
                                      vides the bytes to search for, the loca-
                                      tion in requests that you  want  WAF  to
                                      search, and other settings. The bytes to
                                      search for are typically a  string  that
                                      corresponds  with  ASCII  characters. In
                                      the WAF console and the developer guide,
                                      this  is  refered  to  as a string match
                                      statement.

                                      SearchString -> (blob)
                                          A string value that you want WAF  to
                                          search for. WAF searches only in the
                                          part of web requests that you desig-
                                          nate for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                          . The maximum length of the value is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          Valid values depend on the component
                                          that you specify for  inspection  in
                                          FieldToMatch :

                                          o Method  : The HTTP method that you
                                            want WAF to search for. This indi-
                                            cates the type of operation speci-
                                            fied in the request.

                                          o UriPath : The value that you  want
                                            WAF to search for in the URI path,
                                            for example,  /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                            .

                                          If  SearchString includes alphabetic
                                          characters A-Z and  a-z,  note  that
                                          the value is case sensitive.
                                             If you're using the WAF API

                                          Specify  a base64-encoded version of
                                          the value. The maximum length of the
                                          value before you base64-encode it is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          For example, suppose  the  value  of
                                          Type is HEADER and the value of Data
                                          is  User-Agent  .  If  you  want  to
                                          search the User-Agent header for the
                                          value  BadBot  ,  you  base64-encode
                                          BadBot  using  MIME  base64-encoding
                                          and  include  the  resulting  value,
                                          QmFkQm90  ,  in the value of Search-
                                          String .
                                             If you're using the CLI or one of
                                             the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                          The  value  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                          search for.  The  SDK  automatically
                                          base64 encodes the value.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  query  argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-

                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to your web server  as  the  HTTP

                                             inspect  more  than 8 KB, you can
                                             guarantee that  you  don't  allow

                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-
                                             ers.  This  is  the  part  of   a
                                             request  that  contains any addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to  your  web  server as the HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body
                                             are  forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                             tion by the underlying host  ser-
                                             vice.   If   you  don't  need  to
                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body of the web request, such  as
                                             ByteMatchStatement  or  RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces an 8 KB  size  limit  on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of web requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect   the  HTTP  method.  The
                                             method  indicates  the  type   of
                                             operation  that  the  request  is
                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.
                                             The request body immediately fol-
                                             lows the request headers. This is
                                             the  part  of a request that con-
                                             tains any  additional  data  that
                                             you  want  to  send  to  your web
                                             server as the HTTP request  body,
                                             such as data from a form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB

                                                 What  WAF  should  do  if  it
                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                   text. WAF applies the  text

                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON

                                                   string.

                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the

                                                 The name of the  query  argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  HTTP  method.   The
                                             method   indicates  the  type  of

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON body.  The  options  are
                                                 the following:

                                                   tion   criteria   that  you
                                                   defined   for   the    JSON

                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the
                                                 following  examples  as   two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          effort to bypass detection.  If  you
                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                   SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule statement that compares a number
                                      of bytes against the size of  a  request
                                      component,  using a comparison operator,
                                      such as greater than (>)  or  less  than
                                      (<).  For  example,  you  can use a size
                                      constraint statement to look  for  query
                                      strings  that are longer than 100 bytes.

                                      If you  configure  WAF  to  inspect  the
                                      request  body,  WAF  inspects  only  the
                                      first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the  request
                                      body for your web requests never exceeds
                                      8192 bytes, you can create a  size  con-
                                      straint  condition  and  block  requests
                                      that have a request  body  greater  than
                                      8192 bytes.

                                      If  you choose URI for the value of Part
                                      of the request to filter on,  the  slash
                                      (/)  in the URI counts as one character.
                                      For example, the URI /logo.jpg  is  nine
                                      characters long.

                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  query  argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-
                                             ers.   This  is  the  part  of  a
                                             request that contains  any  addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to your web server  as  the  HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note that only  the  first  8  KB
                                             (8192  bytes) of the request body
                                             are forwarded to WAF for  inspec-
                                             tion  by the underlying host ser-
                                             vice.  If  you  don't   need   to
                                             inspect  more  than 8 KB, you can
                                             guarantee that  you  don't  allow
                                             additional  bytes in by combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body  of the web request, such as
                                             ByteMatchStatement or   RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement  , with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces  an  8  KB size limit on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire contents of  web  requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  HTTP  method.   The
                                             method   indicates  the  type  of
                                             operation  that  the  request  is
                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.
                                             The request body immediately fol-
                                             lows the request headers. This is
                                             the part of a request  that  con-
                                             tains  any  additional  data that
                                             you want  to  send  to  your  web
                                             server  as the HTTP request body,
                                             such as data from a form.

                                                   tion   criteria   that  you
                                                   defined   for   the    JSON

                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or

                                          The  operator  to use to compare the
                                          request part to the size setting.

                                      Size -> (long)
                                          The size, in byte, to compare to the

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that

                                          specify,  instead  of  using  the IP
                                          address that's reported by  the  web
                                          request  origin.  Commonly,  this is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the HTTP header to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF) header, set this to  X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a valid  IP  address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                   RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement used to run  the  rules
                                      that  are  defined  in a  RuleGroup . To
                                      use this, create a rule group with  your
                                      rules,  then provide the ARN of the rule
                                      group in this statement.

                                      You cannot nest  a  RuleGroupReferenceS-
                                      tatement  , for example for use inside a
                                      NotStatement or OrStatement  .  You  can
                                      only  use  a rule group reference state-
                                      ment at the top level inside a web  ACL.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of
                                          the entity.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The rules  in  the  referenced  rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates  it exactly as it would if the
                                          rule action  setting  were  Count  .
                                          This  is a useful option for testing
                                          the rules in a  rule  group  without
                                          modifying  how  they handle your web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group  whose  action  you want to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it
                                             exactly as it would if  the  rule
                                             action  setting were Count . This
                                             is a useful  option  for  testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying how  they  handle  your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of  the rule whose
                                                 action you want  to  override
                                                 to Count .

                                   IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  detect web
                                      requests  coming  from   particular   IP
                                      addresses  or  address  ranges.  To  use
                                      this, create an   IPSet  that  specifies
                                      the  addresses  you want to detect, then
                                      use the ARN of that set in  this  state-
                                      ment.  To  create  an  IP set, see  Cre-
                                      ateIPSet .

                                      Each IP set rule statement references an
                                      IP  set. You create and maintain the set
                                      independent of your rules.  This  allows
                                      you  to  use  the single set in multiple
                                      rules. When you  update  the  referenced
                                      set, WAF automatically updates all rules
                                      that reference it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of
                                          the   IPSet that this statement ref-
                                          erences.

                                      IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                          The configuration for inspecting  IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify, instead  of  using  the  IP
                                          address  that's  reported by the web
                                          request origin.  Commonly,  this  is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF)  header, set this to X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                          Position -> (string)
                                             The  position  in  the  header to
                                             search for the  IP  address.  The
                                             header  can  contain IP addresses
                                             of the original client  and  also
                                             of   proxies.  For  example,  the
                                             header value could  be  10.1.1.1,
                                             127.0.0.0,  10.10.10.10 where the
                                             first IP address  identifies  the
                                             original   client  and  the  rest
                                             identify proxies that the request
                                             went through.

                                             The  options for this setting are
                                             the following:

                                             o FIRST - Inspect  the  first  IP
                                               address   in  the  list  of  IP
                                               addresses in the  header.  This
                                               is  usually the client's origi-
                                               nal IP.

                                             o LAST  -  Inspect  the  last  IP
                                               address   in  the  list  of  IP
                                               addresses in the header.

                                             o ANY - Inspect all IP  addresses
                                               in  the  header for a match. If
                                               the header contains  more  than
                                               10  IP  addresses, WAF inspects
                                               the last 10.

                                   RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement        ->
                                   (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  search web
                                      request components for matches with reg-
                                      ular  expressions. To use this, create a
                                      RegexPatternSet   that   specifies   the
                                      expressions  that  you  want  to detect,
                                      then use the ARN of  that  set  in  this
                                      statement.  A  web  request  matches the
                                      pattern  set  rule  statement   if   the
                                      request  component  matches  any  of the
                                      patterns in the set. To create  a  regex
                                      pattern  set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet
                                      .

                                      Each regex pattern  set  rule  statement
                                      references a regex pattern set. You cre-
                                      ate and maintain the set independent  of
                                      your  rules.  This allows you to use the
                                      single set in multiple rules.  When  you
                                      update the referenced set, WAF automati-
                                      cally updates all rules  that  reference
                                      it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of
                                          the    RegexPatternSet   that   this
                                          statement references.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  query  argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-
                                             ers.   This  is  the  part  of  a
                                             request that contains  any  addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to your web server  as  the  HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note that only  the  first  8  KB
                                             (8192  bytes) of the request body

                                             vice.  If  you  don't   need   to
                                             inspect  more  than 8 KB, you can
                                             guarantee that  you  don't  allow
                                             additional  bytes in by combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body  of the web request, such as
                                             ByteMatchStatement or   RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement  , with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces  an  8  KB size limit on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF

                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  HTTP  method.   The
                                             method   indicates  the  type  of
                                             operation  that  the  request  is
                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.

                                                    not both.

                                                 JSON body.  The  options  are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -

                                                   text.  WAF applies the text

                                                   tion   criteria   that  you
                                                   defined   for   the    JSON

                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web
                                                   request   as  matching  the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the
                                                 following  examples  as   two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.  If  you
                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                   RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rate-based  rule  tracks  the rate of
                                      requests   for   each   originating   IP
                                      address,  and  triggers  the rule action
                                      when the rate exceeds a limit  that  you
                                      specify on the number of requests in any
                                      5-minute time span. You can use this  to
                                      put  a  temporary block on requests from
                                      an IP address that is sending  excessive
                                      requests.

                                      WAF tracks and manages web requests sep-
                                      arately   for   each   instance   of   a
                                      rate-based  rule that you use. For exam-
                                      ple, if you provide the same  rate-based
                                      rule  settings  in two web ACLs, each of
                                      the two  rule  statements  represents  a
                                      separate instance of the rate-based rule
                                      and gets its own tracking and management
                                      by  WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                                      inside a rule group, and then  use  that
                                      rule  group in multiple places, each use
                                      creates  a  separate  instance  of   the
                                      rate-based rule that gets its own track-
                                      ing and management by WAF.

                                      When  the  rule  action  triggers,   WAF
                                      blocks  additional  requests from the IP
                                      address until  the  request  rate  falls
                                      below the limit.

                                      You  can  optionally nest another state-
                                      ment inside the rate-based statement, to
                                      narrow  the scope of the rule so that it
                                      only  counts  requests  that  match  the
                                      nested  statement. For example, based on
                                      recent requests that you have seen  from
                                      an   attacker,   you   might   create  a
                                      rate-based rule with a nested  AND  rule
                                      statement  that  contains  the following
                                      nested statements:

                                      o An IP match statement with an  IP  set
                                        that specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                      o A string match statement that searches
                                        in   the  User-Agent  header  for  the
                                        string BadBot.

                                      In this rate-based rule, you also define
                                      a rate limit. For this example, the rate
                                      limit is 1,000. Requests that meet  both
                                      of  the conditions in the statements are
                                      counted.  If  the  count  exceeds  1,000
                                      requests  per  five  minutes,  the  rule
                                      action triggers. Requests  that  do  not
                                      meet  both  conditions  are  not counted
                                      towards  the  rate  limit  and  are  not
                                      affected by this rule.

                                      You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement
                                      inside another  statement,  for  example
                                      inside  a  NotStatement or OrStatement .
                                      You  can  define  a   RateBasedStatement
                                      inside  a  web  ACL  and  inside  a rule
                                      group.

                                      Limit -> (long)
                                          The limit on requests  per  5-minute
                                          period  for  a single originating IP
                                          address. If the statement includes a
                                          ScopeDownStatement  ,  this limit is
                                          applied only to  the  requests  that
                                          match the statement.

                                      AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                          Setting that indicates how to aggre-
                                          gate the request counts. The options
                                          are the following:

                                          o IP  - Aggregate the request counts
                                            on the IP  address  from  the  web
                                            request origin.

                                          o FORWARDED_IP   -   Aggregate   the
                                            request counts  on  the  first  IP
                                            address  in an HTTP header. If you
                                            use  this,  configure   the   For-
                                            wardedIPConfig  ,  to  specify the
                                            header to use.

                                      ( ... recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig
                                      -> (structure)
                                          The  configuration for inspecting IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify,  instead  of  using  the IP
                                          address that's reported by  the  web
                                          request  origin.  Commonly,  this is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          This is required if AggregateKeyType
                                          is set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF)  header, set this to X-For-

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                   AndStatement -> (structure)
                                      A logical rule statement used to combine
                                      other rule statements  with  AND  logic.
                                      You  provide  more  than  one  Statement
                                      within the AndStatement .

                                      Statements -> (list)
                                          The statements to combine  with  AND

                                   OrStatement -> (structure)
                                      A logical rule statement used to combine
                                      other rule statements with OR logic. You
                                      provide more than one  Statement  within
                                      the OrStatement .

                                      Statements -> (list)
                                          The  statements  to  combine with OR
                                          logic. You can  use  any  statements
                                          that can be nested.

                                   NotStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  logical rule statement used to negate
                                      the results of another  rule  statement.
                                      You  provide  one   Statement within the
                                      NotStatement .

                                      ( ... recursive ... )

                                   ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement used to run  the  rules
                                      that  are  defined  in  a  managed  rule
                                      group. To use this, provide  the  vendor
                                      name  and  the name of the rule group in
                                      this statement.  You  can  retrieve  the
                                      required  names  by  calling  ListAvail-
                                      ableManagedRuleGroups .

                                      You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupState-
                                      ment , for example for use inside a Not-
                                      Statement or OrStatement . It  can  only
                                      be  referenced  as a top-level statement
                                      within a rule.

                                      VendorName -> (string)
                                          The name of the managed  rule  group
                                          vendor. You use this, along with the
                                          rule group  name,  to  identify  the
                                          rule group.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the managed rule group.
                                          You use this, along with the  vendor
                                          name, to identify the rule group.

                                      Version -> (string)
                                          The  version  of  the  managed  rule
                                          group to use. If you  specify  this,
                                          the  version  setting is fixed until
                                          you change it. If you don't  specify
                                          this,  WAF uses the vendor's default
                                          version, and then keeps the  version
                                          at  the  vendor's  default  when the
                                          vendor  updates  the  managed   rule
                                          group settings.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The  rules  in  the  referenced rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates it exactly as it would if  the
                                          rule  action  setting  were  Count .
                                          This is a useful option for  testing
                                          the  rules  in  a rule group without
                                          modifying how they handle  your  web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group whose action  you  want  to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude a rule, WAF evaluates  it
                                             exactly  as  it would if the rule
                                             action setting were Count .  This
                                             is  a  useful  option for testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying  how  they  handle your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of  the  rule  whose
                                                 action  you  want to override
                                                 to Count .

                                   LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement that defines  a  string
                                      match  search  against  labels that have
                                      been added to the web request  by  rules
                                      that have already run in the web ACL.

                                      The  label  match statement provides the
                                      label or namespace string to search for.
                                      The label string can represent a part or
                                      all of the fully  qualified  label  name
                                      that  had been added to the web request.
                                      Fully qualified labels  have  a  prefix,
                                      optional namespaces, and label name. The
                                      prefix identifies the rule group or  web
                                      ACL  context  of the rule that added the
                                      label. If you do not provide  the  fully
                                      qualified   name  in  your  label  match
                                      string,  WAF  performs  the  search  for
                                      labels  that were added in the same con-
                                      text as the label match statement.

                                      Scope -> (string)
                                          Specify whether you  want  to  match
                                          using  the  label  name  or just the
                                          namespace.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          The string  to  match  against.  The
                                          setting you provide for this depends
                                          on the match statement's Scope  set-
                                          ting:

                                          o If  the  Scope  indicates  LABEL ,
                                            then   this   specification   must
                                            include  the  name and can include
                                            any number of preceding  namespace
                                            specifications  and  prefix  up to
                                            providing  the   fully   qualified
                                            label name.

                                          o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE ,
                                            then   this   specification    can
                                            include  any  number of contiguous
                                            namespace strings, and can include
                                            the  entire label namespace prefix
                                            from the rule  group  or  web  ACL
                                            where the label originates.

                                          Labels are case sensitive and compo-
                                          nents of a label must  be  separated
                                          by colon, for example NS1:NS2:name .

                                   RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule  statement  used  to  search  web
                                      request components for a match against a
                                      single regular expression.

                                      RegexString -> (string)
                                          The string representing the  regular
                                          expression.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The   configuration   for   inspecting   IP
                                   addresses in an HTTP header that you  spec-
                                   ify, instead of using the IP address that's
                                   reported by the web  request  origin.  Com-
                                   monly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF)
                                   header, but  you  can  specify  any  header
                                   name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web

                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule   statement.   WAF
                                        applies   the   rule   action  to  the
                                        request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with  AND  logic.  You  provide
                               more  than  one  Statement within the AndState-
                               ment .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine with  AND  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   (structure)
                                      The processing guidance for  a   Rule  ,
                                      used  by  WAF to determine whether a web
                                      request matches the rule.

                                      ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  that  defines  a

                                          to  web  requests.  The  byte  match
                                          statement   provides  the  bytes  to
                                          search for, the location in requests
                                          that  you  want  WAF  to search, and
                                          other settings. The bytes to  search
                                          for are typically a string that cor-
                                          responds with ASCII  characters.  In
                                          the  WAF  console  and the developer
                                          guide,  this  is  refered  to  as  a
                                          string match statement.

                                          SearchString -> (blob)
                                             A  string value that you want WAF
                                             to search for. WAF searches  only
                                             in  the part of web requests that
                                             you designate for  inspection  in
                                             FieldToMatch . The maximum length
                                             of the value is 50 bytes.

                                             Valid values depend on the compo-
                                             nent that you specify for inspec-
                                             tion in FieldToMatch :

                                             o Method : The HTTP  method  that
                                               you  want  WAF  to  search for.
                                               This  indicates  the  type   of
                                               operation   specified   in  the
                                               request.

                                             o UriPath : The  value  that  you
                                               want  WAF  to search for in the
                                               URI    path,    for    example,
                                               /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                             If  SearchString  includes alpha-
                                             betic  characters  A-Z  and  a-z,
                                             note  that the value is case sen-
                                             sitive.
                                                 If you're using the WAF API

                                             Specify a base64-encoded  version
                                             of  the value. The maximum length
                                             of   the   value    before    you
                                             base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                             For example, suppose the value of
                                             Type is HEADER and the  value  of
                                             Data  is User-Agent . If you want
                                             to search the  User-Agent  header
                                             for   the   value  BadBot  ,  you
                                             base64-encode BadBot  using  MIME
                                             base64-encoding  and  include the
                                             resulting value,  QmFkQm90  ,  in
                                             the value of SearchString .
                                                 If  you're  using  the CLI or
                                                 one of the  Amazon  Web  Ser-

                                             The  value  that  you want WAF to
                                             search for. The SDK automatically
                                             base64 encodes the value.

                                          malicious  SQL  code,  create one or
                                          more SQL injection match conditions.
                                          An  SQL  injection  match  condition

                                      SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rule  statement  that  compares  a
                                          number  of bytes against the size of
                                          a request component, using a compar-
                                          ison  operator, such as greater than
                                          (>) or less than (<).  For  example,
                                          you can use a size constraint state-
                                          ment to look for query strings  that
                                          are longer than 100 bytes.

                                          If  you configure WAF to inspect the
                                          request body, WAF inspects only  the
                                          first  8192  bytes  (8  KB).  If the
                                          request body for your  web  requests
                                          never  exceeds  8192  bytes, you can
                                          create a size  constraint  condition
                                          and   block  requests  that  have  a
                                          request  body  greater   than   8192
                                          bytes.

                                          If  you  choose URI for the value of
                                          Part of the request  to  filter  on,
                                          the  slash  (/) in the URI counts as
                                          one character. For example, the  URI
                                          /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                                          FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                             The  part  of  a web request that
                                             you want WAF to inspect. For more

                                                 such  as UserName or SalesRe-
                                                 gion . The name can be up  to
                                                 30  characters long and isn't

                                          A  rule  statement  used to identify
                                          web requests  based  on  country  of
                                          origin.

                                          CountryCodes -> (list)
                                             An array of two-character country
                                             codes, for example, [ "US",  "CN"

                                          ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                             The  configuration for inspecting
                                             IP addresses in  an  HTTP  header
                                             that   you  specify,  instead  of
                                             using  the  IP   address   that's
                                             reported  by the web request ori-
                                             gin. Commonly, this is the X-For-
                                             warded-For  (XFF) header, but you
                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             HeaderName -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the HTTP header
                                                 to use for  the  IP  address.
                                                 For   example,   to  use  the
                                                 X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                                 set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header

                                             FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                                 The match status to assign to
                                                 the   web   request   if  the
                                                 request doesn't have a  valid

                                                 position.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the

                                                    request at all.

                                                 You can specify the following
                                                 fallback behaviors:

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                      RuleGroupReferenceStatement  ->  (struc-
                                      ture)
                                          A rule statement  used  to  run  the
                                          rules  that  are defined in a  Rule-
                                          Group . To use this, create  a  rule
                                          group  with your rules, then provide
                                          the ARN of the rule  group  in  this
                                          statement.

                                          You  cannot  nest  a RuleGroupRefer-
                                          enceStatement , for example for  use
                                          inside a NotStatement or OrStatement
                                          . You can only use a rule group ref-
                                          erence  statement  at  the top level
                                          inside a web ACL.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the entity.

                                          ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                             The  rules in the referenced rule
                                             group whose actions  are  set  to
                                             Count  . When you exclude a rule,
                                             WAF evaluates it  exactly  as  it
                                             would  if the rule action setting
                                             were Count .  This  is  a  useful
                                             option for testing the rules in a
                                             rule group without modifying  how
                                             they handle your web traffic.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies  a single rule in a
                                                 rule group whose  action  you
                                                 want  to  override to Count .
                                                 When you exclude a rule,  WAF
                                                 evaluates  it  exactly  as it
                                                 would if the rule action set-
                                                 ting  were  Count . This is a
                                                 useful option for testing the
                                                 rules in a rule group without
                                                 modifying  how  they   handle
                                                 your web traffic.

                                                 Name -> (string)
                                                    The name of the rule whose
                                                    action you want  to  over-
                                                    ride to Count .

                                      IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule statement used to detect web
                                          requests coming from  particular  IP
                                          addresses  or address ranges. To use
                                          this, create an  IPSet  that  speci-
                                          fies   the  addresses  you  want  to
                                          detect, then use the ARN of that set
                                          in  this  statement. To create an IP
                                          set, see  CreateIPSet .

                                          Each IP set  rule  statement  refer-
                                          ences  an  IP  set.  You  create and
                                          maintain the set independent of your
                                          rules.  This  allows  you to use the
                                          single set in multiple  rules.  When
                                          you  update  the referenced set, WAF
                                          automatically updates all rules that
                                          reference it.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the  IPSet  that  this  statement
                                             references.

                                          IPSetForwardedIPConfig   ->  (struc-
                                          ture)
                                             The configuration for  inspecting
                                             IP  addresses  in  an HTTP header
                                             that  you  specify,  instead   of
                                             using   the   IP  address  that's
                                             reported by the web request  ori-
                                             gin. Commonly, this is the X-For-
                                             warded-For (XFF) header, but  you
                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             HeaderName -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  HTTP  header
                                                 to  use  for  the IP address.
                                                 For  example,  to   use   the
                                                 X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                                 set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                                                 NOTE:

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header

                                                 You can specify the following
                                                 fallback behaviors:

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web
                                                   request   as  matching  the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                             Position -> (string)
                                                 The position in the header to
                                                 search  for  the  IP address.
                                                 The  header  can  contain  IP
                                                 addresses   of  the  original
                                                 client and also  of  proxies.
                                                 For example, the header value
                                                 could be 10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0,
                                                 10.10.10.10  where  the first
                                                 IP  address  identifies   the
                                                 original  client and the rest
                                                 identify  proxies  that   the
                                                 request went through.

                                                 The  options for this setting
                                                 are the following:

                                                 o FIRST - Inspect  the  first
                                                   IP  address  in the list of
                                                   IP addresses in the header.
                                                   This    is    usually   the
                                                   client's original IP.

                                                 o LAST - Inspect the last  IP
                                                   address  in  the list of IP
                                                   addresses in the header.

                                                 o ANY  -   Inspect   all   IP
                                                   addresses in the header for
                                                   a match. If the header con-
                                                   tains   more   than  10  IP
                                                   addresses, WAF inspects the
                                                   last 10.

                                      RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement     ->
                                      (structure)
                                          A rule statement used to search  web
                                          request  components for matches with
                                          regular expressions.  To  use  this,
                                          create a  RegexPatternSet that spec-
                                          ifies the expressions that you  want
                                          to  detect, then use the ARN of that
                                          set in this statement. A web request
                                          matches  the pattern set rule state-
                                          ment  if   the   request   component
                                          matches  any  of the patterns in the
                                          set. To create a regex pattern  set,
                                          see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                          Each  regex  pattern set rule state-
                                          ment references a regex pattern set.
                                          You  create  and  maintain  the  set
                                          independent  of  your  rules.   This
                                          allows  you to use the single set in
                                          multiple rules. When you update  the
                                          referenced  set,  WAF  automatically
                                          updates all rules that reference it.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the   RegexPatternSet  that  this
                                             statement references.

                                          FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                             The  part  of  a web request that
                                             you want WAF to inspect. For more

                                                 to  inspect,   for   example,
                                                 User-Agent  or Referer . This
                                                 setting isn't case sensitive.

                                      RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rate-based rule tracks the rate of
                                          requests  for  each  originating  IP
                                          address,   and   triggers  the  rule
                                          action when the rate exceeds a limit
                                          that  you  specify  on the number of
                                          requests in any 5-minute time  span.
                                          You  can use this to put a temporary
                                          block on requests from an IP address
                                          that  is sending excessive requests.

                                          WAF tracks and manages web  requests
                                          separately  for  each  instance of a
                                          rate-based rule that  you  use.  For
                                          example,  if  you  provide  the same
                                          rate-based rule settings in two  web
                                          ACLs,  each  of  the two rule state-
                                          ments represents a separate instance
                                          of  the rate-based rule and gets its
                                          own tracking and management by  WAF.
                                          If  you  define  a  rate-based  rule
                                          inside a rule group,  and  then  use
                                          that  rule group in multiple places,
                                          each use creates a separate instance
                                          of the rate-based rule that gets its
                                          own tracking and management by  WAF.

                                          When  the  rule action triggers, WAF
                                          blocks additional requests from  the
                                          IP  address  until  the request rate
                                          falls below the limit.

                                          You  can  optionally  nest   another
                                          statement   inside   the  rate-based
                                          statement, to narrow  the  scope  of
                                          the  rule  so  that  it  only counts
                                          requests  that  match   the   nested
                                          statement.  For  example,  based  on
                                          recent requests that you  have  seen
                                          from an attacker, you might create a
                                          rate-based rule with  a  nested  AND
                                          rule  statement  that  contains  the
                                          following nested statements:

                                          o An IP match statement with  an  IP
                                            set  that  specified  the  address
                                            192.0.2.44.

                                          o A  string  match  statement   that
                                            searches  in the User-Agent header
                                            for the string BadBot.

                                          In this rate-based  rule,  you  also
                                          define  a rate limit. For this exam-
                                          ple,  the  rate  limit   is   1,000.
                                          Requests  that meet both of the con-
                                          ditions  in   the   statements   are
                                          counted.  If the count exceeds 1,000
                                          requests per five minutes, the  rule
                                          action  triggers.  Requests  that do
                                          not meet  both  conditions  are  not
                                          counted  towards  the rate limit and
                                          are not affected by this rule.

                                          You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement
                                          inside  another statement, for exam-
                                          ple   inside   a   NotStatement   or
                                          OrStatement . You can define a Rate-
                                          BasedStatement inside a web ACL  and
                                          inside a rule group.

                                          Limit -> (long)
                                             The   limit   on   requests   per
                                             5-minute  period  for  a   single
                                             originating  IP  address.  If the
                                             statement includes  a  ScopeDown-
                                             Statement , this limit is applied
                                             only to the requests  that  match
                                             the statement.

                                          AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                             Setting  that  indicates  how  to
                                             aggregate the request counts. The
                                             options are the following:

                                             o IP   -  Aggregate  the  request
                                               counts on the IP  address  from
                                               the web request origin.

                                             o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the
                                               request counts on the first  IP
                                               address  in  an HTTP header. If
                                               you  use  this,  configure  the
                                               ForwardedIPConfig  , to specify
                                               the header to use.

                                          fig -> (structure)
                                             The  configuration for inspecting
                                             IP addresses in  an  HTTP  header
                                             that   you  specify,  instead  of
                                             using  the  IP   address   that's
                                             reported  by the web request ori-
                                             gin. Commonly, this is the X-For-
                                             warded-For  (XFF) header, but you
                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             This is required if AggregateKey-
                                             Type is set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                             HeaderName -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  HTTP  header
                                                 to  use  for  the IP address.
                                                 For  example,  to   use   the
                                                 X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                                 set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the
                                                    request, WAF doesn't apply
                                                    the  rule   to   the   web
                                                    request at all.

                                             FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                                 The match status to assign to
                                                 the  web   request   if   the
                                                 request  doesn't have a valid
                                                 IP address in  the  specified
                                                 position.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header

                                                    request, WAF doesn't apply
                                                    the  rule   to   the   web
                                                    request at all.

                                                 You can specify the following
                                                 fallback behaviors:

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web
                                                   request   as  matching  the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the

                                      AndStatement -> (structure)
                                          A logical  rule  statement  used  to
                                          combine  other  rule statements with
                                          AND logic. You provide more than one

                                          Statements -> (list)
                                             The statements  to  combine  with
                                             AND logic. You can use any state-
                                             ments that can be nested.

                                      OrStatement -> (structure)
                                          A logical  rule  statement  used  to
                                          combine  other  rule statements with
                                          OR logic. You provide more than  one
                                          Statement within the OrStatement .

                                          Statements -> (list)
                                             The statements to combine with OR
                                             logic. You can use any statements
                                             that can be nested.

                                      NotStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  logical  rule  statement  used to
                                          negate the results of  another  rule
                                          statement.  You  provide one  State-

                                      ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  used  to run the
                                          rules that are defined in a  managed
                                          rule group. To use this, provide the
                                          vendor name and the name of the rule
                                          group  in  this  statement.  You can
                                          retrieve the required names by call-
                                          ing   ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups
                                          .

                                          You cannot nest a  ManagedRuleGroup-
                                          Statement  ,  for  example  for  use
                                          inside a NotStatement or OrStatement
                                          .  It  can  only  be referenced as a
                                          top-level statement within a rule.

                                          VendorName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the  managed  rule
                                             group vendor. You use this, along
                                             with  the  rule  group  name,  to
                                             identify the rule group.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the  managed  rule
                                             group. You use this,  along  with
                                             the  vendor name, to identify the
                                             rule group.

                                          Version -> (string)
                                             The version of the  managed  rule
                                             group  to  use.  If  you  specify
                                             this,  the  version  setting   is
                                             fixed until you change it. If you
                                             don't specify this, WAF uses  the
                                             vendor's   default  version,  and
                                             then keeps  the  version  at  the
                                             vendor's  default when the vendor
                                             updates the  managed  rule  group
                                             settings.

                                          ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                             The  rules in the referenced rule
                                             group whose actions  are  set  to
                                             Count  . When you exclude a rule,
                                             WAF evaluates it  exactly  as  it
                                             would  if the rule action setting
                                             were Count .  This  is  a  useful
                                             option for testing the rules in a
                                             rule group without modifying  how
                                             they handle your web traffic.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies  a single rule in a
                                                 rule group whose  action  you
                                                 want  to  override to Count .
                                                 When you exclude a rule,  WAF
                                                 evaluates  it  exactly  as it
                                                 would if the rule action set-
                                                 ting  were  Count . This is a
                                                 useful option for testing the
                                                 rules in a rule group without
                                                 modifying  how  they   handle
                                                 your web traffic.

                                                 Name -> (string)
                                                    The name of the rule whose
                                                    action you want  to  over-

                                      LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  that  defines  a
                                          string match search  against  labels
                                          that  have  been  added  to  the web
                                          request by rules that  have  already
                                          run in the web ACL.

                                          The  label  match statement provides
                                          the label  or  namespace  string  to
                                          search  for.  The  label  string can
                                          represent a part or all of the fully
                                          qualified  label  name that had been
                                          added  to  the  web  request.  Fully
                                          qualified   labels  have  a  prefix,
                                          optional namespaces, and label name.
                                          The prefix identifies the rule group
                                          or web ACL context of the rule  that
                                          added  the label. If you do not pro-
                                          vide the  fully  qualified  name  in
                                          your  label  match  string, WAF per-
                                          forms the  search  for  labels  that
                                          were  added  in  the same context as
                                          the label match statement.

                                          Scope -> (string)
                                             Specify whether you want to match
                                             using  the label name or just the
                                             namespace.

                                          Key -> (string)
                                             The string to match against.  The
                                             setting   you  provide  for  this
                                             depends on the match  statement's
                                             Scope setting:

                                             o If  the Scope indicates LABEL ,
                                               then  this  specification  must
                                               include   the   name   and  can
                                               include any number of preceding
                                               namespace   specifications  and
                                               prefix  up  to  providing   the
                                               fully qualified label name.

                                             o If  the  Scope indicates NAMES-
                                               PACE , then this  specification
                                               can  include any number of con-
                                               tiguous namespace strings,  and
                                               can  include  the  entire label
                                               namespace prefix from the  rule
                                               group  or  web  ACL  where  the
                                               label originates.

                                             Labels  are  case  sensitive  and
                                             components  of  a  label  must be
                                             separated by colon,  for  example
                                             NS1:NS2:name .

                                      RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule statement used to search web

                                          FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                             The  part  of  a web request that
                                             you want WAF to inspect. For more

                                      ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  that  defines  a

                                          to  web  requests.  The  byte  match
                                          statement  provides  the  bytes   to
                                          search for, the location in requests

                                          SearchString -> (blob)
                                             A string value that you want  WAF
                                             to  search for. WAF searches only
                                             in the part of web requests  that
                                             you  designate  for inspection in
                                             FieldToMatch . The maximum length
                                             of the value is 50 bytes.

                                             Valid values depend on the compo-

                                               This   indicates  the  type  of
                                               operation  specified   in   the

                                               /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                             If SearchString  includes  alpha-
                                             betic  characters  A-Z  and  a-z,

                                             For example, suppose the value of
                                             Type  is  HEADER and the value of
                                             Data is User-Agent . If you  want
                                             to  search  the User-Agent header
                                             for  the  value  BadBot   ,   you

                                      SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  rule  statement  that  compares a
                                          number of bytes against the size  of
                                          a request component, using a compar-
                                          ison operator, such as greater  than
                                          (>)  or  less than (<). For example,
                                          you can use a size constraint state-
                                          ment  to look for query strings that
                                          are longer than 100 bytes.

                                          If you configure WAF to inspect  the
                                          request  body, WAF inspects only the
                                          first 8192  bytes  (8  KB).  If  the
                                          request  body  for your web requests
                                          never exceeds 8192  bytes,  you  can
                                          create  a  size constraint condition
                                          and  block  requests  that  have   a
                                          request   body   greater  than  8192
                                          bytes.

                                          If you choose URI for the  value  of
                                          Part  of  the  request to filter on,
                                          the slash (/) in the URI  counts  as
                                          one  character. For example, the URI
                                          /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                                             were  Count  .  This  is a useful
                                             option for testing the rules in a
                                             rule  group without modifying how
                                             they handle your web traffic.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies a single rule in  a
                                                 rule  group  whose action you
                                                 want to override to  Count  .
                                                 When  you exclude a rule, WAF
                                                 evaluates it  exactly  as  it
                                                 would if the rule action set-
                                                 ting were Count . This  is  a
                                                 useful option for testing the
                                                 rules in a rule group without
                                                 modifying   how  they  handle
                                                 your web traffic.

                                                 Name -> (string)
                                                    The name of the rule whose
                                                    action  you  want to over-
                                                    ride to Count .

                                      IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rule statement used to detect  web
                                          requests  coming  from particular IP
                                          addresses or address ranges. To  use
                                          this,  create  an  IPSet that speci-
                                          fies  the  addresses  you  want   to
                                          detect, then use the ARN of that set
                                          in this statement. To create  an  IP
                                          set, see  CreateIPSet .

                                          Each  IP  set  rule statement refer-
                                          ences an  IP  set.  You  create  and
                                          maintain the set independent of your
                                          rules. This allows you  to  use  the
                                          single  set  in multiple rules. When
                                          you update the referenced  set,  WAF
                                          automatically updates all rules that
                                          reference it.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the   IPSet  that  this statement
                                             references.

                                          IPSetForwardedIPConfig  ->   (struc-
                                          ture)
                                             The  configuration for inspecting
                                             IP addresses in  an  HTTP  header
                                             that   you  specify,  instead  of
                                             using  the  IP   address   that's
                                             reported  by the web request ori-
                                             gin. Commonly, this is the X-For-
                                             warded-For  (XFF) header, but you
                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             HeaderName -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the HTTP header
                                                 to use for  the  IP  address.
                                                 For   example,   to  use  the
                                                 X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                                 set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the
                                                    request, WAF doesn't apply

                                                    request at all.

                                             FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                                 The match status to assign to
                                                 the   web   request   if  the
                                                 request doesn't have a  valid
                                                 IP  address  in the specified
                                                 position.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    If  the  specified  header
                                                    isn't   present   in   the
                                                    request, WAF doesn't apply
                                                    the   rule   to   the  web
                                                    request at all.

                                                 You can specify the following
                                                 fallback behaviors:

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                             Position -> (string)
                                                 The position in the header to
                                                 search for  the  IP  address.
                                                 The  header  can  contain  IP
                                                 addresses  of  the   original
                                                 client  and  also of proxies.
                                                 For example, the header value
                                                 could be 10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0,
                                                 10.10.10.10 where  the  first
                                                 IP   address  identifies  the
                                                 original client and the  rest
                                                 identify   proxies  that  the
                                                 request went through.

                                                 The options for this  setting
                                                 are the following:

                                                 o FIRST  -  Inspect the first
                                                   IP address in the  list  of
                                                   IP addresses in the header.
                                                   This   is    usually    the
                                                   client's original IP.

                                                 o LAST  - Inspect the last IP
                                                   address in the list  of  IP
                                                   addresses in the header.

                                                 o ANY   -   Inspect   all  IP
                                                   addresses in the header for
                                                   a match. If the header con-
                                                   tains  more  than   10   IP
                                                   addresses, WAF inspects the
                                                   last 10.

                                      RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement     ->
                                      (structure)
                                          A  rule statement used to search web
                                          request components for matches  with
                                          regular  expressions.  To  use this,
                                          create a  RegexPatternSet that spec-
                                          ifies  the expressions that you want
                                          to detect, then use the ARN of  that
                                          set in this statement. A web request
                                          matches the pattern set rule  state-
                                          ment   if   the   request  component
                                          matches any of the patterns  in  the
                                          set.  To create a regex pattern set,
                                          see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                          Each regex pattern set  rule  state-
                                          ment references a regex pattern set.
                                          You  create  and  maintain  the  set
                                          independent   of  your  rules.  This
                                          allows you to use the single set  in
                                          multiple  rules. When you update the
                                          referenced  set,  WAF  automatically
                                          updates all rules that reference it.

                                          ARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of

                                      RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rate-based rule tracks the rate of
                                          requests  for  each  originating  IP
                                          address,  and  triggers   the   rule
                                          action when the rate exceeds a limit
                                          that you specify on  the  number  of
                                          requests  in any 5-minute time span.
                                          You can use this to put a  temporary
                                          block on requests from an IP address
                                          that is sending excessive  requests.

                                          WAF  tracks and manages web requests
                                          separately for each  instance  of  a
                                          rate-based  rule  that  you use. For
                                          example, if  you  provide  the  same
                                          rate-based  rule settings in two web
                                          ACLs, each of the  two  rule  state-
                                          ments represents a separate instance
                                          of the rate-based rule and gets  its
                                          own  tracking and management by WAF.
                                          If  you  define  a  rate-based  rule
                                          inside  a  rule  group, and then use
                                          that rule group in multiple  places,
                                          each use creates a separate instance
                                          of the rate-based rule that gets its
                                          own  tracking and management by WAF.

                                          When the rule action  triggers,  WAF
                                          blocks  additional requests from the
                                          IP address until  the  request  rate
                                          falls below the limit.

                                          You   can  optionally  nest  another
                                          statement  inside   the   rate-based
                                          statement,  to  narrow  the scope of
                                          the rule  so  that  it  only  counts
                                          requests   that   match  the  nested
                                          statement.  For  example,  based  on
                                          recent  requests  that you have seen
                                          from an attacker, you might create a
                                          rate-based  rule  with  a nested AND
                                          rule  statement  that  contains  the
                                          following nested statements:

                                          o An  IP  match statement with an IP
                                            set  that  specified  the  address
                                            192.0.2.44.

                                          o A   string  match  statement  that
                                            searches in the User-Agent  header
                                            for the string BadBot.

                                          In  this  rate-based  rule, you also
                                          define a rate limit. For this  exam-
                                          ple,   the   rate  limit  is  1,000.
                                          Requests that meet both of the  con-
                                          ditions   in   the   statements  are
                                          counted. If the count exceeds  1,000
                                          requests  per five minutes, the rule
                                          action triggers.  Requests  that  do
                                          not  meet  both  conditions  are not
                                          counted towards the rate  limit  and
                                          are not affected by this rule.

                                          You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement
                                          inside another statement, for  exam-
                                          ple   inside   a   NotStatement   or
                                          OrStatement . You can define a Rate-
                                          BasedStatement  inside a web ACL and
                                          inside a rule group.

                                          Limit -> (long)
                                             The   limit   on   requests   per
                                             5-minute   period  for  a  single
                                             originating IP  address.  If  the
                                             statement  includes  a ScopeDown-
                                             Statement , this limit is applied
                                             only  to  the requests that match
                                             the statement.

                                          AggregateKeyType -> (string)

                                             that  you  specify,  instead   of
                                             using   the   IP  address  that's

                                             can specify any header name.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't

                                      OrStatement -> (structure)
                                          A  logical  rule  statement  used to
                                          combine other rule  statements  with

                                          Statements -> (list)
                                             The statements to combine with OR
                                             logic. You can use any statements
                                             that can be nested.

                                          A logical  rule  statement  used  to
                                          negate  the  results of another rule
                                          statement. You provide  one   State-

                                      ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rule statement  used  to  run  the
                                          rules  that are defined in a managed
                                          rule group. To use this, provide the
                                          vendor name and the name of the rule
                                          group in  this  statement.  You  can
                                          retrieve the required names by call-

                                          You  cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroup-
                                          Statement  ,  for  example  for  use
                                          inside a NotStatement or OrStatement
                                          . It can only  be  referenced  as  a
                                          top-level statement within a rule.

                                          VendorName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the  managed  rule
                                             group vendor. You use this, along
                                             with  the  rule  group  name,  to
                                             identify the rule group.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the  managed  rule
                                             group.  You  use this, along with
                                             the vendor name, to identify  the
                                             rule group.

                                          Version -> (string)
                                             The  version  of the managed rule
                                             group  to  use.  If  you  specify
                                             this,   the  version  setting  is
                                             fixed until you change it. If you
                                             don't  specify this, WAF uses the
                                             vendor's  default  version,   and
                                             then  keeps  the  version  at the
                                             vendor's default when the  vendor
                                             updates  the  managed  rule group
                                             settings.

                                          ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                             The rules in the referenced  rule
                                             group  whose  actions  are set to
                                             Count . When you exclude a  rule,
                                             WAF  evaluates  it  exactly as it
                                             would if the rule action  setting
                                             were  Count  .  This  is a useful
                                             option for testing the rules in a
                                             rule  group without modifying how
                                             they handle your web traffic.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies a single rule in  a
                                                 rule  group  whose action you
                                                 want to override to  Count  .
                                                 When  you exclude a rule, WAF
                                                 evaluates it  exactly  as  it
                                                 would if the rule action set-
                                                 ting were Count . This  is  a
                                                 useful option for testing the
                                                 rules in a rule group without
                                                 modifying   how  they  handle
                                                 your web traffic.

                                                 Name -> (string)
                                                    The name of the rule whose
                                                    action  you  want to over-

                                          The label match  statement  provides
                                          the  label  or  namespace  string to
                                          search for.  The  label  string  can
                                          represent a part or all of the fully
                                          qualified label name that  had  been
                                          added  to  the  web  request.  Fully
                                          qualified  labels  have  a   prefix,
                                          optional namespaces, and label name.
                                          The prefix identifies the rule group
                                          or  web ACL context of the rule that
                                          added the label. If you do not  pro-
                                          vide  the  fully  qualified  name in
                                          your label match  string,  WAF  per-
                                          forms  the  search  for  labels that
                                          were added in the  same  context  as
                                          the label match statement.

                                          Scope -> (string)
                                             Specify whether you want to match
                                             using the label name or just  the
                                             namespace.

                                          Key -> (string)
                                             The  string to match against. The
                                             setting  you  provide  for   this
                                             depends  on the match statement's
                                             Scope setting:

                                             o If the Scope indicates LABEL  ,
                                               then  this  specification  must
                                               include  the   name   and   can
                                               include any number of preceding
                                               namespace  specifications   and
                                               prefix   up  to  providing  the
                                               fully qualified label name.

                                             o If the Scope  indicates  NAMES-
                                               PACE  , then this specification
                                               can include any number of  con-
                                               tiguous  namespace strings, and
                                               can include  the  entire  label
                                               namespace  prefix from the rule
                                               group  or  web  ACL  where  the
                                               label originates.

                                             Labels  are  case  sensitive  and
                                             components of  a  label  must  be
                                             separated  by  colon, for example
                                             NS1:NS2:name .

                                      RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                          A rule statement used to search  web
                                          request   components   for  a  match
                                          against a single regular expression.

                                          RegexString -> (string)
                                             The string representing the regu-
                                             lar expression.

                                          FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                             The part of a  web  request  that
                                             you want WAF to inspect. For more

                                             SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                                 Inspect a single header. Pro-
                                                 vide the name of  the  header
                                                 to   inspect,   for  example,
                                                 User-Agent or Referer .  This
                                                 setting isn't case sensitive.

                                                 Example JSON: "SingleHeader":

                                                 Inspect  a single query argu-
                                                 ment. Provide the name of the
                                                 query  argument  to  inspect,
                                                 such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                                                 gion  . The name can be up to
                                                 30 characters long and  isn't
                                                 case sensitive.

                                                 This is used only to indicate

                                             Body -> (structure)
                                                 Inspect  the  request body as
                                                 plain text. The request  body
                                                 immediately    follows    the
                                                 request headers. This is  the

                                                 from a form.

                                                 Note that only the first 8 KB
                                                 (8192  bytes)  of the request
                                                 body are forwarded to WAF for

                                            for  example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                            .

                                          If SearchString includes  alphabetic
                                          characters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that
                                          the value is case sensitive.
                                             If you're using the WAF API

                                          Specify a base64-encoded version  of
                                          the value. The maximum length of the
                                          value before you base64-encode it is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          For  example,  suppose  the value of
                                          Type is HEADER and the value of Data
                                          is  User-Agent  .  If  you  want  to
                                          search the User-Agent header for the
                                          value  BadBot  ,  you  base64-encode
                                          BadBot  using  MIME  base64-encoding
                                          and  include  the  resulting  value,
                                          QmFkQm90 , in the value  of  Search-
                                          String .
                                             If you're using the CLI or one of
                                             the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                          The  value  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                          search  for.  The  SDK automatically
                                          base64 encodes the value.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-
                                             ers.  This  is  the  part  of   a
                                             request  that  contains any addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to  your  web  server as the HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body

                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect   the  HTTP  method.  The
                                             method  indicates  the  type   of

                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -
                                                   Inspect  the  body as plain
                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:
                                                   {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                                             Text   transformations  eliminate
                                             some of  the  unusual  formatting

                                          SearchString   ,  but  the  location
                                          doesn't matter.

                                   SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      Attackers sometimes insert malicious SQL
                                      code  into  web requests in an effort to
                                      extract  data  from  your  database.  To
                                      allow  or block web requests that appear
                                      to contain malicious  SQL  code,  create
                                      one  or  more SQL injection match condi-
                                      tions. An SQL injection match  condition
                                      identifies  the  part  of  web requests,
                                      such as the URI  or  the  query  string,
                                      that  you  want WAF to inspect. Later in
                                      the process, when you create a web  ACL,
                                      you  specify  whether  to allow or block
                                      requests that appear  to  contain  mali-
                                      cious SQL code.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-
                                             ers.   This  is  the  part  of  a
                                             request that contains  any  addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to your web server  as  the  HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note that only  the  first  8  KB
                                             (8192  bytes) of the request body
                                             are forwarded to WAF for  inspec-

                                             vice.  If  you  don't   need   to
                                             inspect  more  than 8 KB, you can
                                             guarantee that  you  don't  allow
                                             additional  bytes in by combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body  of the web request, such as
                                             ByteMatchStatement or   RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement  , with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces  an  8  KB size limit on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire contents of  web  requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  HTTP  method.   The
                                             method   indicates  the  type  of
                                             operation  that  the  request  is
                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.
                                             The request body immediately fol-
                                             lows the request headers. This is
                                             the part of a request  that  con-
                                             tains  any  additional  data that
                                             you want  to  send  to  your  web

                                             such as data from a form.

                                             Note that only  the  first  8  KB
                                             (8192  bytes) of the request body
                                             are forwarded to WAF for  inspec-

                                             inspect  more  than 8 KB, you can
                                             guarantee that  you  don't  allow
                                             additional  bytes in by combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the

                                             ByteMatchStatement or   RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement  , with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces  an  8  KB size limit on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire contents of  web  requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON body.  The  options  are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -

                                                   text.  WAF applies the text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion   criteria   that  you
                                                   defined   for   the    JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web
                                                   request   as  matching  the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the
                                                 following  examples  as   two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.  If  you
                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                             Text  transformations   eliminate
                                             some  of  the  unusual formatting
                                             that   attackers   use   in   web

                                      for  WAF  to  apply to web requests. XSS
                                      attacks are  those  where  the  attacker
                                      uses vulnerabilities in a benign website
                                      as  a  vehicle   to   inject   malicious
                                      client-site  scripts  into other legiti-

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain

                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body

                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body of the web request, such  as
                                             ByteMatchStatement  or  RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that

                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the

                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect   the  HTTP  method.  The
                                             method  indicates  the  type   of

                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.
                                             The request body immediately fol-
                                             lows the request headers. This is
                                             the  part  of a request that con-

                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the

                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of web requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -
                                                   Inspect  the  body as plain
                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                                             Text   transformations  eliminate
                                             some of  the  unusual  formatting
                                             that   attackers   use   in   web

                                   SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement that compares a  number
                                      of  bytes  against the size of a request
                                      component, using a comparison  operator,
                                      such  as  greater  than (>) or less than
                                      (<). For example, you  can  use  a  size
                                      constraint  statement  to look for query
                                      strings that are longer than 100  bytes.

                                      If  you  configure  WAF  to  inspect the
                                      request  body,  WAF  inspects  only  the
                                      first  8192 bytes (8 KB). If the request
                                      body for your web requests never exceeds
                                      8192  bytes,  you can create a size con-
                                      straint  condition  and  block  requests
                                      that  have  a  request body greater than
                                      8192 bytes.

                                      If you choose URI for the value of  Part
                                      of  the  request to filter on, the slash
                                      (/) in the URI counts as one  character.
                                      For  example,  the URI /logo.jpg is nine
                                      characters long.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-
                                             ers.  This  is  the  part  of   a
                                             request  that  contains any addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to  your  web  server as the HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body
                                             are  forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                             tion by the underlying host  ser-
                                             vice.   If   you  don't  need  to
                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body of the web request, such  as
                                             ByteMatchStatement  or  RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces an 8 KB  size  limit  on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of web requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect   the  HTTP  method.  The
                                             method  indicates  the  type   of
                                             operation  that  the  request  is
                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.
                                             The request body immediately fol-
                                             lows the request headers. This is
                                             the  part  of a request that con-
                                             tains any  additional  data  that
                                             you  want  to  send  to  your web
                                             server as the HTTP request  body,
                                             such as data from a form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body
                                             are  forwarded to WAF for inspec-

                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body of the web request, such  as
                                             ByteMatchStatement  or  RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces an 8 KB  size  limit  on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of web requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                                    not both.

                                                 IncludedPaths -> (list)

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -
                                                   Inspect  the  body as plain
                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:

                                      ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                          The operator to use to  compare  the
                                          request part to the size setting.

                                      Size -> (long)
                                          The size, in byte, to compare to the
                                          request part, after any  transforma-
                                          tions.

                                      TextTransformations -> (list)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.  If  you
                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                          (structure)
                                             Text  transformations   eliminate

                                      ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                          The configuration for inspecting  IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify, instead  of  using  the  IP
                                          address  that's  reported by the web
                                          request origin.  Commonly,  this  is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't

                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF)  header, set this to X-For-

                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                   RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement used to run the rules
                                      that are defined in a   RuleGroup  .  To
                                      use  this, create a rule group with your
                                      rules, then provide the ARN of the  rule
                                      group in this statement.

                                      You  cannot  nest a RuleGroupReferenceS-
                                      tatement , for example for use inside  a
                                      NotStatement  or  OrStatement  . You can
                                      only use a rule group  reference  state-
                                      ment  at the top level inside a web ACL.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of
                                          the entity.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The  rules  in  the  referenced rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates it exactly as it would if  the
                                          rule  action  setting  were  Count .
                                          This is a useful option for  testing
                                          the  rules  in  a rule group without
                                          modifying how they handle  your  web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group whose action  you  want  to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude a rule, WAF evaluates  it
                                             exactly  as  it would if the rule
                                             action setting were Count .  This
                                             is  a  useful  option for testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying  how  they  handle your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)

                                   IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule  statement  used  to  detect  web
                                      requests   coming   from  particular  IP
                                      addresses  or  address  ranges.  To  use
                                      this,  create  an   IPSet that specifies
                                      the addresses you want to  detect,  then
                                      use  the  ARN of that set in this state-
                                      ment. To create an  IP  set,  see   Cre-
                                      ateIPSet .

                                      Each IP set rule statement references an
                                      IP set. You create and maintain the  set
                                      independent  of  your rules. This allows
                                      you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                                      rules.  When  you  update the referenced
                                      set, WAF automatically updates all rules
                                      that reference it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of
                                          the  IPSet that this statement  ref-
                                          erences.

                                      IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                          The  configuration for inspecting IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify,  instead  of  using  the IP
                                          address that's reported by  the  web
                                          request  origin.  Commonly,  this is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the HTTP header to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF) header, set this to  X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a valid  IP  address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                          Position -> (string)
                                             The position  in  the  header  to
                                             search  for  the  IP address. The
                                             header can contain  IP  addresses
                                             of  the  original client and also
                                             of  proxies.  For  example,   the
                                             header  value  could be 10.1.1.1,
                                             127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10 where  the
                                             first  IP  address identifies the
                                             original  client  and  the   rest
                                             identify proxies that the request
                                             went through.

                                             The options for this setting  are
                                             the following:

                                             o FIRST  -  Inspect  the first IP
                                               address  in  the  list  of   IP
                                               addresses  in  the header. This
                                               is usually the client's  origi-
                                               nal IP.

                                             o LAST  -  Inspect  the  last  IP
                                               address  in  the  list  of   IP
                                               addresses in the header.

                                             o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses
                                               in the header for a  match.  If
                                               the  header  contains more than
                                               10 IP addresses,  WAF  inspects
                                               the last 10.

                                   RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement        ->
                                   (structure)
                                      A rule  statement  used  to  search  web
                                      request components for matches with reg-
                                      ular expressions. To use this, create  a
                                      RegexPatternSet   that   specifies   the
                                      expressions that  you  want  to  detect,
                                      then  use  the  ARN  of that set in this
                                      statement. A  web  request  matches  the
                                      pattern   set   rule  statement  if  the
                                      request component  matches  any  of  the
                                      patterns  in  the set. To create a regex
                                      pattern set, see   CreateRegexPatternSet
                                      .

                                      Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement
                                      references a regex pattern set. You cre-
                                      ate  and maintain the set independent of
                                      your rules. This allows you to  use  the
                                      single  set  in multiple rules. When you
                                      update the referenced set, WAF automati-
                                      cally  updates  all rules that reference
                                      it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of
                                          the    RegexPatternSet   that   this
                                          statement references.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears

                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow

                                   RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rate-based rule  tracks  the  rate  of
                                      requests   for   each   originating   IP
                                      address, and triggers  the  rule  action
                                      when  the  rate exceeds a limit that you
                                      specify on the number of requests in any
                                      5-minute  time span. You can use this to
                                      put a temporary block on  requests  from
                                      an  IP address that is sending excessive
                                      requests.

                                      WAF tracks and manages web requests sep-
                                      arately   for   each   instance   of   a
                                      rate-based rule that you use. For  exam-
                                      ple,  if you provide the same rate-based
                                      rule settings in two web ACLs,  each  of
                                      the  two  rule  statements  represents a
                                      separate instance of the rate-based rule
                                      and gets its own tracking and management
                                      by WAF. If you define a rate-based  rule
                                      inside  a  rule group, and then use that
                                      rule group in multiple places, each  use
                                      creates   a  separate  instance  of  the
                                      rate-based rule that gets its own track-
                                      ing and management by WAF.

                                      When   the  rule  action  triggers,  WAF
                                      blocks additional requests from  the  IP
                                      address  until  the  request  rate falls
                                      below the limit.

                                      You can optionally nest  another  state-
                                      ment inside the rate-based statement, to
                                      narrow the scope of the rule so that  it
                                      only  counts  requests  that  match  the
                                      nested statement. For example, based  on
                                      recent  requests that you have seen from
                                      an  attacker,   you   might   create   a
                                      rate-based  rule  with a nested AND rule
                                      statement that  contains  the  following
                                      nested statements:

                                      o An  IP  match statement with an IP set
                                        that specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                      o A string match statement that searches
                                        in  the  User-Agent  header  for   the
                                        string BadBot.

                                      In this rate-based rule, you also define
                                      a rate limit. For this example, the rate
                                      limit  is 1,000. Requests that meet both
                                      of the conditions in the statements  are
                                      counted.  If  the  count  exceeds  1,000
                                      requests  per  five  minutes,  the  rule
                                      action  triggers.  Requests  that do not
                                      meet both  conditions  are  not  counted
                                      towards  the  rate  limit  and  are  not
                                      affected by this rule.

                                      You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement
                                      inside  another  statement,  for example
                                      inside a NotStatement or  OrStatement  .
                                      You   can  define  a  RateBasedStatement
                                      inside a  web  ACL  and  inside  a  rule
                                      group.

                                      Limit -> (long)
                                          The  limit  on requests per 5-minute
                                          period for a single  originating  IP

                                          ScopeDownStatement , this  limit  is
                                          applied  only  to  the requests that
                                          match the statement.

                                          Setting that indicates how to aggre-
                                          gate the request counts. The options
                                          are the following:

                                          o IP - Aggregate the request  counts
                                            on  the  IP  address  from the web
                                            request origin.

                                          o FORWARDED_IP   -   Aggregate   the
                                            request  counts  on  the  first IP
                                            address in an HTTP header. If  you
                                            use   this,   configure  the  For-
                                            wardedIPConfig ,  to  specify  the
                                            header to use.

                                      (  ...  recursive ... )ForwardedIPConfig
                                      -> (structure)
                                          The configuration for inspecting  IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify, instead  of  using  the  IP
                                          address  that's  reported by the web
                                          request origin.  Commonly,  this  is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF

                                             request at all.

                                          This is required if AggregateKeyType
                                          is set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the HTTP header to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF) header, set this to  X-For-

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a valid  IP  address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                   AndStatement -> (structure)
                                      A logical rule statement used to combine
                                      other  rule  statements  with AND logic.
                                      You provide  more  than  one   Statement
                                      within the AndStatement .

                                      Statements -> (list)
                                          The  statements  to combine with AND
                                          logic. You can  use  any  statements
                                          that can be nested.

                                          ( ... recursive ... )

                                   OrStatement -> (structure)
                                      A logical rule statement used to combine
                                      other rule statements with OR logic. You
                                      provide  more than one  Statement within
                                      the OrStatement .

                                      Statements -> (list)
                                          The statements to  combine  with  OR
                                          logic.  You  can  use any statements
                                          that can be nested.

                                          ( ... recursive ... )

                                   NotStatement -> (structure)
                                      A logical rule statement used to  negate
                                      the  results  of another rule statement.
                                      You provide one   Statement  within  the
                                      NotStatement .

                                      ( ... recursive ... )

                                   ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement used to run the rules
                                      that  are  defined  in  a  managed  rule
                                      group.  To  use this, provide the vendor
                                      name and the name of the rule  group  in
                                      this  statement.  You  can  retrieve the
                                      required names  by  calling   ListAvail-
                                      ableManagedRuleGroups .

                                      You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupState-
                                      ment , for example for use inside a Not-
                                      Statement  or  OrStatement . It can only
                                      be referenced as a  top-level  statement
                                      within a rule.

                                      VendorName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of the managed rule group
                                          vendor. You use this, along with the
                                          rule  group  name,  to  identify the
                                          rule group.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the managed rule  group.
                                          You  use this, along with the vendor
                                          name, to identify the rule group.

                                      Version -> (string)
                                          The  version  of  the  managed  rule
                                          group  to  use. If you specify this,
                                          the version setting is  fixed  until
                                          you  change it. If you don't specify
                                          this, WAF uses the vendor's  default
                                          version,  and then keeps the version
                                          at the  vendor's  default  when  the
                                          vendor   updates  the  managed  rule
                                          group settings.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The rules  in  the  referenced  rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates  it exactly as it would if the
                                          rule action  setting  were  Count  .
                                          This  is a useful option for testing
                                          the rules in a  rule  group  without
                                          modifying  how  they handle your web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group  whose  action  you want to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it
                                             exactly as it would if  the  rule
                                             action  setting were Count . This
                                             is a useful  option  for  testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying how  they  handle  your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of  the rule whose
                                                 action you want  to  override
                                                 to Count .

                                   LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement that defines a string
                                      match search against  labels  that  have
                                      been  added  to the web request by rules
                                      that have already run in the web ACL.

                                      The label match statement  provides  the
                                      label or namespace string to search for.
                                      The label string can represent a part or
                                      all  of  the  fully qualified label name
                                      that had been added to the web  request.
                                      Fully  qualified  labels  have a prefix,
                                      optional namespaces, and label name. The
                                      prefix  identifies the rule group or web
                                      ACL context of the rule that  added  the
                                      label.  If  you do not provide the fully
                                      qualified  name  in  your  label   match
                                      string,  WAF  performs  the  search  for
                                      labels that were added in the same  con-
                                      text as the label match statement.

                                      Scope -> (string)
                                          Specify  whether  you  want to match
                                          using the label  name  or  just  the
                                          namespace.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          The  string  to  match  against. The
                                          setting you provide for this depends
                                          on  the match statement's Scope set-
                                          ting:

                                          o If the  Scope  indicates  LABEL  ,
                                            then   this   specification   must
                                            include the name and  can  include
                                            any  number of preceding namespace
                                            specifications and  prefix  up  to
                                            providing   the   fully  qualified
                                            label name.

                                          o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE ,
                                            then    this   specification   can
                                            include any number  of  contiguous
                                            namespace strings, and can include
                                            the entire label namespace  prefix
                                            from  the  rule  group  or web ACL
                                            where the label originates.

                                          Labels are case sensitive and compo-
                                          nents  of  a label must be separated
                                          by colon, for example NS1:NS2:name .

                                   RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  search web
                                      request components for a match against a
                                      single regular expression.

                                      RegexString -> (string)
                                          The  string representing the regular
                                          expression.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-
                                             ers.  This  is  the  part  of   a
                                             request  that  contains any addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to  your  web  server as the HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body

                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect   the  HTTP  method.  The
                                             method  indicates  the  type   of

                                                    You  must  specify  either

                                                    not both.

                                                 IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                    Match only  the  specified

                                                        Don't  use this option
                                                        to include all  paths.
                                                        Instead,  use  the All

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -
                                                   Inspect  the  body as plain
                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                                 o Extra               colons:
                                                   {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that
                                          attackers use in web requests in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined  in  a managed rule group. To use this,
                               provide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the
                               rule  group in this statement. You can retrieve
                               the required names by calling   ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You  cannot  nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  It  can only be referenced as a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group  vendor.
                                   You  use  this,  along  with the rule group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this,  along with the vendor name, to iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The version of the managed  rule  group  to
                                   use.  If you specify this, the version set-
                                   ting is fixed until you change it.  If  you
                                   don't  specify  this, WAF uses the vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at  the  vendor's  default  when the vendor
                                   updates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                               ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                                   An optional nested statement  that  narrows
                                   the  scope  of  the  web  requests that are
                                   evaluated  by  the  managed   rule   group.
                                   Requests  are  only  evaluated  by the rule
                                   group if they match the  scope-down  state-
                                   ment.  You  can use any nestable  Statement
                                   in the scope-down statement,  and  you  can
                                   nest  statements  at any level, the same as
                                   you can for a rule statement.

                                   ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement that defines  a  string
                                      match  search  for  WAF  to apply to web
                                      requests. The byte match statement  pro-
                                      vides the bytes to search for, the loca-
                                      tion in requests that you  want  WAF  to
                                      search, and other settings. The bytes to
                                      search for are typically a  string  that
                                      corresponds  with  ASCII  characters. In
                                      the WAF console and the developer guide,
                                      this  is  refered  to  as a string match
                                      statement.

                                      SearchString -> (blob)
                                          A string value that you want WAF  to
                                          search for. WAF searches only in the
                                          part of web requests that you desig-
                                          nate for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                          . The maximum length of the value is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          Valid values depend on the component
                                          that you specify for  inspection  in
                                          FieldToMatch :

                                          o Method  : The HTTP method that you
                                            want WAF to search for. This indi-
                                            cates the type of operation speci-
                                            fied in the request.

                                          o UriPath : The value that you  want
                                            WAF to search for in the URI path,
                                            for example,  /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                            .

                                          If  SearchString includes alphabetic
                                          characters A-Z and  a-z,  note  that
                                          the value is case sensitive.
                                             If you're using the WAF API

                                          Specify  a base64-encoded version of
                                          the value. The maximum length of the
                                          value before you base64-encode it is
                                          50 bytes.

                                          For example, suppose  the  value  of
                                          Type is HEADER and the value of Data
                                          is  User-Agent  .  If  you  want  to
                                          search the User-Agent header for the
                                          value  BadBot  ,  you  base64-encode
                                          BadBot  using  MIME  base64-encoding
                                          and  include  the  resulting  value,
                                          QmFkQm90  ,  in the value of Search-
                                          String .
                                             If you're using the CLI or one of
                                             the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                          The  value  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                          search for.  The  SDK  automatically
                                          base64 encodes the value.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                   text. WAF applies the  text

                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON

                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:
                                                   {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  query  argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-
                                             ers.   This  is  the  part  of  a
                                             request that contains  any  addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to your web server  as  the  HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note that only  the  first  8  KB
                                             (8192  bytes) of the request body

                                             inspect  more  than 8 KB, you can
                                             guarantee that  you  don't  allow
                                             additional  bytes in by combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body  of the web request, such as
                                             ByteMatchStatement or   RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement  , with

                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  HTTP  method.   The
                                             method   indicates  the  type  of

                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the

                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the
                                                 following  examples  as   two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                      8192 bytes.

                                      If  you choose URI for the value of Part
                                      of the request to filter on,  the  slash
                                      (/)  in the URI counts as one character.
                                      For example, the URI /logo.jpg  is  nine
                                      characters long.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  query  argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-
                                             ers.   This  is  the  part  of  a
                                             request that contains  any  addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to your web server  as  the  HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note that only  the  first  8  KB
                                             (8192  bytes) of the request body
                                             are forwarded to WAF for  inspec-

                                             vice.  If  you  don't   need   to
                                             inspect  more  than 8 KB, you can
                                             guarantee that  you  don't  allow
                                             additional  bytes in by combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body  of the web request, such as
                                             ByteMatchStatement or   RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement  , with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that

                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  HTTP  method.   The
                                             method   indicates  the  type  of
                                             operation  that  the  request  is
                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.

                                                 JSON body.  The  options  are

                                                   text.  WAF applies the text

                                                   tion   criteria   that  you
                                                   defined   for   the    JSON

                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the

                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the

                                          The  operator  to use to compare the
                                          request part to the size setting.

                                      Size -> (long)
                                          The size, in byte, to compare to the
                                          request  part, after any transforma-

                                      TextTransformations -> (list)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of   the   unusual  formatting  that

                                          effort  to  bypass detection. If you
                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified

                                          (string)

                                      ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                          The  configuration for inspecting IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify,  instead  of  using  the IP
                                          address that's reported by  the  web
                                          request  origin.  Commonly,  this is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The  name  of  the HTTP header to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF) header, set this to  X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a valid  IP  address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present in the  request,  WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -   Treat   the   web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the
                                               rule statement.

                                   RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A rule statement used to run  the  rules
                                      that  are  defined  in a  RuleGroup . To
                                      use this, create a rule group with  your
                                      rules,  then provide the ARN of the rule
                                      group in this statement.

                                      You cannot nest  a  RuleGroupReferenceS-
                                      tatement  , for example for use inside a
                                      NotStatement or OrStatement  .  You  can
                                      only  use  a rule group reference state-
                                      ment at the top level inside a web  ACL.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of
                                          the entity.

                                      ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                          The rules  in  the  referenced  rule
                                          group whose actions are set to Count
                                          . When you exclude a rule, WAF eval-
                                          uates  it exactly as it would if the
                                          rule action  setting  were  Count  .
                                          This  is a useful option for testing
                                          the rules in a  rule  group  without
                                          modifying  how  they handle your web
                                          traffic.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies a single rule in a rule
                                             group  whose  action  you want to
                                             override  to  Count  .  When  you
                                             exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it
                                             exactly as it would if  the  rule
                                             action  setting were Count . This
                                             is a useful  option  for  testing
                                             the rules in a rule group without
                                             modifying how  they  handle  your
                                             web traffic.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of  the rule whose
                                                 action you want  to  override
                                                 to Count .

                                   IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  detect web
                                      requests  coming  from   particular   IP
                                      addresses  or  address  ranges.  To  use
                                      this, create an   IPSet  that  specifies
                                      the  addresses  you want to detect, then
                                      use the ARN of that set in  this  state-
                                      ment.  To  create  an  IP set, see  Cre-
                                      ateIPSet .

                                      Each IP set rule statement references an
                                      IP  set. You create and maintain the set
                                      independent of your rules.  This  allows
                                      you  to  use  the single set in multiple
                                      rules. When you  update  the  referenced
                                      set, WAF automatically updates all rules
                                      that reference it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of
                                          the   IPSet that this statement ref-
                                          erences.

                                      IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                          The configuration for inspecting  IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify, instead  of  using  the  IP
                                          address  that's  reported by the web
                                          request origin.  Commonly,  this  is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF)  header, set this to X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web

                                          Position -> (string)
                                             The  position  in  the  header to
                                             search for the  IP  address.  The
                                             header  can  contain IP addresses
                                             of the original client  and  also
                                             of   proxies.  For  example,  the
                                             header value could  be  10.1.1.1,
                                             127.0.0.0,  10.10.10.10 where the
                                             first IP address  identifies  the
                                             original   client  and  the  rest
                                             identify proxies that the request
                                             went through.

                                             The  options for this setting are
                                             the following:

                                             o FIRST - Inspect  the  first  IP
                                               address   in  the  list  of  IP
                                               addresses in the  header.  This
                                               is  usually the client's origi-
                                               nal IP.

                                             o LAST  -  Inspect  the  last  IP
                                               address   in  the  list  of  IP
                                               addresses in the header.

                                             o ANY - Inspect all IP  addresses
                                               in  the  header for a match. If
                                               the header contains  more  than
                                               10  IP  addresses, WAF inspects
                                               the last 10.

                                   RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement        ->
                                   (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  search web
                                      request components for matches with reg-
                                      ular  expressions. To use this, create a
                                      RegexPatternSet   that   specifies   the
                                      expressions  that  you  want  to detect,
                                      then use the ARN of  that  set  in  this
                                      statement.  A  web  request  matches the
                                      pattern  set  rule  statement   if   the
                                      request  component  matches  any  of the
                                      patterns in the set. To create  a  regex
                                      pattern  set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet
                                      .

                                      Each regex pattern  set  rule  statement
                                      references a regex pattern set. You cre-
                                      ate and maintain the set independent  of
                                      your  rules.  This allows you to use the
                                      single set in multiple rules.  When  you
                                      update the referenced set, WAF automati-
                                      cally updates all rules  that  reference
                                      it.

                                      ARN -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of
                                          the    RegexPatternSet   that   this
                                          statement references.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The  part  of a web request that you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single header. Provide
                                             the  name  of   the   header   to
                                             inspect,  for example, User-Agent
                                             or Referer . This  setting  isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader": {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the query  header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  a single query argument.
                                             Provide the  name  of  the  query
                                             argument   to  inspect,  such  as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name  can  be up to 30 characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web  request component for WAF to
                                             inspect,  in  the    FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-
                                             ment": { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name of the  query  argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that  identifies  a resource, for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the  part  of  a URL that appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text.  The  request  body immedi-
                                             ately follows the  request  head-
                                             ers.   This  is  the  part  of  a
                                             request that contains  any  addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to your web server  as  the  HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note that only  the  first  8  KB
                                             (8192  bytes) of the request body
                                             are forwarded to WAF for  inspec-

                                             vice.  If  you  don't   need   to
                                             inspect  more  than 8 KB, you can
                                             guarantee that  you  don't  allow
                                             additional  bytes in by combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body  of the web request, such as
                                             ByteMatchStatement or   RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement  , with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces  an  8  KB size limit on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF

                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  HTTP  method.   The
                                             method   indicates  the  type  of
                                             operation  that  the  request  is
                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.
                                             The request body immediately fol-

                                                   tion   criteria   that  you
                                                   defined   for   the    JSON

                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH  -  Treat   the   web

                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the   rule  action  to  the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates the content only up  to
                                                 the   first  parsing  failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF does its  best  to  parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might be forced to  stop  for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root node isn't an object  or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF  parses  the  JSON in the
                                                 following  examples  as   two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:

                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of  the  unusual   formatting   that
                                          attackers  use in web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.  If  you
                                          specify  one or more transformations
                                          in a rule  statement,  WAF  performs
                                          all  transformations  on the content
                                          of the request component  identified
                                          by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                                          lowest  priority   setting,   before
                                          inspecting  the content for a match.

                                   RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rate-based  rule  tracks  the rate of
                                      requests   for   each   originating   IP
                                      address,  and  triggers  the rule action
                                      when the rate exceeds a limit  that  you
                                      specify on the number of requests in any
                                      5-minute time span. You can use this  to
                                      put  a  temporary block on requests from
                                      an IP address that is sending  excessive
                                      requests.

                                      WAF tracks and manages web requests sep-
                                      arately   for   each   instance   of   a
                                      rate-based  rule that you use. For exam-
                                      ple, if you provide the same  rate-based
                                      rule  settings  in two web ACLs, each of
                                      the two  rule  statements  represents  a
                                      separate instance of the rate-based rule
                                      and gets its own tracking and management
                                      by  WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                                      inside a rule group, and then  use  that
                                      rule  group in multiple places, each use
                                      creates  a  separate  instance  of   the
                                      rate-based rule that gets its own track-
                                      ing and management by WAF.

                                      When  the  rule  action  triggers,   WAF
                                      blocks  additional  requests from the IP
                                      address until  the  request  rate  falls
                                      below the limit.

                                      You  can  optionally nest another state-
                                      ment inside the rate-based statement, to
                                      narrow  the scope of the rule so that it
                                      only  counts  requests  that  match  the
                                      nested  statement. For example, based on
                                      recent requests that you have seen  from
                                      an   attacker,   you   might   create  a
                                      rate-based rule with a nested  AND  rule
                                      statement  that  contains  the following
                                      nested statements:

                                      o An IP match statement with an  IP  set
                                        that specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                      o A string match statement that searches
                                        in   the  User-Agent  header  for  the
                                        string BadBot.

                                      In this rate-based rule, you also define
                                      a rate limit. For this example, the rate
                                      limit is 1,000. Requests that meet  both
                                      of  the conditions in the statements are
                                      counted.  If  the  count  exceeds  1,000
                                      requests  per  five  minutes,  the  rule
                                      action triggers. Requests  that  do  not
                                      meet  both  conditions  are  not counted
                                      towards  the  rate  limit  and  are  not
                                      affected by this rule.

                                      You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement
                                      inside another  statement,  for  example
                                      inside  a  NotStatement or OrStatement .
                                      You  can  define  a   RateBasedStatement
                                      inside  a  web  ACL  and  inside  a rule
                                      group.

                                      Limit -> (long)
                                          The limit on requests  per  5-minute
                                          period  for  a single originating IP
                                          address. If the statement includes a
                                          ScopeDownStatement  ,  this limit is
                                          applied only to  the  requests  that
                                          match the statement.

                                      AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                          Setting that indicates how to aggre-
                                          gate the request counts. The options
                                          are the following:

                                          o IP  - Aggregate the request counts
                                            on the IP  address  from  the  web
                                            request origin.

                                          o FORWARDED_IP   -   Aggregate   the
                                            request counts  on  the  first  IP
                                            address  in an HTTP header. If you
                                            use  this,  configure   the   For-
                                            wardedIPConfig  ,  to  specify the
                                            header to use.

                                      ( ... recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig
                                      -> (structure)
                                          The  configuration for inspecting IP
                                          addresses in an HTTP header that you
                                          specify,  instead  of  using  the IP
                                          address that's reported by  the  web
                                          request  origin.  Commonly,  this is
                                          the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                          but you can specify any header name.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          This is required if AggregateKeyType
                                          is set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                          HeaderName -> (string)
                                             The name of the  HTTP  header  to
                                             use for the IP address. For exam-
                                             ple, to use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                                             (XFF)  header, set this to X-For-
                                             warded-For .

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't  have  a valid IP address
                                             in the specified position.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 If the specified header isn't
                                                 present  in  the request, WAF
                                                 doesn't apply the rule to the
                                                 web request at all.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH   -   Treat   the  web
                                               request  as  not  matching  the

                                      other rule statements  with  AND  logic.
                                      You  provide  more  than  one  Statement
                                      within the AndStatement .

                                      Statements -> (list)
                                          The statements to combine  with  AND
                                          logic.  You  can  use any statements
                                          that can be nested.

                                   OrStatement -> (structure)
                                      A logical rule statement used to combine
                                      other rule statements with OR logic. You
                                      provide more than one  Statement  within
                                      the OrStatement .

                                      Statements -> (list)
                                          The  statements  to  combine with OR
                                          logic. You can  use  any  statements

                                   NotStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  logical rule statement used to negate
                                      the results of another  rule  statement.
                                      You  provide  one   Statement within the
                                      NotStatement .

                                   (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement that defines a string
                                      match search against  labels  that  have
                                      been  added  to the web request by rules
                                      that have already run in the web ACL.

                                      The label match statement  provides  the
                                      label or namespace string to search for.
                                      The label string can represent a part or
                                      all  of  the  fully qualified label name
                                      that had been added to the web  request.
                                      Fully  qualified  labels  have a prefix,
                                      optional namespaces, and label name. The
                                      prefix  identifies the rule group or web
                                      ACL context of the rule that  added  the
                                      label.  If  you do not provide the fully
                                      qualified  name  in  your  label   match
                                      string,  WAF  performs  the  search  for
                                      labels that were added in the same  con-
                                      text as the label match statement.

                                      Scope -> (string)
                                          Specify  whether  you  want to match
                                          using the label  name  or  just  the
                                          namespace.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          The  string  to  match  against. The
                                          setting you provide for this depends
                                          on  the match statement's Scope set-
                                          ting:

                                          o If the  Scope  indicates  LABEL  ,
                                            then   this   specification   must
                                            include the name and  can  include
                                            any  number of preceding namespace
                                            specifications and  prefix  up  to
                                            providing   the   fully  qualified
                                            label name.

                                          o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE ,
                                            then    this   specification   can
                                            include any number  of  contiguous
                                            namespace strings, and can include
                                            the entire label namespace  prefix
                                            from  the  rule  group  or web ACL
                                            where the label originates.

                                          Labels are case sensitive and compo-
                                          nents  of  a label must be separated
                                          by colon, for example NS1:NS2:name .

                                   RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                      A  rule  statement  used  to  search web
                                      request components for a match against a
                                      single regular expression.

                                      RegexString -> (string)
                                          The  string representing the regular
                                          expression.

                                      FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                          The part of a web request  that  you
                                          want WAF to inspect. For more infor-
                                          mation, see  FieldToMatch .

                                          SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single header.  Provide
                                             the   name   of   the  header  to
                                             inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                                             or  Referer  . This setting isn't
                                             case sensitive.

                                             Example JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {
                                             "Name": "haystack" }

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name of the query header
                                                 to inspect.

                                          SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                             Inspect a single query  argument.
                                             Provide  the  name  of  the query
                                             argument  to  inspect,  such   as
                                             UserName  or  SalesRegion  .  The
                                             name can be up to  30  characters
                                             long and isn't case sensitive.

                                             This is used only to indicate the
                                             web request component for WAF  to
                                             inspect,   in  the   FieldToMatch
                                             specification.

                                             Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgu-

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of the query argu-
                                                 ment to inspect.

                                          AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all query arguments.

                                          UriPath -> (structure)
                                             Inspect  the  request  URI  path.
                                             This is the part of a web request
                                             that identifies a  resource,  for
                                             example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                          QueryString -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the query string. This is
                                             the part of a  URL  that  appears
                                             after a ? character, if any.

                                          Body -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as plain
                                             text. The  request  body  immedi-
                                             ately  follows  the request head-
                                             ers.  This  is  the  part  of   a
                                             request  that  contains any addi-
                                             tional data that you want to send
                                             to  your  web  server as the HTTP
                                             request body, such as data from a
                                             form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB
                                             (8192 bytes) of the request  body
                                             are  forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                             tion by the underlying host  ser-
                                             vice.   If   you  don't  need  to
                                             inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                                             guarantee  that  you  don't allow
                                             additional bytes in by  combining
                                             a  statement  that  inspects  the
                                             body of the web request, such  as
                                             ByteMatchStatement  or  RegexPat-
                                             ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with
                                             a   SizeConstraintStatement  that
                                             enforces an 8 KB  size  limit  on
                                             the  body  of  the  request.  WAF
                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of web requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB
                                             limit.

                                          Method -> (structure)
                                             Inspect   the  HTTP  method.  The
                                             method  indicates  the  type   of
                                             operation  that  the  request  is
                                             asking the origin to perform.

                                          JsonBody -> (structure)
                                             Inspect the request body as JSON.

                                             you  want  to  send  to  your web

                                             such as data from a form.

                                             Note  that  only  the  first 8 KB

                                             doesn't  support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of web requests
                                             whose  bodies  exceed  the  8  KB

                                                 fails to completely parse the
                                                 JSON  body.  The  options are
                                                 the following:

                                                 o EVALUATE_AS_STRING        -

                                                   text. WAF applies the  text
                                                   transformations and inspec-
                                                   tion  criteria   that   you
                                                   defined    for   the   JSON
                                                   inspection to the body text
                                                   string.

                                                 o MATCH   -   Treat  the  web
                                                   request  as  matching   the
                                                   rule statement. WAF applies
                                                   the  rule  action  to   the
                                                   request.

                                                 o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web
                                                   request as not matching the
                                                   rule statement.

                                                 If  you  don't  provide  this
                                                 setting, WAF parses and eval-
                                                 uates  the content only up to
                                                 the  first  parsing   failure
                                                 that it encounters.

                                                 WAF  does  its  best to parse
                                                 the  entire  JSON  body,  but
                                                 might  be  forced to stop for
                                                 reasons such as invalid char-
                                                 acters, duplicate keys, trun-
                                                 cation, and any content whose
                                                 root  node isn't an object or
                                                 an array.

                                                 WAF parses the  JSON  in  the
                                                 following   examples  as  two
                                                 valid key, value pairs:

                                                 o Missing              comma:
                                                   {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                                 o Missing              colon:

                                          specify one or more  transformations
                                          in  a  rule  statement, WAF performs
                                          all transformations on  the  content
                                          of  the request component identified
                                          by FieldToMatch , starting from  the
                                          lowest   priority   setting,  before
                                          inspecting the content for a  match.

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  against  labels that have been added to
                               the web request by rules that have already  run
                               in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                               prefix  identifies  the  rule  group or web ACL
                               context of the rule that added  the  label.  If
                               you  do not provide the fully qualified name in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search  for  labels that were added in the same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  string  to  match against. The setting
                                   you provide for this depends on  the  match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this
                                     specification must include the  name  and
                                     can   include  any  number  of  preceding
                                     namespace specifications and prefix up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE  ,  then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of contiguous namespace strings, and  can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from the rule group or web ACL where  the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be  separated  by  colon,  for
                                   example NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name  of  the  query  header  to
                                          inspect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the  query  argument   to
                                      inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                                      . The name can be up  to  30  characters
                                      long and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies    a    resource,    for   example,
                                      /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect more than 8 KB, you can  guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes in by combining a  statement  that
                                      inspects  the  body  of the web request,
                                      such as  ByteMatchStatement  or   Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8  KB  size  limit  on  the  body of the
                                      request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  HTTP  method.  The  method
                                      indicates the type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request  body  immediately  follows  the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host  service.  If  you  don't  need  to
                                      inspect  more than 8 KB, you can guaran-
                                      tee  that  you  don't  allow  additional
                                      bytes  in  by combining a statement that
                                      inspects the body of  the  web  request,
                                      such  as   ByteMatchStatement or  Regex-
                                      PatternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with  a
                                      SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an
                                      8 KB size  limit  on  the  body  of  the
                                      request.  WAF doesn't support inspecting
                                      the  entire  contents  of  web  requests
                                      whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use  this  option   to
                                                 include  all  paths. Instead,
                                                 use the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the   text   transformations   and
                                            inspection   criteria   that   you
                                            defined for the JSON inspection to
                                            the body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the  rule  action  to  the
                                            request.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its  best  to  parse  the
                                          entire   JSON  body,  but  might  be
                                          forced to stop for reasons  such  as
                                          invalid  characters, duplicate keys,
                                          truncation, and  any  content  whose
                                          root  node  isn't  an  object  or an
                                          array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web  requests  in  an  effort  to
                                      bypass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from  lowest  priority  to  highest,
                                          before  inspecting  the  transformed
                                          content.  The  priorities don't need
                                          to be consecutive, but they must all
                                          be different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving   implementation   that
                                             ignores  characters  that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-

                                             space.

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that  were  encoded using CSS 2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,   so   it  can  help  to
                                             uncover  ASCII  characters   that
                                             were  encoded  using CSS encoding
                                             that   wouldnt    typically    be
                                             encoded.   It's  also  useful  in
                                             countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                             combination  of  a  backslash and
                                             non-hexadecimal  characters.  For
                                             example,      ja\vascript     for
                                             javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the
                                             following     ANSI    C    escape
                                             sequences: \a , \b , \f , \n , \r
                                             ,  \t  , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \" ,
                                             \xHH     (hexadecimal),     \0OOO
                                             (octal).  Encodings  that  aren't
                                             valid remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of
                                             hexadecimal   characters  into  a
                                             binary.

                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE   -    Replace
                                             HTML-encoded    characters   with
                                             unencoded             characters.
                                             HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                             operations:

                                          o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                          o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp;  with  a
                                            non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                          o Replaces   (ampersand)lt;  with  a

                                             JS_DECODE  -  Decode   JavaScript
                                             escape sequences. If a \  u  HHHH
                                             code is in the  full-width  ASCII
                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             LOWERCASE   -  Convert  uppercase
                                             letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                             MD5  - Calculate an MD5 hash from
                                             the data in the input.  The  com-
                                             puted  hash  is  in  a raw binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE - Specify NONE if you  don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH  - Remove multiple
                                             slashes,  directory   self-refer-
                                             ences,  and directory back-refer-

                                             ning  of  the input from an input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all NULL
                                             bytes from the input.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS -  Replace  each
                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                             standalone  termination of a com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS  -   Replace   NULL
                                             bytes  in  the  input  with space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             ,   but    with    support    for
                                             Microsoft-specific  %u  encoding.
                                             If the code is in the  full-width
                                             ASCII  code  range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                             wise, only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all

                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion, and minimizing  false-posi-
                                             tives   and  false-negatives  for

                     RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement  used  to  run  the  rules  that  are
                        defined  in  a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule
                        group with your rules, then provide  the  ARN  of  the
                        rule group in this statement.

                        You  cannot  nest  a RuleGroupReferenceStatement , for
                        example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        You  can  only use a rule group reference statement at
                        the top level inside a web ACL.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group  whose
                            actions  are  set  to  Count  . When you exclude a
                            rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                            rule  action setting were Count . This is a useful
                            option for testing the rules in a rule group with-
                            out modifying how they handle your web traffic.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies  a  single rule in a rule group whose
                               action you want to override to Count . When you
                               exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                               would if the rule action setting were  Count  .
                               This  is  a useful option for testing the rules
                               in a rule group without modifying how they han-
                               dle your web traffic.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                 OverrideAction -> (structure)
                     The action to use in the place of the action that results
                     from  the  rule group evaluation. Set the override action
                     to none to leave the result of the rule group alone.  Set
                     it to count to override the result to count only.

                     You  can only use this for rule statements that reference
                     a rule group, like RuleGroupReferenceStatement  and  Man-
                     agedRuleGroupStatement .

                     NOTE:
                        This option is usually set to none. It does not affect
                        how the rules in the rule group are evaluated. If  you
                        want  the  rules  in  the  rule  group  to  only count
                        matches, do not use this  and  instead  exclude  those
                        rules in your rule group reference statement settings.

                     Count -> (structure)
                        Override the rule group  evaluation  result  to  count
                        only.

                        NOTE:
                            This  option  is  usually set to none. It does not
                            affect how the rules in the rule group are  evalu-
                            ated.  If  you want the rules in the rule group to
                            only count matches, do not use  this  and  instead
                            exclude  those  rules in your rule group reference
                            statement settings.

                        CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)
                            Defines custom handling for the web request.

                            For information about customizing web requests and
                            responses,   see   Customizing  web  requests  and
                            responses in WAF in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            InsertHeaders -> (list)
                               The HTTP headers to insert  into  the  request.
                               Duplicate header names are not allowed.

                               For  information  about the limits on count and
                               size for custom request and response  settings,
                               see WAF quotas in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               (structure)
                                   A  custom  header  for  custom  request and
                                   response handling. This is used in  Custom-
                                   Response and  CustomRequestHandling .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the custom header.

                                      For  custom  request  header  insertion,
                                      when WAF inserts  the  header  into  the
                                      request,    it    prefixes   this   name
                                      x-amzn-waf- , to  avoid  confusion  with
                                      the  headers  that  are  already  in the
                                      request. For  example,  for  the  header
                                      name  sample  ,  WAF  inserts the header
                                      x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The value of the custom header.

                     None -> (structure)
                        Don't override the rule group evaluation result.  This
                        is the most common setting.

                 VisibilityConfig -> (structure)
                     Defines  and  enables  Amazon  CloudWatch metrics and web
                     request sample collection.

                     SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                        A boolean indicating whether WAF should store  a  sam-
                        pling  of  the  web requests that match the rules. You
                        can view the sampled requests through the WAF console.

                     CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                        A  boolean  indicating whether the associated resource
                        sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. For  the  list  of
                        available metrics, see WAF Metrics .

                     MetricName -> (string)
                        A  name  of the Amazon CloudWatch metric. The name can
                        contain  only  the  characters:  A-Z,  a-z,   0-9,   -
                        (hyphen), and _ (underscore). The name can be from one
                        to 128 characters long. It can't contain whitespace or
                        metric  names  reserved for WAF, for example "All" and
                        "Default_Action."

          ManagedByFirewallManager -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether this web ACL is managed by  Firewall  Manager.
              If  true,  then  only Firewall Manager can delete the web ACL or
              any Firewall Manager rule groups in the web ACL.

          LabelNamespace -> (string)
              The label namespace prefix for this web ACL. All labels added by
              rules in this web ACL have this prefix.

              o The syntax for the label namespace prefix for a web ACL is the
                following:   awswaf:<account ID>:webacl:<web ACL name>:

              o When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF  adds  the
                fully  qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label
                is made up of the label namespace from the rule group  or  web
                ACL  where  the  rule  is defined and the label from the rule,
                separated by a colon:   <label namespace>:<label from rule>

          CustomResponseBodies -> (map)
              A map of custom response keys and content bodies. When you  cre-
              ate  a  rule with a block action, you can send a custom response
              to the web request. You define these for the web ACL,  and  then
              use them in the rules and default actions that you define in the
              web ACL.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 The response body to use  in  a  custom  response  to  a  web
                 request. This is referenced by key from  CustomResponse  Cus-
                 tomResponseBodyKey .

                 ContentType -> (string)
                     The type of content in the payload that you are  defining
                     in the Content string.

                 Content -> (string)
                     The payload of the custom response.

                     You  can  use  JSON escape strings in JSON content. To do
                     this, you must specify JSON content  in  the  ContentType
                     setting.

                     For  information  about  the limits on count and size for
                     custom request and response settings, see WAF  quotas  in
                     the WAF Developer Guide .

          CaptchaConfig -> (structure)
              Specifies  how  WAF  should handle CAPTCHA evaluations for rules
              that don't have their own CaptchaConfig settings. If  you  don't
              specify  this, WAF uses its default settings for CaptchaConfig .

              ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
                 Determines how long a CAPTCHA token remains valid  after  the
                 client successfully solves a CAPTCHA puzzle.

                 ImmunityTime -> (long)
                     The  amount  of time, in seconds, that a CAPTCHA token is
                     valid. The default setting is 300.
