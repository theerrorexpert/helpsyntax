UPDATE-REGEX-PATTERN-SET()                          UPDATE-REGEX-PATTERN-SET()



NAME
       update-regex-pattern-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified  RegexPatternSet .

       NOTE:
          This  operation  completely replaces the mutable specifications that
          you already have for the regex pattern set with the  ones  that  you
          provide  to  this call. To modify the regex pattern set, retrieve it
          by calling  GetRegexPatternSet , update the settings as needed,  and
          then  provide  the  complete regex pattern set specification to this
          call.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-regex-pattern-set
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --regular-expression-list <value>
          --lock-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the set. You cannot change the name after you create the
          set.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load  Balancer  (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A unique identifier  for  the  set.  This  ID  is  returned  in  the
          responses  to create and list commands. You provide it to operations
          like update and delete.

       --description (string)
          A description of the set that helps with identification.

       --regular-expression-list (list)
          (structure)
              A single regular expression. This is used in a   RegexPatternSet
              .

              RegexString -> (string)
                 The string representing the regular expression.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegexString=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegexString": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --lock-token (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To  make  changes  to  the entity associated with the
          token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  modify the settings for an existing regex pattern set

       The  following  update-regex-pattern-set  updates  the settings for the
       specified regex pattern set. This call requires an ID,  which  you  can
       obtain  from  the call, list-regex-pattern-sets, and a lock token which
       you  can   obtain   from   the   calls,   list-regex-pattern-sets   and
       get-regex-pattern-set. This call also returns a lock token that you can
       use for a subsequent update.

          aws wafv2 update-regex-pattern-set \
              --name ExampleRegex \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --regular-expression-list RegexString="^.+$"  \
              --lock-token ed207e9c-82e9-4a77-aadd-81e6173ab7eb

       Output:

          {
              "NextLockToken": "12ebc73e-fa68-417d-a9b8-2bdd761a4fa5"
          }

       WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextLockToken -> (string)
          A  token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns this token to your
          update requests. You use NextLockToken in the same manner as you use
          LockToken .
