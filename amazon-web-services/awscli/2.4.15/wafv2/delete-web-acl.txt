NAME
       delete-web-acl -

DESCRIPTION

       You can only use this if ManagedByFirewallManager is false in the spec-

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-web-acl
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          --lock-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name  of  a  web  ACL
          after you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load  Balancer  (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          The unique identifier for the web ACL. This ID is  returned  in  the
          responses  to create and list commands. You provide it to operations
          like update and delete.

       --lock-token (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and  list  requests,  to mark the state of the entity at the time of
          the request. To make changes  to  the  entity  associated  with  the
          token,  you provide the token to operations like update and delete .
          WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made  to  the
          entity  since  you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the
          update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException .  If  this  happens,
          perform  another get , and use the new token returned by that opera-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a web ACL

       The following delete-web-acl deletes the specified web  ACL  from  your
       account.  A  web  ACL can only be deleted when it's not associated with
       any resources. This call requires an ID, which you can obtain from  the
       call,  list-web-acls,  and  a lock token, which you can obtain from the
       call list-web-acls or the call get-web-acl.

          aws wafv2 delete-web-acl \
              --name test \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --lock-token ebab4ed2-155e-4c9a-9efb-e4c45665b1f5

       This command produces no output.

       (Web ACL) in the AWS WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
