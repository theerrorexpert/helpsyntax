NAME
       list-managed-rule-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the managed rule sets that you own.

       NOTE:
          This  is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Ven-
          dors are Amazon Web Services and  Amazon  Web  Services  Marketplace
          sellers.

          Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
          rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your cus-
          tomers.  The APIs are ListManagedRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet , Put-
          ManagedRuleSetVersions , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

SYNOPSIS
            list-managed-rule-sets
          --scope <value>
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load  Balancer  (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return  for  this
          request.  If  more  objects are available, in the response, WAF pro-
          vides a NextMarker value that you can use in a  subsequent  call  to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber of objects that are still available for  retrieval  exceeds  the
          limit,  WAF  returns a NextMarker value in the response. To retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       ManagedRuleSets -> (list)
          Your managed rule sets.

          (structure)
              High-level information for a managed rule set.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  intended  for  use  only by vendors of managed rule
                 sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services
                 Marketplace sellers.

                 Vendors,  you  can  use  the managed rule set APIs to provide
                 controlled rollout  of  your  versioned  managed  rule  group
                 offerings  for  your customers. The APIs are ListManagedRule-
                 Sets , GetManagedRuleSet ,  PutManagedRuleSetVersions  ,  and
                 UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the managed rule set. You use this, along with
                 the rule set ID, to identify the rule set.

                 This name is  assigned  to  the  corresponding  managed  rule
                 group, which your customers can access and use.

              Id -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  for  the  managed  rule set. The ID is
                 returned in the responses to commands like list . You provide
                 it to operations like get and update .

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the set that helps with identification.

              LockToken -> (string)
                 A  token  used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to
                 your get and list requests, to mark the state of  the  entity
                 at  the  time  of  the request. To make changes to the entity
                 associated with the token, you provide the  token  to  opera-
                 tions  like  update and delete . WAF uses the token to ensure
                 that no changes have been made to the entity since  you  last
                 retrieved  it.  If  a  change has been made, the update fails
                 with a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,  perform
                 another  get  , and use the new token returned by that opera-
                 tion.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

              LabelNamespace -> (string)
                 The label namespace prefix for the managed rule  groups  that
                 are  offered  to  customers  from  this managed rule set. All
                 labels that are added by rules in the managed rule group have
                 this prefix.

                 o The  syntax  for  the  label namespace prefix for a managed
                   rule  group  is   the   following:     awswaf:managed:<ven-
                   dor>:<rule group name> :

                 o When  a  rule  with a label matches a web request, WAF adds
                   the fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified
                   label is made up of the label namespace from the rule group
                   or web ACL where the rule is defined and the label from the
                   rule, separated by a colon:   <label namespace>:<label from
                   rule>
