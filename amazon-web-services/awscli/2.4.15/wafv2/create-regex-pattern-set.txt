NAME
       create-regex-pattern-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  RegexPatternSet , which you reference in a  RegexPatternSe-
       tReferenceStatement , to have WAF inspect a web request  component  for
       the specified patterns.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-regex-pattern-set
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --regular-expression-list <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the set. You cannot change the name after you create the
          set.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --description (string)
          A description of the set that helps with identification.

       --regular-expression-list (list)
          Array of regular expression strings.

          (structure)
              A  single regular expression. This is used in a  RegexPatternSet
              .

              RegexString -> (string)
                 The string representing the regular expression.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegexString=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegexString": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          An array of key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

          (structure)
              A tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags  are
              key:value  pairs  that you can use to categorize and manage your
              resources, for purposes like billing or other management.  Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment",
              and the tag value represents a specific value within that  cate-
              gory,  such  as  "test,"  "development," or "production". Or you
              might set the tag key to "customer" and the value  to  the  cus-
              tomer  name  or  ID.  You can specify one or more tags to add to
              each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

              You  can  tag  the Amazon Web Services resources that you manage
              through WAF: web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and  regex  pattern
              sets. You can't manage or view tags through the WAF console.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a regex pattern set for use in your web ACLs and rule groups

       The following create-regex-pattern-set command creates a regex  pattern
       set with two regex patterns specified.

          aws wafv2 create-regex-pattern-set \
              --name regexPatterSet01 \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --description 'Test web-acl' \
              --regular-expression-list '[{"RegexString": "/[0-9]*/"},{"RegexString": "/[a-z]*/"}]'

       Output:

          {
              "Summary":{
                  "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/regexpatternset/regexPatterSet01/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "Description":"Test web-acl",
                  "Name":"regexPatterSet01",
                  "LockToken":"0bc01e21-03c9-4b98-9433-6229cbf1ef1c",
                  "Id":"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Summary -> (structure)
          High-level information about a  RegexPatternSet , returned by opera-
          tions  like  create and list. This provides information like the ID,
          that you can use to retrieve and manage a RegexPatternSet , and  the
          ARN,  that  you provide to the  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement to
          use the pattern set in a  Rule .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the data type instance. You cannot change  the  name
              after you create the instance.

          Id -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier  for  the  set. This ID is returned in the
              responses to create and list commands. You provide it to  opera-
              tions like update and delete.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the set that helps with identification.

          LockToken -> (string)
              A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your
              get and list requests, to mark the state of the  entity  at  the
              time  of  the  request. To make changes to the entity associated
              with the token, you provide the token to operations like  update
              and  delete  . WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have
              been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change
              has  been  made, the update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockExcep-
              tion . If this happens, perform another get , and  use  the  new
              token returned by that operation.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
