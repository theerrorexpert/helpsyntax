WAFV2()                                                                WAFV2()



NAME
       wafv2 -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  is  the  latest  version of the WAF API, released in November,
          2019. The names of the entities that you use  to  access  this  API,
          like  endpoints  and namespaces, all have the versioning information
          added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version.  We
          recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a
          number of significant improvements.

          If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2  API
          to  access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access
          your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only  through  the
          WAF  Classic  APIs.  The  WAF  Classic  APIs have retained the prior
          names, endpoints, and namespaces.

          For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this
          version, see the WAF Developer Guide .

       WAF  is  a  web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and
       HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an  Amazon  API
       Gateway  REST  API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AppSync GraphQL
       API. WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on  condi-
       tions  that  you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests origi-
       nate from or the values of query strings, the Amazon API  Gateway  REST
       API,  CloudFront  distribution,  the  Application Load Balancer, or the
       AppSync GraphQL API responds to requests either with the requested con-
       tent  or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can config-
       ure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.

       This  API  guide  is for developers who need detailed information about
       WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about
       WAF  features  and an overview of how to use WAF, see the WAF Developer
       Guide .

       You can make calls using the endpoints listed in WAF endpoints and quo-
       tas .

       o For  regional  applications,  you can use any of the endpoints in the
         list. A regional application can  be  an  Application  Load  Balancer
         (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API.

       o For  Amazon  CloudFront  applications,  you must use the API endpoint
         listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.

       Alternatively, you can use one of  the  Amazon  Web  Services  SDKs  to
       access  an  API that's tailored to the programming language or platform
       that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs .

       We  currently  provide  two  versions  of the WAF API: this API and the
       prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API  provides  the  same
       functionality  as the older versions, with the following major improve-
       ments:

       o You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where  you
         need  to distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope parameter and set
         it to CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL .

       o You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update
         it  with  a  single  call. You define all rule specifications in JSON
         format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.

       o The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely  reflects  the
         cost  of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity set-
         tings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use  it.
