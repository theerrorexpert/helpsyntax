NAME
       get-rate-based-statement-managed-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  keys  that  are  currently blocked by a rate-based rule
       instance. The maximum number of managed keys that can be blocked for  a
       single  rate-based  rule  instance  is  10,000.  If  more  than  10,000
       addresses exceed the rate limit,  those  with  the  highest  rates  are
       blocked.

       For  a rate-based rule that you've defined inside a rule group, provide
       the name of the rule group reference  statement  in  your  request,  in
       addition to the rate-based rule name and the web ACL name.

       WAF  monitors  web  requests  and  manages  keys independently for each
       unique combination of web ACL,  optional  rule  group,  and  rate-based
       rule. For example, if you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group,
       and then use the rule group in a web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and
       manages  keys  for  that  web  ACL, rule group reference statement, and
       rate-based rule instance. If you use the same rule group  in  a  second
       web  ACL,  WAF  monitors  web requests and manages keys for this second
       usage completely independent of your first.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rate-based-statement-managed-keys
          --scope <value>
          --web-acl-name <value>
          --web-acl-id <value>
          [--rule-group-rule-name <value>]
          --rule-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --web-acl-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL
          after you create it.

       --web-acl-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the web ACL. This ID is  returned  in  the
          responses  to create and list commands. You provide it to operations
          like update and delete.

       --rule-group-rule-name (string)
          The name of the rule group reference statement in your web ACL. This
          is  required  only when you have the rate-based rule nested inside a
          rule group.

       --rule-name (string)
          The name of the rate-based rule to get the keys for. If you have the
          rule  defined inside a rule group that you're using in your web ACL,
          also provide the name of the rule group reference statement  in  the
          request parameter RuleGroupRuleName .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  retrieve  a  list  of IP addresses that are blocked by a rate-based
       rule

       The following get-rate-based-statement-managed-keys  retrieves  the  IP
       addresses  currently blocked by a rate-based rule that's being used for
       a regional application.

          aws wafv2 get-rate-based-statement-managed-keys \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --web-acl-name testwebacl2 \
              --web-acl-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --rule-name ratebasedtest

       Output:

          {
              "ManagedKeysIPV4":{
                  "IPAddressVersion":"IPV4",
                  "Addresses":[
                      "198.51.100.0/32"
                  ]
              },
              "ManagedKeysIPV6":{
                  "IPAddressVersion":"IPV6",
                  "Addresses":[

                  ]
              }
          }
