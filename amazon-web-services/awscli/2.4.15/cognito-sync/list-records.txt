LIST-RECORDS()                                                  LIST-RECORDS()



NAME
       list-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  paginated  records,  optionally  changed  after a particular sync
       count for a dataset and identity. With Amazon Cognito Sync, each  iden-
       tity  has  access  only  to its own data. Thus, the credentials used to
       make this API call need to have access to the identity data.

       ListRecords can be called with temporary user credentials  provided  by
       Cognito  Identity or with developer credentials. You should use Cognito
       Identity credentials to make this API call.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-records
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          --identity-id <value>
          --dataset-name <value>
          [--last-sync-count <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--sync-session-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id  (string)   A   name-spaced   GUID   (for   example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Amazon Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --identity-id   (string)   A    name-spaced    GUID    (for    example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Amazon Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --dataset-name (string) A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed char-
       acters  are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (dash), and '.' (dot).

       --last-sync-count (long) The last server sync count for this record.

       --next-token (string) A pagination token for obtaining the next page of
       results.

       --max-results (integer) The maximum number of results to be returned.

       --sync-session-token (string) A token containing a session ID, identity
       ID, and expiration.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
