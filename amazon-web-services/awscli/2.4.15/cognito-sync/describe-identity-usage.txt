DESCRIBE-IDENTITY-USAGE()                            DESCRIBE-IDENTITY-USAGE()



NAME
       describe-identity-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  usage  information  for an identity, including number of datasets
       and data usage.

       This API can be called with temporary user credentials provided by Cog-
       nito Identity or with developer credentials.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-identity-usage
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          --identity-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id   (string)   A   name-spaced   GUID   (for  example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon  Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --identity-id    (string)    A    name-spaced    GUID   (for   example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon  Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          IdentityId -> (string)
              A         name-spaced         GUID         (for         example,
              us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by  Ama-
              zon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

          IdentityPoolId -> (string)
              A         name-spaced         GUID         (for         example,
              us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by  Ama-
              zon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              Date on which the identity was last modified.

          DatasetCount -> (integer)
              Number of datasets for the identity.

          DataStorage -> (long)
              Total data storage for this identity.
