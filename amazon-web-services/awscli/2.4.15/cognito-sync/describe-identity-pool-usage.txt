NAME
       describe-identity-pool-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets usage details (for example, data storage) about a particular iden-
       tity pool.

       This API can only be called with developer credentials. You cannot call
       this  API with the temporary user credentials provided by Cognito Iden-
       tity.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-identity-pool-usage
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id  (string)   A   name-spaced   GUID   (for   example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Amazon Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityPoolUsage -> (structure)
          Information about the usage of the identity pool.

          IdentityPoolId -> (string)
              A         name-spaced         GUID         (for         example,
              us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Ama-
              zon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

          SyncSessionsCount -> (long)
              Number of sync sessions for the identity pool.

          DataStorage -> (long)
              Data storage information for the identity pool.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              Date on which the identity pool was last modified.
