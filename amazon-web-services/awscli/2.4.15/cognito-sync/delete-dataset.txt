DELETE-DATASET()                                              DELETE-DATASET()



NAME
       delete-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the specific dataset. The dataset will be deleted permanently,
       and the action can't be undone. Datasets that this dataset  was  merged
       with  will no longer report the merge. Any subsequent operation on this
       dataset will result in a ResourceNotFoundException.

       This API can be called with temporary user credentials provided by Cog-
       nito Identity or with developer credentials.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-dataset
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          --identity-id <value>
          --dataset-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id   (string)   A   name-spaced   GUID   (for  example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon  Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --identity-id    (string)    A    name-spaced    GUID   (for   example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon  Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --dataset-name (string) A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed char-
       acters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (dash), and '.'  (dot).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Dataset -> (structure)
          A collection of data for an identity pool. An identity pool can have
          multiple datasets. A dataset is per identity and can be  general  or
          associated  with a particular entity in an application (like a saved
          game). Datasets are automatically created if they don't exist.  Data
          is  synced by dataset, and a dataset can hold up to 1MB of key-value
          pairs.

          IdentityId -> (string)
              A         name-spaced         GUID         (for         example,
              us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Ama-
              zon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

          DatasetName -> (string)
              A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed  characters  are  a-z,
              A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (dash), and '.' (dot).

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              Date on which the dataset was created.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              Date when the dataset was last modified.

          LastModifiedBy -> (string)
              The device that made the last change to this dataset.

          DataStorage -> (long)
              Total size in bytes of the records in this dataset.

          NumRecords -> (long)
              Number of records in this dataset.
