NAME
       cognito-sync -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Cognito  Sync  provides  an AWS service and client library that
       enable  cross-device  syncing   of   application-related   user   data.
       High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You
       can use these libraries to persist data locally so that it's  available
       even  if  the device is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be
       stored on the mobile device to access the service. You can  use  Amazon
       Cognito  to  obtain  a normalized user ID and credentials. User data is
       persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB  of  key-value  pairs,
       and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.

       With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessi-
       ble only to credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use  the
       Cognito  Sync  service,  you  need  to make API calls using credentials
       retrieved with Amazon Cognito Identity service .

       If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS  application,  you
       will  probably  want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn
       more, see the Developer Guide for Android and the Developer  Guide  for
       iOS .
