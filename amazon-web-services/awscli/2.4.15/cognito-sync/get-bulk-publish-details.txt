NAME
       get-bulk-publish-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  the status of the last BulkPublish operation for an identity pool.

       This API can only be called with developer credentials. You cannot call
       this  API with the temporary user credentials provided by Cognito Iden-
       tity.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bulk-publish-details
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id  (string)   A   name-spaced   GUID   (for   example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Amazon Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityPoolId -> (string)
          A          name-spaced          GUID          (for          example,
          us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created  by  Amazon
          Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       BulkPublishStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The date/time at which the last bulk publish was initiated.

       BulkPublishCompleteTime -> (timestamp)
          If BulkPublishStatus is SUCCEEDED, the time the  last  bulk  publish
          operation completed.

       BulkPublishStatus -> (string)
          Status of the last bulk publish operation, valid values are:

          NOT_STARTED  -  No bulk publish has been requested for this identity
          pool

          IN_PROGRESS - Data is being published to the configured stream

          SUCCEEDED - All data for the identity pool has been published to the
          configured stream

          FAILED - Some portion of the data has failed to publish, check Fail-
          ureMessage for the cause.

       FailureMessage -> (string)
          If BulkPublishStatus is FAILED this field  will  contain  the  error
          message that caused the bulk publish to fail.
