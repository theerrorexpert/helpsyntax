GET-CUSTOM-DATA-IDENTIFIER()                      GET-CUSTOM-DATA-IDENTIFIER()



NAME
       get-custom-data-identifier -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the criteria and other settings for a custom data identifier.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-custom-data-identifier
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Amazon Macie resource or account  that
          the request applies to.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom data identifier.

       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time,  in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the
          custom data identifier was created.

       deleted -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether the custom data identifier  was  deleted.  If  you
          delete a custom data identifier, Amazon Macie doesn't delete it per-
          manently. Instead, it soft deletes the identifier.

       description -> (string)
          The custom description of the custom data identifier.

       id -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the custom data identifier.

       ignoreWords -> (list)
          An array that lists specific character sequences (ignore words )  to
          exclude from the results. If the text matched by the regular expres-
          sion contains any string in this array,  Amazon  Macie  ignores  it.
          Ignore words are case sensitive.

          (string)

       keywords -> (list)
          An array that lists specific character sequences (keywords ), one of
          which must be within proximity (maximumMatchDistance) of the regular
          expression to match. Keywords aren't case sensitive.

          (string)

       maximumMatchDistance -> (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of characters that can exist between text that
          matches the regular expression and the character sequences specified
          by  the  keywords  array. Amazon Macie includes or excludes a result
          based on the proximity of a keyword to text that matches the regular
          expression.

       name -> (string)
          The custom name of the custom data identifier.

       regex -> (string)
          The regular expression (regex ) that defines the pattern to match.

       severityLevels -> (list)
          Specifies  the  severity that's assigned to findings that the custom
          data identifier produces, based on the number of occurrences of text
          that  matches  the  custom  data identifier's detection criteria. By
          default, Amazon Macie creates findings for S3 objects  that  contain
          at least one occurrence of text that matches the detection criteria,
          and Macie assigns the MEDIUM severity to those findings.

          (structure)
              Specifies a severity level for findings that a custom data iden-
              tifier  produces.  A severity level determines which severity is
              assigned to the findings, based on the number of occurrences  of
              text  that matches the custom data identifier's detection crite-
              ria.

              occurrencesThreshold -> (long)
                 The minimum number of occurrences of text that must match the
                 custom  data identifier's detection criteria in order to pro-
                 duce a finding with the specified severity (severity).

              severity -> (string)
                 The severity to assign to a finding: if the number of  occur-
                 rences  is  greater  than or equal to the specified threshold
                 (occurrencesThreshold); and, if  applicable,  the  number  of
                 occurrences  is less than the threshold for the next consecu-
                 tive severity level for the custom  data  identifier,  moving
                 from LOW to HIGH.

       tags -> (map)
          A  map of key-value pairs that identifies the tags (keys and values)
          that are associated with the custom data identifier.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
