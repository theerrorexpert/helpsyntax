SYNOPSIS
            put-findings-publication-configuration
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--security-hub-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the  idem-
          potency of the request.

       --security-hub-configuration (structure)
          The  configuration settings that determine which findings to publish
          to Security Hub.

          publishClassificationFindings -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether to publish sensitive data findings to Security
              Hub.  If  you set this value to true, Amazon Macie automatically
              publishes all sensitive data findings that weren't suppressed by
              a findings filter. The default value is false.

          publishPolicyFindings -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether to publish policy findings to Security Hub. If
              you set this value to true, Amazon Macie automatically publishes
              all new and updated policy findings that weren't suppressed by a
              findings filter. The default value is true.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          publishClassificationFindings=boolean,publishPolicyFindings=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "publishClassificationFindings": true|false,
            "publishPolicyFindings": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
