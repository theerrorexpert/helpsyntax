       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-invitations
          --account-ids <value>
          [--disable-email-notification | --no-disable-email-notification]
          [--message <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          An  array  that  lists Amazon Web Services account IDs, one for each
          account to send the invitation to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --disable-email-notification     |      --no-disable-email-notification
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  send  the invitation as an email message. If
          this value is false, Amazon Macie sends the invitation (as an  email
          message) to the email address that you specified for the recipient's
          account when you associated  the  account  with  your  account.  The
          default value is false.

       --message (string)
          Custom  text to include in the email message that contains the invi-
          tation. The text can contain as many as 80 alphanumeric  characters.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       unprocessedAccounts -> (list)
          An  array  of  objects, one for each account whose invitation hasn't
          been processed. Each object identifies the account and explains  why
          the invitation hasn't been processed for the account.

          (structure)
              Provides  information  about  an  account-related  request  that
              hasn't been processed.

              accountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID for the account  that  the
                 request applies to.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The source of the issue or delay in processing the request.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The reason why the request hasn't been processed.
