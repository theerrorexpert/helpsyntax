GET-USAGE-STATISTICS()                                  GET-USAGE-STATISTICS()



NAME
       get-usage-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  (queries)  quotas  and aggregated usage data for one or more
       accounts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-usage-statistics is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: records

          [--filter-by <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--time-range <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --filter-by (list)
          An  array  of  objects,  one for each condition to use to filter the
          query results. If you specify more than one condition, Amazon  Macie
          uses an AND operator to join the conditions.

          (structure)
              Specifies  a  condition for filtering the results of a query for
              quota and usage data for one or more Amazon Macie accounts.

              comparator -> (string)
                 The operator to use in the condition. If the  value  for  the
                 key  property  is  accountId, this value must be CONTAINS. If
                 the value for the key property is any other supported  field,
                 this value can be EQ, GT, GTE, LT, LTE, or NE.

              key -> (string)
                 The field to use in the condition.

              values -> (list)
                 An  array that lists values to use in the condition, based on
                 the value for the field specified by the key property. If the
                 value for the key property is accountId, this array can spec-
                 ify multiple values. Otherwise, this array can  specify  only
                 one value.

                 Valid values for each supported field are:

                 o accountId  -  The  unique identifier for an Amazon Web Ser-
                   vices account.

                 o freeTrialStartDate - The date and time, in UTC and extended
                   ISO  8601  format,  when  the  free  trial  started  for an
                   account.

                 o serviceLimit - A Boolean (true or false) value  that  indi-
                   cates whether an account has reached its monthly quota.

                 o total - A string that represents the current estimated cost
                   for an account.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          comparator=string,key=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "comparator": "GT"|"GTE"|"LT"|"LTE"|"EQ"|"NE"|"CONTAINS",
              "key": "accountId"|"serviceLimit"|"freeTrialStartDate"|"total",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-by (structure)
          The criteria to use to sort the query results.

          key -> (string)
              The field to sort the results by.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The sort order to apply to the results, based on the  value  for
              the  field specified by the key property. Valid values are: ASC,
              sort the results in ascending order; and, DESC, sort the results
              in descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "key": "accountId"|"total"|"serviceLimitValue"|"freeTrialStartDate",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --time-range (string)
          The inclusive time period to query usage data for. Valid values are:
          MONTH_TO_DATE,  for  the  current  calendar  month  to  date;   and,
          PAST_30_DAYS,  for  the  preceding  30  days. If you don't specify a
          value, Amazon Macie provides usage data for the preceding 30 days.

          Possible values:

          o MONTH_TO_DATE

          o PAST_30_DAYS

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 usage metric and the corresponding quota.

                 (structure)
                     Provides data for a specific usage metric and the  corre-

                            Specifies  whether  the  account has met the quota
                            that corresponds to the metric  specified  by  the
                            UsageByAccount.type field in the response.

                        unit -> (string)
                            The unit of measurement for the value specified by

                        objects to detect sensitive data.

       timeRange -> (string)
          The inclusive time period that the usage data applies  to.  Possible
          values  are:  MONTH_TO_DATE, for the current calendar month to date;
