NAME
       get-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the details of one or more findings.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-findings
          --finding-ids <value>
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --finding-ids (list)
          An  array of strings that lists the unique identifiers for the find-
          ings to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          The criteria for sorting the results of the request.

          attributeName -> (string)
              The name of the property to sort the results by. This value  can
              be  the  name  of  any  property that Amazon Macie defines for a
              finding.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The sort order to apply to the results, based on the  value  for
              the property specified by the attributeName property. Valid val-
              ues are: ASC, sort the results in ascending  order;  and,  DESC,
              sort the results in descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributeName=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributeName": "string",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       findings -> (list)
          An  array  of  objects, one for each finding that meets the criteria
          specified in the request.

          (structure)
              Provides the details of a finding.

              accountId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the  Amazon  Web  Services  account
                 that  the  finding  applies to. This is typically the account
                 that owns the affected resource.

              archived -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the finding is archived (suppressed).

              category -> (string)
                 The category of the finding. Possible values are: CLASSIFICA-
                 TION, for a sensitive data finding; and, POLICY, for a policy
                 finding.

              classificationDetails -> (structure)
                 The details of a sensitive data finding. This value  is  null
                 for a policy finding.

                 detailedResultsLocation -> (string)
                     The  path  to the folder or file (in Amazon S3) that con-
                     tains the corresponding sensitive data  discovery  result
                     for  the finding. If a finding applies to a large archive
                     or compressed file, this value is the path to  a  folder.
                     Otherwise, this value is the path to a file.

                 jobArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the classification job
                     that produced the finding.

                 jobId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for  the  classification  job  that
                     produced the finding.

                 result -> (structure)
                     The status and other details of the finding.

                     additionalOccurrences -> (boolean)
                        Specifies  whether  Amazon  Macie  detected additional
                        occurrences of sensitive data  in  the  S3  object.  A
                        finding  includes  location  data  for a maximum of 15
                        occurrences of sensitive data.

                        This value can help you determine whether to  investi-
                        gate  additional  occurrences  of sensitive data in an
                        object. You can do this by  referring  to  the  corre-
                        sponding sensitive data discovery result for the find-
                        ing (ClassificationDetails.detailedResultsLocation).

                                      data.  For  a  JSON  or JSON Lines file,
                                      each Record object specifies the path to
                                      a  field or array that contains the sen-
                                      sitive data. For a JSON Lines  file,  it
                                      also  specifies  the  index  of the line
                                      that contains the data.

                                      (structure)

                                             sion,  to the sensitive data. For
                                             an Avro object container or  Par-
                                             quet  file,  this  is the path to
                                             the   field   in    the    record
                                             (recordIndex)  that  contains the
                                             data. For a JSON  or  JSON  Lines
                                             file,  this  is  the  path to the
                                             field or array that contains  the
                                             data.  If  the data is a value in
                                             an array, the path also indicates
                                             which value contains the data.

                                             If Amazon Macie detects sensitive

                                             in  the  path,  Macie  omits this
                                             field. If the name of an  element
                                             exceeds   20   characters,  Macie
                                             truncates the  name  by  removing
                                             characters  from the beginning of
                                             the name. If the  resulting  full
                                             path   exceeds   250  characters,
                                             Macie also  truncates  the  path,
                                             starting  with  the first element
                                             in the path, until the path  con-

                                             starting  from  0, for the record
                                             that contains the sensitive data.
                                             For  a  JSON Lines file, the line
                                             index, starting from 0,  for  the
                                             line  that contains the sensitive
                                             data. This value is always 0  for

                                      records -> (list)
                                          An  array  of  objects, one for each
                                          occurrence of sensitive data  in  an
                                          Apache Avro object container, Apache
                                          Parquet file,  JSON  file,  or  JSON
                                          Lines  file.  This value is null for
                                          all other types of files.

                                          For an Avro object container or Par-
                                          quet file, each Record object speci-
                                          fies a record index and the path  to
                                          a  field  in  a record that contains
                                          the sensitive data. For  a  JSON  or
                                          JSON  Lines file, each Record object
                                          specifies the path  to  a  field  or
                                          array  that  contains  the sensitive
                                          data. For a JSON Lines file, it also
                                          specifies the index of the line that
                                          contains the data.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies  the  location  of   an
                                             occurrence  of  sensitive data in
                                             an Apache Avro object  container,
                                             Apache  Parquet  file, JSON file,
                                             or JSON Lines file.

                                             jsonPath -> (string)
                                                 The  path,  as   a   JSONPath
                                                 expression,  to the sensitive
                                                 data. For an Avro object con-
                                                 tainer  or Parquet file, this
                                                 is the path to the  field  in
                                                 the record (recordIndex) that
                                                 contains the data. For a JSON
                                                 or  JSON  Lines file, this is
                                                 the  path  to  the  field  or
                                                 array that contains the data.
                                                 If the data is a value in  an
                                                 array,  the  path  also indi-
                                                 cates  which  value  contains
                                                 the data.

                                                 If  Amazon Macie detects sen-
                                                 sitive data in  the  name  of
                                                 any   element  in  the  path,
                                                 Macie omits  this  field.  If
                                                 the   name   of   an  element
                                                 exceeds 20 characters,  Macie
                                                 truncates  the name by remov-
                                                 ing   characters   from   the
                                                 beginning of the name. If the
                                                 resulting full  path  exceeds
                                                 250  characters,  Macie  also
                                                 truncates the path,  starting
                                                 with the first element in the
                                                 path, until the path contains
                                                 250 or fewer characters.

                                             recordIndex -> (long)
                                                 For  an Avro object container

                                                 index,  starting  from 0, for
                                                 the record that contains  the
                                                 sensitive  data.  For  a JSON
                                                 Lines file, the  line  index,
                                                 starting from 0, for the line
                                                 that contains  the  sensitive
                                                 data.  This value is always 0
                                                 for JSON files.
