            update-findings-filter
          [--action <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--finding-criteria <value>]
          --id <value>

OPTIONS
       --action (string)
          The  action  to  perform  on  findings that meet the filter criteria
          (findingCriteria). Valid values are:  ARCHIVE,  suppress  (automati-
          cally  archive) the findings; and, NOOP, don't perform any action on
          the findings.

          Possible values:

          o ARCHIVE

          o NOOP

       --description (string)
          A custom description of the filter. The description can  contain  as
          many as 512 characters.

          We strongly recommend that you avoid including any sensitive data in
          the description of a filter. Other users might be able to  see  this
          description,  depending  on the actions that they're allowed to per-
          form in Amazon Macie.

       --finding-criteria (structure)
          The criteria to use to filter findings.

          criterion -> (map)
              A condition that specifies the property, operator,  and  one  or
              more values to use to filter the results.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  operator to use in a property-based condition
                 that filters  the  results  of  a  query  for  findings.  For
                 detailed  information  and  examples  of  each  operator, see
                 Fundamentals of filtering findings in the Amazon  Macie  User
                 Guide .

                 eq -> (list)
                     The value for the property matches (equals) the specified
                     value. If you specify  multiple  values,  Macie  uses  OR
                     logic to join the values.

                     (string)

                 eqExactMatch -> (list)
                     The value for the property exclusively matches (equals an
                     exact match for) all the specified values. If you specify
                     multiple  values, Amazon Macie uses AND logic to join the
                     values.

                     You can use this operator with the following  properties:
                     customDataIdentifiers.detections.arn,   customDataIdenti-
                     fiers.detections.name,                       resourcesAf-
                     fected.s3Bucket.tags.key,                    resourcesAf-
                     fected.s3Bucket.tags.value,                  resourcesAf-
                     fected.s3Object.tags.key,                    resourcesAf-
                     fected.s3Object.tags.value,  sensitiveData.category,  and
                     sensitiveData.detections.type.

                     (string)

                 gt -> (long)
                     The  value for the property is greater than the specified
                     value.

                 gte -> (long)
                     The value for the property is greater than  or  equal  to
                     the specified value.

                 lt -> (long)
                     The  value  for  the  property is less than the specified
                     value.

                 lte -> (long)
                     The value for the property is less than or equal  to  the
                     specified value.

                 neq -> (list)
                     The  value for the property doesn't match (doesn't equal)
                     the specified value.  If  you  specify  multiple  values,
                     Macie uses OR logic to join the values.

                     (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          criterion={KeyName1={eq=[string,string],eqExactMatch=[string,string],gt=long,gte=long,lt=long,lte=long,neq=[string,string]},KeyName2={eq=[string,string],eqExactMatch=[string,string],gt=long,gte=long,lt=long,lte=long,neq=[string,string]}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "criterion": {"string": {
                  "eq": ["string", ...],
                  "eqExactMatch": ["string", ...],
                  "gt": long,
                  "gte": long,
                  "lt": long,
                  "lte": long,
                  "neq": ["string", ...]
                }
              ...}
          }

       --id (string)
          The  unique identifier for the Amazon Macie resource or account that
          the request applies to.

       --name (string)
          A custom name for the filter. The name must contain at least 3 char-
          acters and can contain as many as 64 characters.

          We strongly recommend that you avoid including any sensitive data in
          the name of a filter. Other users might be able to  see  this  name,
          depending  on  the actions that they're allowed to perform in Amazon
          Macie.

       --position (integer)
          The position of the filter in the list of saved filters on the  Ama-
          zon Macie console. This value also determines the order in which the
          filter is applied to findings, relative to other  filters  that  are
          also applied to the findings.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the idem-
          potency of the request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the filter that was updated.

       id -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the filter that was updated.
