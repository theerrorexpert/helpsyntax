NAME
       get-classification-export-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  configuration  settings for storing data classification
       results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-classification-export-configuration
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       configuration -> (structure)
          The location where data classification results are stored,  and  the
          encryption settings that are used when storing results in that loca-
          tion.

          s3Destination -> (structure)
              The S3 bucket to store data classification results in,  and  the
              encryption  settings to use when storing results in that bucket.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket.

              keyPrefix -> (string)
                 The path prefix to use in the path to  the  location  in  the
                 bucket.  This  prefix specifies where to store classification
                 results in the bucket.

              kmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  KMS  key  to  use  for
                 encryption  of the results. This must be the ARN of an exist-
                 ing, symmetric, customer managed KMS key that's in  the  same
                 Amazon Web Services Region as the bucket.
