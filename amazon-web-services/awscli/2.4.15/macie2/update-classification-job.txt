       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-classification-job
          --job-id <value>
          --job-status <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the classification job.

       --job-status (string)
          The new status for the job. Valid values are:

          o CANCELLED  -  Stops the job permanently and cancels it. This value
            is valid only if the job's current status is  IDLE,  PAUSED,  RUN-
            NING, or USER_PAUSED. If you specify this value and the job's cur-
            rent status is RUNNING, Amazon Macie immediately  begins  to  stop
            all  processing  tasks  for the job. You can't resume or restart a
            job after you cancel it.

          o RUNNING - Resumes the job. This value is valid only if  the  job's
            current  status is USER_PAUSED. If you paused the job while it was
            actively running and you specify this  value  less  than  30  days
            after  you  paused  the  job, Macie immediately resumes processing
            from the point where you paused the job. Otherwise, Macie  resumes
            the  job according to the schedule and other settings for the job.

          o USER_PAUSED - Pauses the job temporarily. This value is valid only
            if  the  job's  current status is IDLE, PAUSED, or RUNNING. If you
            specify this value and the job's current status is RUNNING,  Macie
            immediately  begins  to pause all processing tasks for the job. If
            you pause a one-time job and you don't resume it within  30  days,
            the  job  expires and Macie cancels the job. If you pause a recur-
            ring job when its status is RUNNING and you don't resume it within
            30  days,  the job run expires and Macie cancels the run. To check
            the expiration date, refer to  the  UserPausedDetails.jobExpiresAt
            property.

          Possible values:

          o RUNNING

          o PAUSED

          o CANCELLED

          o COMPLETE

          o IDLE

          o USER_PAUSED

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
