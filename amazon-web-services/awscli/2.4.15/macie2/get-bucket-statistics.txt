NAME
       get-bucket-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  (queries)  aggregated statistical data about S3 buckets that
       Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-statistics
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       bucketCount -> (long)
          The total number of buckets.

       bucketCountByEffectivePermission -> (structure)
          The total number of buckets that are publicly accessible based on  a
          combination of permissions settings for each bucket.

          publiclyAccessible -> (long)
              The  total  number  of  buckets that allow the general public to
              have read or write access to the bucket.

          publiclyReadable -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that allow  the  general  public  to
              have read access to the bucket.

          publiclyWritable -> (long)
              The  total  number  of  buckets that allow the general public to
              have write access to the bucket.

          unknown -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that Amazon  Macie  wasn't  able  to
              evaluate permissions settings for. Macie can't determine whether
              these buckets are publicly accessible.

       bucketCountByEncryptionType -> (structure)
          The total number of buckets that use certain  types  of  server-side
          encryption  to  encrypt  new  objects  by  default. This object also
          reports the total number of buckets that don't encrypt  new  objects
          by default.

          kmsManaged -> (long)
              The  total  number of buckets that use an KMS key to encrypt new
              objects by default, either an Amazon Web Services managed key or
              a  customer  managed  key.  These  buckets  use  KMS  encryption
              (SSE-KMS) by default.

          s3Managed -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that use an Amazon S3 managed key to
              encrypt new objects by default. These buckets use Amazon S3 man-
              aged encryption (SSE-S3) by default.

          unencrypted -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that don't encrypt  new  objects  by
              default. Default encryption is disabled for these buckets.

          unknown -> (long)
              The  total number of buckets that Amazon Macie doesn't have cur-
              rent encryption metadata for. Macie can't provide  current  data
              about the default encryption settings for these buckets.

       bucketCountByObjectEncryptionRequirement -> (structure)
          The  total  number  of  buckets  whose  bucket  policies do or don't
          require server-side encryption of objects when objects are  uploaded
          to the buckets.

          allowsUnencryptedObjectUploads -> (long)
              The  total  number of buckets that don't have a bucket policy or
              have a bucket policy that doesn't require server-side encryption
              of  new  objects.  If a bucket policy exists, the policy doesn't
              require     PutObject     requests      to      include      the
              x-amz-server-side-encryption  header  and it doesn't require the
              value for that header to be AES256 or aws:kms.

          deniesUnencryptedObjectUploads -> (long)
              The total  number  of  buckets  whose  bucket  policies  require
              server-side  encryption  of  new objects. PutObject requests for
              these  buckets  must  include  the  x-amz-server-side-encryption
              header  and the value for that header must be AES256 or aws:kms.

          unknown -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that Amazon  Macie  wasn't  able  to
              evaluate  server-side  encryption  requirements for. Macie can't
              determine whether the bucket policies for these buckets  require
              server-side encryption of new objects.

       bucketCountBySharedAccessType -> (structure)
          The  total  number of buckets that are or aren't shared with another

              Services  account that isn't part of the same Amazon Macie orga-
              nization.

          internal -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that are shared with an  Amazon  Web

              Web Services accounts.

          unknown -> (long)
              The  total  number  of  buckets that Amazon Macie wasn't able to
              evaluate shared  access  settings  for.  Macie  can't  determine
              whether  these buckets are shared with other Amazon Web Services
              accounts.

       classifiableObjectCount -> (long)
          The total number of objects that Amazon Macie  can  analyze  in  the
          buckets. These objects use a supported storage class and have a file
          name extension for a supported file or storage format.

       classifiableSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The total storage size, in bytes, of all  the  objects  that  Amazon
          Macie  can  analyze  in  the  buckets. These objects use a supported
          storage class and have a file name extension for a supported file or
          storage format.

          If  versioning  is  enabled for any of the buckets, Macie calculates
          this value based on the size of the latest version of each  applica-
          ble  object in those buckets. This value doesn't reflect the storage
          size of all versions of all applicable objects in the buckets.

       lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when  Amazon
          Macie  most  recently retrieved both bucket and object metadata from
          Amazon S3 for the buckets.

          The total number of objects in the buckets.

       sizeInBytes -> (long)
          The total storage size, in bytes, of the buckets.

          If versioning is enabled for any of the buckets, Amazon Macie calcu-
          lates  this  value  based  on the size of the latest version of each
          object in those buckets. This value doesn't reflect the storage size
          of all versions of the objects in the buckets.

       sizeInBytesCompressed -> (long)
          The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that are compressed
          (.gz, .gzip, .zip) files in the buckets.

          If versioning is enabled for any of the buckets, Amazon Macie calcu-
          lates  this  value  based  on the size of the latest version of each
          applicable object in those buckets. This value doesn't  reflect  the
          storage  size of all versions of the applicable objects in the buck-
          ets.

       unclassifiableObjectCount -> (structure)
          The total number of objects that Amazon Macie can't analyze  in  the
          buckets.  These objects don't use a supported storage class or don't
          have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format.

          total -> (long)
              The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects that Ama-
              zon  Macie  can't analyze because the objects use an unsupported

              ported file or storage format.

       unclassifiableObjectSizeInBytes -> (structure)
          The  total  storage size, in bytes, of the objects that Amazon Macie
          can't analyze in the buckets. These objects don't  use  a  supported

          file or storage format.

          fileType -> (long)
              The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects that Ama-
              zon  Macie  can't  analyze because the objects don't have a file
