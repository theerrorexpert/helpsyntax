OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the  idem-
          potency of the request.

       --description (string)
          A  custom description of the custom data identifier. The description
          can contain as many as 512 characters.

          We strongly recommend that you avoid including any sensitive data in
          the  description  of  a  custom data identifier. Other users of your
          account might be able to see  this  description,  depending  on  the
          actions that they're allowed to perform in Amazon Macie.

       --ignore-words (list)
          An  array that lists specific character sequences (ignore words ) to
          exclude from the results. If the text matched by the regular expres-
          sion contains any string in this array, Amazon Macie ignores it. The
          array can contain as many as 10 ignore words. Each ignore  word  can
          contain 4-90 UTF-8 characters. Ignore words are case sensitive.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --keywords (list)
          An array that lists specific character sequences (keywords ), one of
          which must be within proximity (maximumMatchDistance) of the regular
          expression  to  match. The array can contain as many as 50 keywords.
          Each keyword can contain 3-90 UTF-8 characters. Keywords aren't case
          sensitive.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --maximum-match-distance (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of characters that can exist between text that
          matches the regular expression and the character sequences specified
          by  the  keywords  array. Amazon Macie includes or excludes a result
          based on the proximity of a keyword to text that matches the regular
          expression.  The distance can be 1-300 characters. The default value
          is 50.

       --name (string)
          A custom name for the custom data identifier. The name  can  contain
          as many as 128 characters.

          We strongly recommend that you avoid including any sensitive data in
          the name of a custom data identifier. Other users  of  your  account
          might  be  able  to  see  this  name,  depending on the actions that
          they're allowed to perform in Amazon Macie.

       --regex (string)
          The regular expression (regex ) that defines the pattern  to  match.
          The expression can contain as many as 512 characters.

       --severity-levels (list)
          The  severity  to assign to findings that the custom data identifier
          produces, based on the number of occurrences of  text  that  matches
          the  custom data identifier's detection criteria. You can specify as
          many as three SeverityLevel objects in  this  array,  one  for  each
          severity:  LOW,  MEDIUM,  or HIGH. If you specify more than one, the
          occurrences thresholds must be in ascending order by severity,  mov-
          ing from LOW to HIGH. For example, 1 for LOW, 50 for MEDIUM, and 100
          for HIGH. If an S3 object contains fewer occurrences than the lowest
          specified threshold, Amazon Macie doesn't create a finding.

          If  you don't specify any values for this array, Macie creates find-
          ings for S3 objects that contain at least  one  occurrence  of  text
          that  matches  the  detection criteria, and Macie assigns the MEDIUM
          severity to those findings.

          (structure)
              Specifies a severity level for findings that a custom data iden-
              tifier  produces.  A severity level determines which severity is
              assigned to the findings, based on the number of occurrences  of
              text  that matches the custom data identifier's detection crite-
              ria.

              occurrencesThreshold -> (long)
                 The minimum number of occurrences of text that must match the
                 custom  data identifier's detection criteria in order to pro-
                 duce a finding with the specified severity (severity).

              severity -> (string)
                 The severity to assign to a finding: if the number of  occur-
                 rences  is  greater  than or equal to the specified threshold
                 (occurrencesThreshold); and, if  applicable,  the  number  of
                 occurrences  is less than the threshold for the next consecu-
                 tive severity level for the custom  data  identifier,  moving
                 from LOW to HIGH.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          occurrencesThreshold=long,severity=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "occurrencesThreshold": long,
              "severity": "LOW"|"MEDIUM"|"HIGH"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          A  map  of key-value pairs that specifies the tags to associate with
          the custom data identifier.

          A custom data identifier can have a maximum of  50  tags.  Each  tag
          consists  of  a  tag  key  and  an associated tag value. The maximum
          length of a tag key is 128 characters. The maximum length of  a  tag
          value is 256 characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       customDataIdentifierId -> (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the custom data identifier that was cre-
          ated.
