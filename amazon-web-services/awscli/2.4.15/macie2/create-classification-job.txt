OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the idem-
          potency of the request.

       --custom-data-identifier-ids (list)
          An array of unique identifiers, one for each custom data  identifier
          for  the  job to use when it analyzes data. To use only managed data
          identifiers, don't specify a value for this property and  specify  a
          value  other  than  NONE for the managedDataIdentifierSelector prop-
          erty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --description (string)
          A custom description of the job. The description can contain as many
          as 200 characters.

       --initial-run | --no-initial-run (boolean)
          For a recurring job, specifies whether to analyze all existing, eli-
          gible objects immediately after the job is created (true).  To  ana-
          lyze only those objects that are created or changed after you create
          the job and before the job's first scheduled run, set this value  to
          false.

          If you configure the job to run only once, don't specify a value for
          this property.

       --job-type (string)
          The schedule for running the job. Valid values are:

          o ONE_TIME - Run the job only once. If you specify this value, don't
            specify a value for the scheduleFrequency property.

          o SCHEDULED  -  Run the job on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. If
            you specify this value,  use  the  scheduleFrequency  property  to
            define the recurrence pattern for the job.

          Possible values:

          o ONE_TIME

          o SCHEDULED

       --managed-data-identifier-ids (list)
          An array of unique identifiers, one for each managed data identifier
          for the job to include (use) or exclude (not use) when  it  analyzes
          data.  Inclusion or exclusion depends on the managed data identifier
          selection type that you specify for the job (managedDataIdentifierS-
          elector).

          To  retrieve a list of valid values for this property, use the List-
          ManagedDataIdentifiers operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --managed-data-identifier-selector (string)
          The selection type to apply  when  determining  which  managed  data
          identifiers the job uses to analyze data. Valid values are:

          o ALL  - Use all the managed data identifiers that Amazon Macie pro-
            vides. If you specify this value, don't specify any values for the
            managedDataIdentifierIds property.

          o EXCLUDE - Use all the managed data identifiers that Macie provides
            except the managed data  identifiers  specified  by  the  managed-
            DataIdentifierIds property.

          o INCLUDE  -  Use only the managed data identifiers specified by the
            managedDataIdentifierIds property.

          o NONE - Don't use any managed data identifiers. If you specify this
            value,  specify  at  least  one custom data identifier for the job
            (customDataIdentifierIds) and don't specify  any  values  for  the
            managedDataIdentifierIds property.

          If  you  don't  specify  a value for this property, the job uses all
          managed data identifiers. If you don't  specify  a  value  for  this
          property  or you specify ALL or EXCLUDE for a recurring job, the job
          also uses new managed data identifiers as they are released.

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o EXCLUDE

          o INCLUDE

          o NONE

       --name (string)
          A custom name for the job. The name can contain as many as 500 char-
          acters.

       --s3-job-definition (structure)
          The S3 buckets that contain the objects to analyze, and the scope of
          that analysis.

          bucketDefinitions -> (list)
              An array of objects, one for each Amazon  Web  Services  account
              that  owns specific S3 buckets to analyze. Each object specifies
              the account ID for an account and one or more buckets to analyze
              for that account. A job's definition can contain a bucketDefini-
              tions array or a bucketCriteria object, not both.

              (structure)
                 Specifies an Amazon Web Services account that owns S3 buckets
                 for a classification job to analyze, and one or more specific
                 buckets to analyze for that account.

                 accountId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account
                     that owns the buckets.

                 buckets -> (list)
                     An array that lists the names of the buckets.

                     (string)

          scoping -> (structure)
              The  property-  and tag-based conditions that determine which S3
              objects to include or exclude from the analysis. Each  time  the
              job runs, the job uses these criteria to determine which objects
              to analyze.

              excludes -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 objects to exclude from the analysis.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each  property-  or
                     tag-based condition  that  determines  which  objects  to
                     include or exclude from the job. If you specify more than
                     one condition, Amazon Macie uses AND logic  to  join  the
                     conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  a  property-  or  tag-based  condition that
                        defines criteria for including or excluding S3 objects
                        from  a  classification job. A JobScopeTerm object can
                        contain  only  one  simpleScopeTerm  object   or   one
                        tagScopeTerm object.

                        simpleScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  property-based  condition  that defines a prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values for each supported property (key) are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - EQ  (equals)  or  NE  (not
                                 equals)

                               o OBJECT_KEY - STARTS_WITH

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE   -   Any  operator
                                 except CONTAINS

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - Any operator except CONTAINS

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use in the condition.

                            values -> (list)
                               An array that lists the values to  use  in  the
                               condition. If the value for the key property is
                               OBJECT_EXTENSION or OBJECT_KEY, this array  can
                               specify  multiple  values and Amazon Macie uses
                               OR logic to join the  values.  Otherwise,  this
                               array can specify only one value.

                               Valid  values for each supported property (key)
                               are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - A string  that  represents
                                 the  file  name  extension  of an object. For
                                 example: docx or pdf

                               o OBJECT_KEY - A string that represents the key
                                 prefix  (folder  name  or path) of an object.
                                 For example: logs or awslogs/eventlogs.  This
                                 value  applies  a  condition to objects whose
                                 keys (names) begin with the specified  value.

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - The date and time
                                 (in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format) when an
                                 object was created or last changed, whichever
                                 is latest. For example: 2020-09-28T14:31:13Z

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - An integer that represents  the
                                 storage size (in bytes) of an object.

                               Macie  doesn't  support use of wildcard charac-
                               ters in these values. Also, string  values  are
                               case sensitive.

                               (string)

                        tagScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  tag-based  condition  that defines the operator
                            and tag keys  or  tag  key  and  value  pairs  for
                            including or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values are EQ (equals) or NE (not equals).

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use  in  the  condition.
                               The only valid value is TAG.

                            tagValues -> (list)
                               The  tag keys or tag key and value pairs to use
                               in the condition. To specify only tag keys in a
                               condition,  specify  the keys in this array and
                               set the value for each associated tag value  to
                               an empty string.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  a  tag  key or tag key and value
                                   pair to use in a tag-based  condition  that
                                   determines whether an S3 object is included
                                   or excluded from a classification job.  Tag
                                   keys  and  values are case sensitive. Also,
                                   Amazon Macie doesn't support use of partial
                                   values  or wildcard characters in tag-based
                                   conditions.

                                   key -> (string)
                                      The value for the tag key to use in  the
                                      condition.

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The tag value, associated with the spec-
                                      ified tag key (key), to use in the  con-
                                      dition.  To specify only a tag key for a
                                      condition, specify the tag key  for  the
                                      key  property  and  set this value to an
                                      empty string.

                            target -> (string)
                               The type of object to apply the condition to.

              includes -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 objects to include in the analysis.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each  property-  or
                     tag-based condition  that  determines  which  objects  to
                     include or exclude from the job. If you specify more than
                     one condition, Amazon Macie uses AND logic  to  join  the
                     conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  a  property-  or  tag-based  condition that
                        defines criteria for including or excluding S3 objects
                        from  a  classification job. A JobScopeTerm object can
                        contain  only  one  simpleScopeTerm  object   or   one
                        tagScopeTerm object.

                        simpleScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  property-based  condition  that defines a prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values for each supported property (key) are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - EQ  (equals)  or  NE  (not
                                 equals)

                               o OBJECT_KEY - STARTS_WITH

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE   -   Any  operator
                                 except CONTAINS

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - Any operator except CONTAINS

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use in the condition.

                            values -> (list)
                               An array that lists the values to  use  in  the
                               condition. If the value for the key property is
                               OBJECT_EXTENSION or OBJECT_KEY, this array  can
                               specify  multiple  values and Amazon Macie uses
                               OR logic to join the  values.  Otherwise,  this
                               array can specify only one value.

                               Valid  values for each supported property (key)
                               are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - A string  that  represents
                                 the  file  name  extension  of an object. For
                                 example: docx or pdf

                               o OBJECT_KEY - A string that represents the key
                                 prefix  (folder  name  or path) of an object.
                                 For example: logs or awslogs/eventlogs.  This
                                 value  applies  a  condition to objects whose
                                 keys (names) begin with the specified  value.

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - The date and time
                                 (in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format) when an
                                 object was created or last changed, whichever
                                 is latest. For example: 2020-09-28T14:31:13Z

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - An integer that represents  the
                                 storage size (in bytes) of an object.

                               Macie  doesn't  support use of wildcard charac-
                               ters in these values. Also, string  values  are
                               case sensitive.

                               (string)

                               The  tag keys or tag key and value pairs to use
                               in the condition. To specify only tag keys in a
                               condition,  specify  the keys in this array and
                               set the value for each associated tag value  to
                               an empty string.

                               (structure)

                                   pair to use in a tag-based  condition  that
                                   determines whether an S3 object is included
                                   or excluded from a classification job.  Tag
                                   keys  and  values are case sensitive. Also,
                                   Amazon Macie doesn't support use of partial
                                   values  or wildcard characters in tag-based
                                   conditions.

                                      ified tag key (key), to use in the  con-
                                      dition.  To specify only a tag key for a
                                      condition, specify the tag key  for  the
                                      key  property  and  set this value to an
                                      empty string.

          bucketCriteria -> (structure)
              The property- and tag-based conditions that determine  which  S3
              buckets  to  include or exclude from the analysis. Each time the
              job runs, the job uses these criteria to determine which buckets
              contain  objects  to  analyze.  A job's definition can contain a
              bucketCriteria object or a bucketDefinitions array, not both.

              excludes -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 buckets to exclude from the job.

                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each condition that
                     determines which buckets to include or exclude  from  the
                     job. If you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie
                     uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a  property-  or  tag-based  condition  that
                        defines criteria for including or excluding S3 buckets
                        from a classification job.

                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding buckets from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)

                               An  array  that lists one or more values to use
                               in the condition. If you specify multiple  val-
                               ues,  Amazon  Macie  uses  OR logic to join the
                               values. Valid values for each  supported  prop-
                               erty (key) are:

       --sampling-percentage (integer)
          The sampling depth, as a percentage, for the job to apply when  pro-
          cessing  objects.  This  value determines the percentage of eligible
          objects that the job analyzes. If this value is less than 100,  Ama-
          zon Macie selects the objects to analyze at random, up to the speci-
          fied percentage, and analyzes all the data in those objects.

       --schedule-frequency (structure)
          The recurrence pattern for running the job.  To  run  the  job  only
          once,  don't specify a value for this property and set the value for
          the jobType property to ONE_TIME.

          dailySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a daily recurrence pattern for running the job.

          monthlySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a monthly recurrence pattern for running the job.

              dayOfMonth -> (integer)
                 The numeric day of the month when Amazon Macie runs the  job.
                 This value can be an integer from 1 through 31.

                 If  this value exceeds the number of days in a certain month,
                 Macie doesn't run the job that month. Macie runs the job only
                 during  months  that  have the specified day. For example, if
                 this value is 31 and a month has only 30 days, Macie  doesn't
                 run the job that month. To run the job every month, specify a
                 value that's less than 29.

          weeklySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a weekly recurrence pattern for running the job.

              dayOfWeek -> (string)
                 The day of the week when Amazon Macie runs the job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          dailySchedule={},monthlySchedule={dayOfMonth=integer},weeklySchedule={dayOfWeek=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "dailySchedule": {

            },
            "monthlySchedule": {
              "dayOfMonth": integer

            }
          }

       --tags (map)
          A map of key-value pairs that specifies the tags to  associate  with
          the job.

          A  job can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a tag key
          and an associated tag value. The maximum length of a tag key is  128
          characters. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job.

       jobId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the job.
