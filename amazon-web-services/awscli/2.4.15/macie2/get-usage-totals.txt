GET-USAGE-TOTALS()                                          GET-USAGE-TOTALS()



NAME
       get-usage-totals -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves (queries) aggregated usage data for an account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-usage-totals
          [--time-range <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --time-range (string)
          The  inclusive  time  period  to retrieve the data for. Valid values
          are: MONTH_TO_DATE, for the current calendar  month  to  date;  and,
          PAST_30_DAYS,  for  the  preceding  30  days. If you don't specify a
          value for this parameter, Amazon  Macie  provides  aggregated  usage
          data for the preceding 30 days.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       timeRange -> (string)
          The  inclusive  time period that the usage data applies to. Possible
          values are: MONTH_TO_DATE, for the current calendar month  to  date;
          and, PAST_30_DAYS, for the preceding 30 days.

       usageTotals -> (list)
          An  array  of  objects  that contains the results of the query. Each
          object contains the data for a specific usage metric.

          (structure)
              Provides aggregated data for an Amazon Macie usage  metric.  The
              value for the metric reports estimated usage data for an account
              for the preceding 30 days or the current calendar month to date,
              depending  on  the  time  period  (timeRange)  specified  in the
              request.

              currency -> (string)
                 The type of currency that the value for the metric  (estimat-
                 edCost) is reported in.

              estimatedCost -> (string)
                 The estimated value for the metric.

              type -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  metric.  Possible values are: DATA_INVEN-
                 TORY_EVALUATION,  for  monitoring  S3  buckets;  and,  SENSI-
                 TIVE_DATA_DISCOVERY,  for analyzing S3 objects to detect sen-
                 sitive data.
