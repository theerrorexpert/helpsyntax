NAME
       describe-classification-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the status and settings for a classification job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-classification-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the classification job.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       clientToken -> (string)
          The token that was provided to ensure the idempotency of the request
          to create the job.

       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the job
          was created.

       customDataIdentifierIds -> (list)
          An  array of unique identifiers, one for each custom data identifier
          that the job uses to analyze data. This value is  null  if  the  job
          uses only managed data identifiers to analyze data.

          (string)

       description -> (string)
          The custom description of the job.

       initialRun -> (boolean)
          For  a  recurring  job,  specifies whether you configured the job to
          analyze all existing, eligible objects immediately after the job was
          created  (true).  If  you  configured  the job to analyze only those
          objects that were created or changed after the job was  created  and
          before  the  job's  first  scheduled  run, this value is false. This
          value is also false for a one-time job.

       jobArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job.

       jobId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the job.

       jobStatus -> (string)
          The current status of the job. Possible values are:

          o CANCELLED - You cancelled the job or, if it's a one-time job,  you
            paused the job and didn't resume it within 30 days.

          o COMPLETE  -  For  a one-time job, Amazon Macie finished processing
            the data specified for the job. This value doesn't apply to recur-
            ring jobs.

          o IDLE - For a recurring job, the previous scheduled run is complete
            and the next scheduled run is pending. This value doesn't apply to
            one-time jobs.

          o PAUSED  -  Macie started running the job but additional processing
            would exceed the monthly sensitive data discovery quota  for  your
            account  or one or more member accounts that the job analyzes data
            for.

          o RUNNING - For a one-time job, the job is in progress. For a recur-
            ring job, a scheduled run is in progress.

          o USER_PAUSED  -  You paused the job. If you paused the job while it
            had a status of RUNNING and you don't resume it within 30 days  of
            pausing  it,  the  job  or  job  run will expire and be cancelled,
            depending on the job's type. To check the expiration  date,  refer
            to the UserPausedDetails.jobExpiresAt property.

       jobType -> (string)
          The schedule for running the job. Possible values are:

          o ONE_TIME - The job runs only once.

          o SCHEDULED - The job runs on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The
            scheduleFrequency property indicates the  recurrence  pattern  for
            the job.

       lastRunErrorStatus -> (structure)
          Specifies   whether  any  account-  or  bucket-level  access  errors
          occurred when the job ran. For a recurring job, this value indicates
          the error status of the job's most recent run.

          code -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  any  account-  or bucket-level access errors
              occurred when the job ran. For a recurring job, this value indi-
              cates  the  error  status of the job's most recent run. Possible
              values are:

              o ERROR - One or  more  errors  occurred.  Amazon  Macie  didn't
                process all the data specified for the job.

              o NONE - No errors occurred. Macie processed all the data speci-
                fied for the job.

       lastRunTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the job
          started.  If  the  job is a recurring job, this value indicates when
          the most recent run started.

       managedDataIdentifierIds -> (list)
          An array of unique identifiers, one for each managed data identifier
          that  the  job  is explicitly configured to include (use) or exclude
          (not use) when it analyzes data. Inclusion or exclusion  depends  on
          the  managed  data  identifier  selection type specified for the job
          (managedDataIdentifierSelector). This value is  null  if  the  job's
          managed  data  identifier selection type is ALL or the job uses only
          custom data identifiers (customDataIdentifierIds) to analyze data.

          (string)

       managedDataIdentifierSelector -> (string)
          The selection type that determines which  managed  data  identifiers
          the job uses to analyze data. Possible values are:

          o ALL  - Use all the managed data identifiers that Amazon Macie pro-
            vides.

          o EXCLUDE - Use all the managed data identifiers that Macie provides
            except  the  managed  data  identifiers  specified by the managed-
            DataIdentifierIds property.

          o INCLUDE - Use only the managed data identifiers specified  by  the
            managedDataIdentifierIds property.

          o NONE - Don't use any managed data identifiers.

          If this value is null, the job uses all managed data identifiers. If
          this value is null, ALL, or EXCLUDE for a  recurring  job,  the  job
          also uses new managed data identifiers as they are released.

       name -> (string)
          The custom name of the job.

       s3JobDefinition -> (structure)
          The S3 buckets that contain the objects to analyze, and the scope of
          that analysis.

          bucketDefinitions -> (list)
              An array of objects, one for each Amazon  Web  Services  account
              that  owns specific S3 buckets to analyze. Each object specifies
              the account ID for an account and one or more buckets to analyze
              for that account. A job's definition can contain a bucketDefini-
              tions array or a bucketCriteria object, not both.

              (structure)
                 Specifies an Amazon Web Services account that owns S3 buckets
                 for a classification job to analyze, and one or more specific
                 buckets to analyze for that account.

                 accountId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account
                     that owns the buckets.

                 buckets -> (list)
                     An array that lists the names of the buckets.

                     (string)

          scoping -> (structure)
              The  property-  and tag-based conditions that determine which S3
              objects to include or exclude from the analysis. Each  time  the
              job runs, the job uses these criteria to determine which objects
              to analyze.

              excludes -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 objects to exclude from the analysis.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each  property-  or
                     tag-based condition  that  determines  which  objects  to
                     include or exclude from the job. If you specify more than
                     one condition, Amazon Macie uses AND logic  to  join  the
                     conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  a  property-  or  tag-based  condition that
                        defines criteria for including or excluding S3 objects
                        from  a  classification job. A JobScopeTerm object can
                        contain  only  one  simpleScopeTerm  object   or   one
                        tagScopeTerm object.

                        simpleScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  property-based  condition  that defines a prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values for each supported property (key) are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - EQ  (equals)  or  NE  (not
                                 equals)

                               o OBJECT_KEY - STARTS_WITH

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE   -   Any  operator
                                 except CONTAINS

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - Any operator except CONTAINS

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use in the condition.

                            values -> (list)
                               An array that lists the values to  use  in  the
                               condition. If the value for the key property is
                               OBJECT_EXTENSION or OBJECT_KEY, this array  can
                               specify  multiple  values and Amazon Macie uses
                               OR logic to join the  values.  Otherwise,  this
                               array can specify only one value.

                               Valid  values for each supported property (key)
                               are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - A string  that  represents
                                 the  file  name  extension  of an object. For
                                 example: docx or pdf

                               o OBJECT_KEY - A string that represents the key
                                 prefix  (folder  name  or path) of an object.
                                 For example: logs or awslogs/eventlogs.  This
                                 value  applies  a  condition to objects whose
                                 keys (names) begin with the specified  value.

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - The date and time
                                 (in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format) when an
                                 object was created or last changed, whichever
                                 is latest. For example: 2020-09-28T14:31:13Z

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - An integer that represents  the
                                 storage size (in bytes) of an object.

                               Macie  doesn't  support use of wildcard charac-
                               ters in these values. Also, string  values  are
                               case sensitive.

                               (string)

                        tagScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  tag-based  condition  that defines the operator
                            and tag keys  or  tag  key  and  value  pairs  for
                            including or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values are EQ (equals) or NE (not equals).

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use  in  the  condition.
                               The only valid value is TAG.

                            tagValues -> (list)
                               The  tag keys or tag key and value pairs to use
                               in the condition. To specify only tag keys in a
                               condition,  specify  the keys in this array and
                               set the value for each associated tag value  to
                               an empty string.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  a  tag  key or tag key and value
                                   pair to use in a tag-based  condition  that
                                   determines whether an S3 object is included
                                   or excluded from a classification job.  Tag
                                   keys  and  values are case sensitive. Also,
                                   Amazon Macie doesn't support use of partial
                                   values  or wildcard characters in tag-based
                                   conditions.

                                   key -> (string)
                                      The value for the tag key to use in  the
                                      condition.

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The tag value, associated with the spec-
                                      ified tag key (key), to use in the  con-
                                      dition.  To specify only a tag key for a
                                      condition, specify the tag key  for  the
                                      key  property  and  set this value to an
                                      empty string.

                            target -> (string)
                               The type of object to apply the condition to.

              includes -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 objects to include in the analysis.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each  property-  or
                     tag-based condition  that  determines  which  objects  to
                     include or exclude from the job. If you specify more than
                     one condition, Amazon Macie uses AND logic  to  join  the
                     conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  a  property-  or  tag-based  condition that
                        defines criteria for including or excluding S3 objects
                        from  a  classification job. A JobScopeTerm object can
                        contain  only  one  simpleScopeTerm  object   or   one
                        tagScopeTerm object.

                        simpleScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  property-based  condition  that defines a prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values for each supported property (key) are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - EQ  (equals)  or  NE  (not
                                 equals)

                               o OBJECT_KEY - STARTS_WITH

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE   -   Any  operator

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - Any operator except CONTAINS

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use in the condition.

                            values -> (list)
                               An array that lists the values to  use  in  the
                               condition. If the value for the key property is
                               OBJECT_EXTENSION or OBJECT_KEY, this array  can
                               specify  multiple  values and Amazon Macie uses
                               OR logic to join the  values.  Otherwise,  this
                               array can specify only one value.

                               Valid  values for each supported property (key)
                               are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - A string  that  represents
                                 the  file  name  extension  of an object. For
                                 example: docx or pdf

                               o OBJECT_KEY - A string that represents the key
                                 prefix  (folder  name  or path) of an object.
                                 For example: logs or awslogs/eventlogs.  This
                                 value  applies  a  condition to objects whose
                                 keys (names) begin with the specified  value.

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - The date and time
                                 (in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format) when an
                                 object was created or last changed, whichever
                                 is latest. For example: 2020-09-28T14:31:13Z

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - An integer that represents  the
                                 storage size (in bytes) of an object.

                               Macie  doesn't  support use of wildcard charac-
                               ters in these values. Also, string  values  are
                               case sensitive.

                               (string)

                        tagScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  tag-based  condition  that defines the operator
                            and tag keys  or  tag  key  and  value  pairs  for
                            including or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values are EQ (equals) or NE (not equals).

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use  in  the  condition.
                               The only valid value is TAG.

                            tagValues -> (list)
                               The  tag keys or tag key and value pairs to use
                               in the condition. To specify only tag keys in a
                               condition,  specify  the keys in this array and
                               set the value for each associated tag value  to
                               an empty string.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  a  tag  key or tag key and value
                                   pair to use in a tag-based  condition  that
                                   determines whether an S3 object is included
                                   or excluded from a classification job.  Tag
                                   keys  and  values are case sensitive. Also,
                                   Amazon Macie doesn't support use of partial
                                   values  or wildcard characters in tag-based
                                   conditions.

                                   key -> (string)
                                      The value for the tag key to use in  the
                                      condition.

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The tag value, associated with the spec-
                                      ified tag key (key), to use in the  con-
                                      dition.  To specify only a tag key for a
                                      condition, specify the tag key  for  the
                                      key  property  and  set this value to an
                                      empty string.

                            target -> (string)
                               The type of object to apply the condition to.

          bucketCriteria -> (structure)
              The property- and tag-based conditions that determine  which  S3
              buckets  to  include or exclude from the analysis. Each time the
              job runs, the job uses these criteria to determine which buckets
              contain  objects  to  analyze.  A job's definition can contain a
              bucketCriteria object or a bucketDefinitions array, not both.

              excludes -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 buckets to exclude from the job.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each condition that
                     determines which buckets to include or exclude  from  the
                     job. If you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie
                     uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a  property-  or  tag-based  condition  that
                        defines criteria for including or excluding S3 buckets
                        from a classification job.

                        simpleCriterion -> (structure)
                            A property-based condition that  defines  a  prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding buckets from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The operator to use  in  the  condition.  Valid
                               values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                            key -> (string)
                               The property to use in the condition.

                            values -> (list)
                               An  array  that lists one or more values to use
                               in the condition. If you specify multiple  val-
                               ues,  Amazon  Macie  uses  OR logic to join the
                               values. Valid values for each  supported  prop-
                               erty (key) are:

                               o ACCOUNT_ID  -  A  string  that represents the
                                 unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services
                                 account that owns the bucket.

                               o S3_BUCKET_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSION   -  A  string
                                 that  represents  an  enumerated  value  that
                                 Macie         defines         for         the
                                 BucketPublicAccess.effectivePermission  prop-
                                 erty of a bucket.

                               o S3_BUCKET_NAME - A string that represents the
                                 name of a bucket.

                               o S3_BUCKET_SHARED_ACCESS - A string that  rep-
                                 resents   an   enumerated  value  that  Macie

                                 property of a bucket.

                               Values  are case sensitive. Also, Macie doesn't
                               support use of partial values or wildcard char-
                               acters in these values.

                                   an S3 bucket is included or excluded from a
                                   classification job. Tag keys and values are
                                   case  sensitive. Also, Amazon Macie doesn't
                                   support use of partial values  or  wildcard
                                   characters in tag-based conditions.

                                   key -> (string)
                                      The  value for the tag key to use in the
                                      condition.

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The tag value to use in the condition.

       samplingPercentage -> (integer)
          The sampling depth, as a percentage, that determines the  percentage
          of eligible objects that the job analyzes.

       scheduleFrequency -> (structure)
          The  recurrence  pattern  for running the job. This value is null if
          the job is configured to run only once.

          dailySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a daily recurrence pattern for running the job.

          monthlySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a monthly recurrence pattern for running the job.

              dayOfMonth -> (integer)
                 The numeric day of the month when Amazon Macie runs the  job.
                 This value can be an integer from 1 through 31.

                 If  this value exceeds the number of days in a certain month,
                 Macie doesn't run the job that month. Macie runs the job only
                 during  months  that  have the specified day. For example, if
                 this value is 31 and a month has only 30 days, Macie  doesn't
                 run the job that month. To run the job every month, specify a
                 value that's less than 29.

          weeklySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a weekly recurrence pattern for running the job.

              dayOfWeek -> (string)
                 The day of the week when Amazon Macie runs the job.

       statistics -> (structure)
          The number of times that the job has run and  processing  statistics
          for the job's current run.

          approximateNumberOfObjectsToProcess -> (double)
              The  approximate  number  of  objects  that  the  job has yet to
              process during its current run.

          numberOfRuns -> (double)
              The number of times that the job has run.

       tags -> (map)
          A map of key-value pairs that specifies which tags (keys and values)
          are associated with the classification job.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       userPausedDetails -> (structure)
          If  the current status of the job is USER_PAUSED, specifies when the
          job was paused and when the job or job run will expire and  be  can-
          celled  if it isn't resumed. This value is present only if the value
          for jobStatus is USER_PAUSED.

          jobExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the
              job  or job run will expire and be cancelled if you don't resume
              it first.

          jobImminentExpirationHealthEventArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Health event  that  Amazon
              Macie sent to notify you of the job or job run's pending expira-
              tion and cancellation. This value is null  if  a  job  has  been
              paused for less than 23 days.

          jobPausedAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when you
              paused the job.
