SEARCH-RESOURCES()                                          SEARCH-RESOURCES()



NAME
       search-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves (queries) statistical data and other information about Amazon
       Web Services resources that Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: matchingResources

OPTIONS
       --bucket-criteria (structure)
          The  filter conditions that determine which S3 buckets to include or
          exclude from the query results.

          excludes -> (structure)
              The property- and  tag-based  conditions  that  determine  which
              buckets to exclude from the results.

              and -> (list)
                 An array of objects, one for each property- or tag-based con-
                 dition that includes or excludes  resources  from  the  query
                 results. If you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie
                 uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a property- or tag-based filter  condition  for
                     including or excluding Amazon Web Services resources from
                     the query results.

                     simpleCriterion -> (structure)
                        A property-based condition that  defines  a  property,
                        operator,  and  one  or  more  values for including or
                        excluding resources from the results.

                        comparator -> (string)
                            The operator to use in the condition. Valid values
                            are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                        key -> (string)
                            The property to use in the condition.

                        values -> (list)
                            An  array  that lists one or more values to use in
                            the condition. If  you  specify  multiple  values,
                            Amazon  Macie  uses  OR  logic to join the values.
                            Valid values for  each  supported  property  (key)
                            are:

                            o ACCOUNT_ID - A string that represents the unique
                              identifier for the Amazon Web  Services  account
                              that owns the resource.

                              represents  an  enumerated  value   that   Macie
                              defines                  for                 the
                              BucketPublicAccess.effectivePermission  property
                              of an S3 bucket.

                            o S3_BUCKET_NAME  -  A  string that represents the
                              name of an S3 bucket.

                            o S3_BUCKET_SHARED_ACCESS - A string  that  repre-
                              sents an enumerated value that Macie defines for
                              the BucketMetadata.sharedAccess property  of  an
                              S3 bucket.

                            Values  are  case  sensitive.  Also, Macie doesn't
                            support use of partial values or wildcard  charac-
                            ters in values.

                               and value (as a pair) to  use  in  a  tag-based
                               filter condition for a query. Tag keys and val-
                               ues are  case  sensitive.  Also,  Amazon  Macie
                               doesn't  support use of partial values or wild-
                               card characters in tag-based filter conditions.

                 dition that includes or excludes  resources  from  the  query
                 results. If you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie
                 uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a property- or tag-based filter  condition  for
                     including or excluding Amazon Web Services resources from

                               ues are  case  sensitive.  Also,  Amazon  Macie
                               doesn't  support use of partial values or wild-

          The criteria to use to sort the results.

          attributeName -> (string)
              The property to sort the results by.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The sort order to apply to the results, based on the  value  for

          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     in the bucket. These  objects  use  a  supported  storage
                     class and have a file name extension for a supported file
                     or storage format.

                 classifiableSizeInBytes -> (long)
                     The total storage size, in bytes,  of  the  objects  that
                     Amazon Macie can analyze in the bucket. These objects use
                     a supported storage class and have a file name  extension
                     for a supported file or storage format.

                     If versioning is enabled for the bucket, Macie calculates
                     this value based on the size of  the  latest  version  of
                     each  applicable object in the bucket. This value doesn't
                     reflect the storage size of all versions of each applica-
                     ble object in the bucket.

                 errorCode -> (string)
                     Specifies the error code for an error that prevented Ama-
                     zon Macie  from  retrieving  and  processing  information
                     about  the bucket and the bucket's objects. If this value
                     is  ACCESS_DENIED,  Macie  doesn't  have  permission   to
                     retrieve  the  information. For example, the bucket has a
                     restrictive  bucket  policy  and  Amazon  S3  denied  the
                     request.  If  this  value  is  null,  Macie  was  able to
                     retrieve and process the information.

                 errorMessage -> (string)
                     A brief description of the error  (errorCode)  that  pre-
                     vented Amazon Macie from retrieving and processing infor-
                     mation about the bucket and the  bucket's  objects.  This
                     value  is  null if Macie was able to retrieve and process
                     the information.

                 jobDetails -> (structure)
                     Specifies whether any one-time or  recurring  classifica-
                     tion  jobs  are  configured  to  analyze  objects  in the
                     bucket, and, if so, the details of the job that ran  most
                     recently.

                     isDefinedInJob -> (string)
                        Specifies  whether  any one-time or recurring jobs are
                        configured to analyze data  in  the  bucket.  Possible
                        values are:

                        o TRUE  -  The  bucket  is  explicitly included in the
                          bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for one
                          or  more  jobs  and at least one of those jobs has a
                          status other than CANCELLED. Or the  bucket  matched
                          the  bucket criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for at
                          least one job that previously ran.

                        o FALSE - The bucket isn't explicitly included in  the
                          bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for any
                          jobs, all  the  jobs  that  explicitly  include  the
                          bucket  in their bucket definitions have a status of
                          CANCELLED, or the bucket  didn't  match  the  bucket
                          criteria  (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for any jobs that
                          previously ran.

                        o UNKNOWN - An exception occurred  when  Amazon  Macie
                          attempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.

                     isMonitoredByJob -> (string)
                        Specifies whether any recurring jobs are configured to
                        analyze data in the bucket. Possible values are:

                        o TRUE - The bucket  is  explicitly  included  in  the
                          bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for one
                          or more recurring jobs or  the  bucket  matches  the
                          bucket  criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for one or
                          more recurring jobs. At least one of those jobs  has
                          a status other than CANCELLED.

                        o FALSE  - The bucket isn't explicitly included in the
                          bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for any
                          recurring  jobs, the bucket doesn't match the bucket
                          criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for any  recurring
                          jobs,  or all the recurring jobs that are configured
                          to analyze data in the bucket have a status of  CAN-
                          CELLED.

                        o UNKNOWN  -  An  exception occurred when Amazon Macie
                          attempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.

                     lastJobId -> (string)
                        The unique  identifier  for  the  job  that  ran  most
                        recently  and  is  configured  to  analyze data in the
                        bucket, either the latest run of a  recurring  job  or
                        the only run of a one-time job.

                        This  value  is  typically  null  if the value for the
                        isDefinedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

                     lastJobRunTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO  8601  for-
                        mat, when the job (lastJobId) started. If the job is a
                        recurring job, this  value  indicates  when  the  most
                        recent run started.

                        This  value  is  typically  null  if the value for the
                        isDefinedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

                 objectCount -> (long)
                     The total number of objects in the bucket.

                 objectCountByEncryptionType -> (structure)
                     The total number of  objects  that  are  in  the  bucket,
                     grouped  by  server-side encryption type. This includes a
                     grouping that reports the total number  of  objects  that
                     aren't encrypted or use client-side encryption.

                     customerManaged -> (long)
                        The  total number of objects that are encrypted with a
                        customer-provided key. The objects  use  customer-pro-
                        vided server-side encryption (SSE-C).

                     kmsManaged -> (long)
                        The total number of objects that are encrypted with an
                        KMS key, either an Amazon Web Services managed key  or
                        a customer managed key. The objects use KMS encryption
                        (SSE-KMS).

                     s3Managed -> (long)
                        The total number of objects that are encrypted with an
                        Amazon  S3 managed key. The objects use Amazon S3 man-
                        aged encryption (SSE-S3).

                     unencrypted -> (long)
                        The total number of objects that aren't  encrypted  or
                        use client-side encryption.

                     unknown -> (long)
                        The  total number of objects that Amazon Macie doesn't
                        have current encryption metadata for. Macie can't pro-
                        vide  current  data  about the encryption settings for
                        these objects.

                 sizeInBytes -> (long)
                     The total storage size, in bytes, of the bucket.

                     If versioning is enabled for  the  bucket,  Amazon  Macie
                     calculates  this  value  based  on the size of the latest
                     version of each object in the bucket. This value  doesn't
                     reflect  the  storage size of all versions of each object
                     in the bucket.

                 sizeInBytesCompressed -> (long)
                     The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that are
                     compressed (.gz, .gzip, .zip) files in the bucket.

                     If  versioning  is  enabled  for the bucket, Amazon Macie
                     calculates this value based on the  size  of  the  latest
                     version  of  each  applicable  object in the bucket. This
                     value doesn't reflect the storage size of all versions of
                     each applicable object in the bucket.

                 unclassifiableObjectCount -> (structure)
                     The  total number of objects that Amazon Macie can't ana-
                     lyze in the bucket. These objects don't use  a  supported
                     storage  class  or don't have a file name extension for a
                     supported file or storage format.

                     fileType -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that  Amazon  Macie  can't analyze because the objects
                        don't have a file name extension for a supported  file
                        or storage format.

                     storageClass -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that Amazon Macie can't analyze  because  the  objects
                        use an unsupported storage class.

                     total -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that Amazon Macie can't analyze  because  the  objects
                        use  an unsupported storage class or don't have a file
                        name extension for a supported file or storage format.

                 unclassifiableObjectSizeInBytes -> (structure)
                     The  total  storage  size,  in bytes, of the objects that
                     Amazon Macie can't analyze in the bucket.  These  objects
                     don't  use a supported storage class or don't have a file
                     name extension for a supported file or storage format.

                     fileType -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that  Amazon  Macie  can't analyze because the objects
                        don't have a file name extension for a supported  file
                        or storage format.

                     storageClass -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that Amazon Macie can't analyze  because  the  objects
                        use an unsupported storage class.

                     total -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that Amazon Macie can't analyze  because  the  objects
                        use  an unsupported storage class or don't have a file
                        name extension for a supported file or storage format.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  string  to  use in a subsequent request to get the next page of
          results in a paginated response. This value is null if there are  no
