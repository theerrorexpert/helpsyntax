DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service
       that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect
       your  sensitive data in AWS. Macie automates the discovery of sensitive
       data, such as PII  and  intellectual  property,  to  provide  you  with
       insight  into the data that your organization stores in AWS. Macie also
       provides an inventory of your Amazon S3 buckets, which  it  continually
       monitors  for  you.  If  Macie detects sensitive data or potential data
       access issues, it generates detailed findings for you to review and act
       upon as necessary.
