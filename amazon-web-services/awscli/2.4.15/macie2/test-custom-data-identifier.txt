TEST-CUSTOM-DATA-IDENTIFIER()                    TEST-CUSTOM-DATA-IDENTIFIER()



NAME
       test-custom-data-identifier -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests a custom data identifier.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            test-custom-data-identifier
          [--ignore-words <value>]
          [--keywords <value>]
          [--maximum-match-distance <value>]
          --regex <value>
          --sample-text <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ignore-words (list)
          An  array that lists specific character sequences (ignore words ) to
          exclude from the results. If the text matched by the regular expres-
          sion contains any string in this array, Amazon Macie ignores it. The
          array can contain as many as 10 ignore words. Each ignore  word  can
          contain 4-90 UTF-8 characters. Ignore words are case sensitive.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --keywords (list)
          An array that lists specific character sequences (keywords ), one of
          which must be within proximity (maximumMatchDistance) of the regular
          expression  to  match. The array can contain as many as 50 keywords.
          Each keyword can contain 3-90 UTF-8 characters. Keywords aren't case
          sensitive.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --maximum-match-distance (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of characters that can exist between text that
          matches the regular expression and the character sequences specified
          by  the  keywords  array. Amazon Macie includes or excludes a result
          based on the proximity of a keyword to text that matches the regular
          expression.  The distance can be 1-300 characters. The default value
          is 50.

       --regex (string)
          The regular expression (regex ) that defines the pattern  to  match.
          The expression can contain as many as 512 characters.

       --sample-text (string)
          The  sample text to inspect by using the custom data identifier. The
          text can contain as many as 1,000 characters.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       matchCount -> (integer)
          The number of occurrences of sample text that matched  the  criteria
          specified by the custom data identifier.
