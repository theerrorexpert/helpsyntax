LIST-CLASSIFICATION-JOBS()                          LIST-CLASSIFICATION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-classification-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  subset  of  information  about one or more classification
       jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-classification-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: items

OPTIONS
       --filter-criteria (structure)
          The criteria to use to filter the results.

          excludes -> (list)
              An  array  of  objects,  one  for each condition that determines
              which jobs to exclude from the results.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a condition that filters the results of  a  request
                 for  information  about  classification  jobs. Each condition
                 consists of a property, an operator, and one or more  values.

                 comparator -> (string)
                     The operator to use to filter the results.

                 key -> (string)
                     The property to use to filter the results.

                 values -> (list)
                     An  array  that lists one or more values to use to filter
                     the results.

          includes -> (list)
              An array of objects, one  for  each  condition  that  determines
              which jobs to include in the results.

              (structure)
                 Specifies  a  condition that filters the results of a request
                 for information about  classification  jobs.  Each  condition
                 consists  of a property, an operator, and one or more values.

                 comparator -> (string)
                     The operator to use to filter the results.

                 key -> (string)
                     The property to use to filter the results.

                 values -> (list)
                     An array that lists one or more values to use  to  filter
                     the results.

                     (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "excludes": [
              {
                "comparator": "EQ"|"GT"|"GTE"|"LT"|"LTE"|"NE"|"CONTAINS"|"STARTS_WITH",
                "key": "jobType"|"jobStatus"|"createdAt"|"name",
                "values": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ],
            "includes": [
              {
                "comparator": "EQ"|"GT"|"GTE"|"LT"|"LTE"|"NE"|"CONTAINS"|"STARTS_WITH",
                "key": "jobType"|"jobStatus"|"createdAt"|"name",
                "values": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          The criteria to use to sort the results.

          attributeName -> (string)
              The property to sort the results by.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The  sort  order to apply to the results, based on the value for
              the property specified by the attributeName property. Valid val-
              ues  are:  ASC,  sort the results in ascending order; and, DESC,
              sort the results in descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributeName=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributeName": "createdAt"|"jobStatus"|"name"|"jobType",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       items -> (list)
          An array of objects, one for each job that meets the filter criteria
          specified in the request.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a classification job,  including  the
              current status of the job.

              bucketDefinitions -> (list)
                 An array of objects, one for each Amazon Web Services account
                 that owns specific S3 buckets for the job  to  analyze.  Each
                 object  specifies  the  account  ID for an account and one or
                 more buckets to analyze for that account. A job's  definition
                 can  contain  a  bucketDefinitions  array or a bucketCriteria
                 object, not both.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies an Amazon Web Services  account  that  owns  S3
                     buckets  for  a classification job to analyze, and one or
                     more specific buckets to analyze for that account.

                     accountId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier  for  the  Amazon  Web  Services
                        account that owns the buckets.

                     buckets -> (list)
                        An array that lists the names of the buckets.

                        (string)

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when
                 the job was created.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the job.

              jobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the job. Possible values are:

                 o CANCELLED - You cancelled the job or, if  it's  a  one-time
                   job,  you  paused  the  job  and didn't resume it within 30
                   days.

                 o COMPLETE - For a one-time job, Amazon Macie  finished  pro-
                   cessing  the data specified for the job. This value doesn't
                   apply to recurring jobs.

                 o IDLE - For a recurring job, the previous scheduled  run  is
                   complete  and the next scheduled run is pending. This value
                   doesn't apply to one-time jobs.

                 o PAUSED - Macie started running the job but additional  pro-
                   cessing  would  exceed the monthly sensitive data discovery
                   quota for your account or one or more member accounts  that
                   the job analyzes data for.

                 o RUNNING - For a one-time job, the job is in progress. For a
                   recurring job, a scheduled run is in progress.

                 o USER_PAUSED - You paused the job. If  you  paused  the  job
                   while  it  had  a status of RUNNING and you don't resume it
                   within 30 days of pausing it,  the  job  or  job  run  will
                   expire  and  be  cancelled, depending on the job's type. To
                   check the  expiration  date,  refer  to  the  UserPausedDe-
                   tails.jobExpiresAt property.

              jobType -> (string)
                 The schedule for running the job. Possible values are:

                 o ONE_TIME - The job runs only once.

                 o SCHEDULED  -  The  job  runs on a daily, weekly, or monthly
                   basis.

              lastRunErrorStatus -> (structure)
                 Specifies whether any account- or bucket-level access  errors
                 occurred  when  the  job ran. For a recurring job, this value
                 indicates the error status of the job's most recent run.

                 code -> (string)
                     Specifies whether any  account-  or  bucket-level  access
                     errors  occurred  when  the job ran. For a recurring job,
                     this value indicates the error status of the  job's  most
                     recent run. Possible values are:

                     o ERROR  -  One  or  more  errors  occurred. Amazon Macie
                       didn't process all the data specified for the job.

                     o NONE - No errors occurred. Macie processed all the data
                       specified for the job.

              name -> (string)
                 The custom name of the job.

              userPausedDetails -> (structure)
                 If  the  current  status of the job is USER_PAUSED, specifies
                 when the job was paused and when the  job  or  job  run  will
                 expire  and  be  cancelled if it isn't resumed. This value is
                 present only if the value for jobStatus is USER_PAUSED.

                 jobExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO  8601  format,
                     when  the  job or job run will expire and be cancelled if
                     you don't resume it first.

                 jobImminentExpirationHealthEventArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Health  event  that
                     Amazon  Macie  sent to notify you of the job or job run's
                     pending expiration and cancellation. This value  is  null
                     if a job has been paused for less than 23 days.

                 jobPausedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,
                     when you paused the job.

              bucketCriteria -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 S3  buckets are included or excluded from the job's analysis.
                 Each time the job runs, the job uses these criteria to deter-
                 mine which buckets to analyze. A job's definition can contain
                 a bucketCriteria object or  a  bucketDefinitions  array,  not
                 both.

                 excludes -> (structure)
                     The  property-  and  tag-based  conditions that determine
                     which buckets to exclude from the job.

                     and -> (list)
                        An array of conditions, one for  each  condition  that
                        determines  which  buckets  to include or exclude from
                        the job. If you specify more than one condition,  Ama-
                        zon Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  a property- or tag-based condition that
                            defines criteria for  including  or  excluding  S3
                            buckets from a classification job.

                            simpleCriterion -> (structure)
                               A property-based condition that defines a prop-
                               erty, operator, and  one  or  more  values  for
                               including or excluding buckets from the job.

                               comparator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use in the condition. Valid
                                   values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                               key -> (string)
                                   The property to use in the condition.

                               values -> (list)
                                   An  array  that lists one or more values to
                                   use in the condition. If you specify multi-
                                   ple  values,  Amazon Macie uses OR logic to
                                   join the values. Valid values for each sup-
                                   ported property (key) are:

                                   o ACCOUNT_ID - A string that represents the
                                     unique identifier for the Amazon Web Ser-
                                     vices account that owns the bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSION - A string
                                     that represents an enumerated value  that
                                     Macie        defines        for       the
                                     BucketPublicAccess.effectivePermission
                                     property of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_NAME - A string that represents
                                     the name of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_SHARED_ACCESS - A  string  that
                                     represents an enumerated value that Macie
                                     defines              for              the
                                     BucketMetadata.sharedAccess property of a
                                     bucket.

                                   Values  are  case  sensitive.  Also,  Macie
                                   doesn't  support  use  of partial values or
                                   wildcard characters in these values.

                                   (string)

                            tagCriterion -> (structure)
                               A tag-based condition that defines an  operator
                               and  tag keys, tag values, or tag key and value
                               pairs for including or excluding  buckets  from
                               the job.

                               comparator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use in the condition. Valid
                                   values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                               tagValues -> (list)
                                   The  tag  keys,  tag values, or tag key and
                                   value pairs to use in the condition.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a tag key, a tag value,  or  a
                                      tag  key and value (as a pair) to use in
                                      a tag-based  condition  that  determines
                                      whether  an  S3  bucket  is  included or
                                      excluded from a classification job.  Tag
                                      keys  and  values  are  case  sensitive.
                                      Also, Amazon Macie doesn't  support  use
                                      of partial values or wildcard characters
                                      in tag-based conditions.

                                          the condition.

                                      value -> (string)
                                          The  tag  value to use in the condi-
                                          tion.

                 includes -> (structure)
                     The property- and  tag-based  conditions  that  determine
                     which buckets to include in the job.

                     and -> (list)
                        An  array  of  conditions, one for each condition that
                        determines which buckets to include  or  exclude  from
                        the  job. If you specify more than one condition, Ama-
                        zon Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a property- or tag-based condition  that
                            defines  criteria  for  including  or excluding S3
                            buckets from a classification job.

                            simpleCriterion -> (structure)
                               A property-based condition that defines a prop-
                               erty,  operator,  and  one  or  more values for
                               including or excluding buckets from the job.

                               comparator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use in the condition. Valid
                                   values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                               key -> (string)
                                   The property to use in the condition.

                                   An array that lists one or more  values  to
                                   use in the condition. If you specify multi-
                                   ple values, Amazon Macie uses OR  logic  to
                                   join the values. Valid values for each sup-
                                   ported property (key) are:

                                   o ACCOUNT_ID - A string that represents the
                                     unique identifier for the Amazon Web Ser-
                                     vices account that owns the bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSION - A string
                                     that  represents an enumerated value that
                                     Macie       defines        for        the
                                     BucketPublicAccess.effectivePermission
                                     property of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_NAME - A string that represents
                                     the name of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_SHARED_ACCESS  -  A string that
                                     represents an enumerated value that Macie
                                     defines              for              the
                                     BucketMetadata.sharedAccess property of a
                                     bucket.

                                   Values  are  case  sensitive.  Also,  Macie
                                   doesn't support use of  partial  values  or
                                   wildcard characters in these values.

                                      a  tag-based  condition  that determines
                                      whether an  S3  bucket  is  included  or
                                      excluded  from a classification job. Tag
                                      keys  and  values  are  case  sensitive.
                                      Also,  Amazon  Macie doesn't support use
                                      of partial values or wildcard characters
