CHANGE-MESSAGE-VISIBILITY()                        CHANGE-MESSAGE-VISIBILITY()



NAME
       change-message-visibility -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a
       new value. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30  seconds.
       The  minimum  is  0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more informa-
       tion, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes.
       After  3 minutes, you call ChangeMessageVisibility with a timeout of 10
       minutes. You can continue to call ChangeMessageVisibility to extend the
       visibility  timeout  to  the maximum allowed time. If you try to extend
       the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected.

       An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:

       o Sent to a queue by a producer.

       o Received from the queue by a consumer.

       o Deleted from the queue.

       A message is considered to be stored after it is sent to a queue  by  a
       producer,  but  not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is,
       between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored mes-
       sages.  A  message  is  considered to be in flight after it is received
       from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from  the  queue  (that
       is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of inflight
       messages.

       Limits that apply to inflight messages are unrelated to  the  unlimited
       number of stored messages.

       For  most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message back-
       log), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 inflight messages
       (received  from  a  queue  by  a consumer, but not yet deleted from the
       queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the OverLimit error
       message.  To  avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from
       the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number  of
       queues  you  use to process your messages. To request a limit increase,
       file a support request .

       For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum  of  20,000  inflight  messages
       (received  from  a  queue  by  a consumer, but not yet deleted from the
       queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error  messages.

       WARNING:
          If  you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to a value greater than
          the maximum time left, Amazon  SQS  returns  an  error.  Amazon  SQS
          doesn't  automatically  recalculate  and increase the timeout to the
          maximum remaining time.

          Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility  timeout  for  a
          specific  message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't
          saved in memory for that message. If  you  don't  delete  a  message
          after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts
          to the original timeout value (not to the value you  set  using  the
          ChangeMessageVisibility   action)  the  next  time  the  message  is
          received.

SYNOPSIS
            change-message-visibility
          --queue-url <value>
          --receipt-handle <value>
          --visibility-timeout <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the  Amazon  SQS  queue  whose  message's  visibility  is
          changed.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --receipt-handle (string)
          The  receipt  handle  associated  with  the message whose visibility
          timeout  is  changed.  This  parameter  is  returned   by   the   ``
          ReceiveMessage `` action.

       --visibility-timeout (integer)
          The  new  value  for  the message's visibility timeout (in seconds).
          Values range: 0 to 43200 . Maximum: 12 hours.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change a message's timeout visibility

       This example changes the specified message's timeout visibility  to  10
       hours (10 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds).

       Command:

          aws sqs change-message-visibility --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue --receipt-handle AQEBTpyI...t6HyQg== --visibility-timeout 36000

       Output:

          None.

OUTPUT
       None
