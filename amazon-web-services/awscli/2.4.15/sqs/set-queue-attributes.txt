SET-QUEUE-ATTRIBUTES()                                  SET-QUEUE-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       set-queue-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the  value  of  one  or  more queue attributes. When you change a
       queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds  for  most  of
       the  attributes  to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes
       made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes.

       NOTE:

          o In  the  future,  new attributes might be added. If you write code
            that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your  code
            so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

          o Cross-account  permissions  don't  apply  to this action. For more
            information, see Grant cross-account permissions to a role  and  a
            user name in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          o To  remove  the ability to change queue permissions, you must deny
            permission  to  the  AddPermission  ,   RemovePermission   ,   and
            SetQueueAttributes actions in your IAM policy.

SYNOPSIS
            set-queue-attributes
          --queue-url <value>
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue whose attributes are set.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of attributes to set.

          The  following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the spe-
          cial request parameters that the SetQueueAttributes action uses:

          o DelaySeconds  The length of time, in seconds, for which the deliv-
            ery  of  all  messages  in  the queue is delayed. Valid values: An
            integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0.

          o MaximumMessageSize  The limit of how many bytes a message can con-
            tain  before  Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from
            1,024 bytes (1 KiB)  up  to  262,144  bytes  (256  KiB).  Default:
            262,144 (256 KiB).

          o MessageRetentionPeriod   The length of time, in seconds, for which
            Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer  represent-
            ing  seconds,  from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days). Default:
            345,600 (4 days).

          o Policy  The queue's policy. A valid Amazon  Web  Services  policy.
            For  more information about policy structure, see Overview of Ama-
            zon Web Services IAM Policies in the Identity and  Access  Manage-
            ment User Guide .

          o ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds  The length of time, in seconds, for
            which a ``  ReceiveMessage  ``  action  waits  for  a  message  to
            arrive.  Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default:
            0.

          o RedrivePolicy  The string that includes  the  parameters  for  the
            dead-letter  queue  functionality  of  the  source queue as a JSON
            object.  For  more  information  about  the  redrive  policy   and
            dead-letter queues, see Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues in the
            Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

            o deadLetterTargetArn  The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
              dead-letter  queue  to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the
              value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.

            o maxReceiveCount  The number of times a message is  delivered  to
              the  source  queue  before being moved to the dead-letter queue.
              When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the  maxReceiveCount
              for  a  queue,  Amazon  SQS  moves  the message to the dead-let-
              ter-queue.

          NOTE:
              The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue.
              Similarly,  the  dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also
              be a standard queue.

          o VisibilityTimeout  The visibility timeout for the queue,  in  sec-
            onds.  Valid  values:  An  integer  from  0  to 43,200 (12 hours).
            Default: 30. For more information about  the  visibility  timeout,
            see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId   The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer
            master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more informa-
            tion,  see  Key Terms . While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for
            Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs , the alias  of  a  custom  CMK
            can, for example, be
            ``
            alias/MyAlias `` . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Manage-
            ment Service API Reference .

          o KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds  The length of time, in seconds,  for
            which  Amazon  SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt mes-
            sages before calling KMS again. An integer  representing  seconds,
            between  60  seconds  (1  minute)  and  86,400 seconds (24 hours).
            Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time  period  provides  better
            security  but  results  in  more  calls  to  KMS which might incur
            charges after Free Tier. For more information, see  How  Does  the
            Data Key Reuse Period Work? .

          o SqsManagedSseEnabled   Enables  server-side queue encryption using
            SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption  option
            is supported per queue (e.g. SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS ).

          The  following  attribute  applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out)
          queues :

          o ContentBasedDeduplication   Enables  content-based  deduplication.
            For  more  information,  see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon
            SQS Developer Guide . Note the following:

            o Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId .

              o You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.

              o If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you
                enable  ContentBasedDeduplication  for  your queue, Amazon SQS
                uses a SHA-256 hash  to  generate  the  MessageDeduplicationId
                using  the  body of the message (but not the attributes of the
                message).

              o If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId  and  the  queue
                doesn't  have  ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails
                with an error.

              o If the queue has ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageD-
                eduplicationId overrides the generated one.

            o When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with iden-
              tical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated
              as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.

            o If  you  send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled
              and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId  that  is
              the  same  as  the one generated for the first MessageDeduplica-
              tionId , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one
              copy of the message is delivered.

          The  following  attributes  apply  only  to high throughput for FIFO
          queues :

          o DeduplicationScope  Specifies whether message deduplication occurs
            at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup
            and queue .

          o FifoThroughputLimit  Specifies whether the FIFO  queue  throughput
            quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid val-
            ues are perQueue and  perMessageGroupId  .  The  perMessageGroupId
            value  is  allowed  only  when the value for DeduplicationScope is
            messageGroup .

          To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

          o Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup .

          o Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId .

          If you set these attributes to anything other than the values  shown
          for  enabling  high  throughput,  normal throughput is in effect and
          deduplication occurs as specified.

          For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages
          in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To set queue attributes

       This  example  sets  the specified queue to a delivery delay of 10 sec-
       onds, a maximum message size of 128 KB (128 KB * 1,024 bytes),  a  mes-
       sage  retention  period  of 3 days (3 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60
       seconds), a receive message wait time of 20 seconds, and a default vis-
       ibility  timeout of 60 seconds. This example also associates the speci-
       fied dead letter queue with a maximum receive count of 1,000  messages.

       Command:

          aws sqs set-queue-attributes --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyNewQueue --attributes file://set-queue-attributes.json

       Input file (set-queue-attributes.json):

          {
            "DelaySeconds": "10",
            "MaximumMessageSize": "131072",
            "MessageRetentionPeriod": "259200",
            "ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds": "20",
            "RedrivePolicy": "{\"deadLetterTargetArn\":\"arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MyDeadLetterQueue\",\"maxReceiveCount\":\"1000\"}",
            "VisibilityTimeout": "60"
          }

       Output:

          None.

OUTPUT
