CHANGE-MESSAGE-VISIBILITY-BATCH()            CHANGE-MESSAGE-VISIBILITY-BATCH()



NAME
       change-message-visibility-batch -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  visibility  timeout of multiple messages. This is a batch
       version of ``  ChangeMessageVisibility .`` The result of the action  on
       each  message is reported individually in the response. You can send up
       to 10 ``  ChangeMessageVisibility  ``  requests  with  each  ChangeMes-
       sageVisibilityBatch action.

       WARNING:
          Because  the batch request can result in a combination of successful
          and unsuccessful actions, you should check  for  batch  errors  even
          when the call returns an HTTP status code of 200 .

       Some  actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using
       the param.n notation. Values of n are integers  starting  from  1.  For
       example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:
          &AttributeName.1=first

          &AttributeName.2=second

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            change-message-visibility-batch
          --queue-url <value>
          --entries <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The  URL  of  the  Amazon  SQS  queue  whose messages' visibility is
          changed.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --entries (list)
          A list of receipt handles of the messages for which  the  visibility
          timeout must be changed.

          (structure)
              Encloses a receipt handle and an entry id for each message in ``
              ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch .``

              WARNING:
                     All of the following list  parameters  must  be  prefixed
                     with ChangeMessageVisibilityBatchRequestEntry.n , where n
                     is an integer value starting with  1  .  For  example,  a
                     parameter list for this action might look like this:

                 &ChangeMessageVisibilityBatchRequestEntry.1.Id=change_visi-
                 bility_msg_2

                 &ChangeMessageVisibilityBatchRequestEn-
                 try.1.ReceiptHandle=your_receipt_handle

                 &ChangeMessageVisibilityBatchRequestEntry.1.VisibilityTime-
                 out=45

              Id -> (string)
                 An identifier for this particular receipt handle used to com-
                 municate the result.

                 NOTE:
                     The  Id  s  of a batch request need to be unique within a
                     request.

                     This identifier can have up to 80 characters. The follow-
                     ing  characters  are  accepted:  alphanumeric characters,
                     hyphens(-), and underscores (_).

              ReceiptHandle -> (string)
                 A receipt handle.

              VisibilityTimeout -> (integer)
                 The new value (in seconds) for the message's visibility time-
                 out.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,ReceiptHandle=string,VisibilityTimeout=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "ReceiptHandle": "string",
              "VisibilityTimeout": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change multiple messages' timeout visibilities as a batch

       This  example changes the 2 specified messages' timeout visibilities to
       10 hours (10 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds).

       Command:

          aws sqs change-message-visibility-batch --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue --entries file://change-message-visibility-batch.json

       Input file (change-message-visibility-batch.json):

          [
            {
              "Id": "FirstMessage",
                  "ReceiptHandle": "AQEBhz2q...Jf3kaw==",
                  "VisibilityTimeout": 36000
            },
            {
              "Id": "SecondMessage",
                  "ReceiptHandle": "AQEBkTUH...HifSnw==",
                  "VisibilityTimeout": 36000
            }
          ]

       Output:

          {
            "Successful": [
              {
                "Id": "SecondMessage"
              },
              {
                "Id": "FirstMessage"
              }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Successful -> (list)
          A list of ``  ChangeMessageVisibilityBatchResultEntry `` items.

          (structure)
              Encloses the Id of an entry in ``   ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch
              .``

              Id -> (string)
                 Represents  a  message  whose  visibility  timeout  has  been
                 changed successfully.

       Failed -> (list)
          A list of ``  BatchResultErrorEntry `` items.

          (structure)
              Gives a detailed description of the result of an action on  each
              entry in the request.

              Id -> (string)
                 The Id of an entry in a batch request.

              SenderFault -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the error happened due to the caller of the
                 batch API action.

              Code -> (string)
                 An error code representing why  the  action  failed  on  this
                 entry.

              Message -> (string)
                 A message explaining why the action failed on this entry.
