LIST-QUEUES()                                                    LIST-QUEUES()



NAME
       list-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  your  queues  in the current region. The response
       includes a maximum of 1,000 results. If you specify  a  value  for  the
       optional QueueNamePrefix parameter, only queues with a name that begins
       with the specified value are returned.

       The listQueues methods supports pagination. Set parameter MaxResults in
       the  request to specify the maximum number of results to be returned in
       the response. If you do not set MaxResults , the  response  includes  a
       maximum  of  1,000  results.  If you set MaxResults and there are addi-
       tional results to display, the response includes a value for  NextToken
       .  Use  NextToken  as a parameter in your next request to listQueues to
       receive the next page of results.

       list-queues is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: QueueUrls

SYNOPSIS
            list-queues
          [--queue-name-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-name-prefix (string)
          A  string  to  use for filtering the list results. Only those queues
          whose name begins with the specified string are returned.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list queues

       This example lists all queues.

       Command:

          aws sqs list-queues

       Output:

          {
            "QueueUrls": [
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyDeadLetterQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyOtherQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/TestQueue1",
                  "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/TestQueue2"
            ]
          }

       This example lists only queues that start with "My".

       Command:

          aws sqs list-queues --queue-name-prefix My

       Output:

          {
            "QueueUrls": [
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyDeadLetterQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyOtherQueue"
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       QueueUrls -> (list)
          A  list  of  queue URLs, up to 1,000 entries, or the value of MaxRe-
          sults that you sent in the request.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token to include in the next request. Token value is null
          if there are no additional results to request, or if you did not set
          MaxResults in the request.
