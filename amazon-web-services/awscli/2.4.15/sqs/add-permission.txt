ADD-PERMISSION()                                              ADD-PERMISSION()



NAME
       add-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a  permission  to  a queue for a specific principal . This allows
       sharing access to the queue.

       When you create a queue, you have full control access  rights  for  the
       queue.  Only you, the owner of the queue, can grant or deny permissions
       to the queue. For more information about these permissions,  see  Allow
       Developers to Write Messages to a Shared Queue in the Amazon SQS Devel-
       oper Guide .

       NOTE:

          o AddPermission  generates  a  policy  for  you.  You  can  use   ``
            SetQueueAttributes `` to upload your policy. For more information,
            see Using Custom Policies with the Amazon SQS Access  Policy  Lan-
            guage in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          o An Amazon SQS policy can have a maximum of 7 actions.

          o To  remove  the ability to change queue permissions, you must deny
            permission  to  the  AddPermission  ,   RemovePermission   ,   and
            SetQueueAttributes actions in your IAM policy.

       Some  actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using
       the param.n notation. Values of n are integers  starting  from  1.  For
       example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:
          &AttributeName.1=first

          &AttributeName.2=second

       NOTE:
          Cross-account  permissions  don't  apply  to  this  action. For more
          information, see Grant cross-account permissions to  a  role  and  a
          user name in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            add-permission
          --queue-url <value>
          --label <value>
          --aws-account-ids <value>
          --actions <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue to which permissions are added.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --label (string)
          The  unique  identification  of  the  permission you're setting (for
          example, AliceSendMessage ). Maximum 80 characters. Allowed  charac-
          ters  include alphanumeric characters, hyphens (- ), and underscores
          (_ ).

       --aws-account-ids (list)
          The Amazon Web Services account numbers of the principals who are to
          receive  permission.  For  information about locating the Amazon Web
          Services account identification, see Your Amazon Web Services  Iden-
          tifiers in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --actions (list)
          The  action  the  client wants to allow for the specified principal.
          Valid values: the name of any action or * .

          For more information about these actions, see Overview  of  Managing
          Access  Permissions  to Your Amazon Simple Queue Service Resource in
          the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          Specifying SendMessage , DeleteMessage , or  ChangeMessageVisibility
          for ActionName.n also grants permissions for the corresponding batch
          versions of those actions: SendMessageBatch ,  DeleteMessageBatch  ,
          and ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
