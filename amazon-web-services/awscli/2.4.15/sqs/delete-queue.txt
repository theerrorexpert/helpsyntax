DELETE-QUEUE()                                                  DELETE-QUEUE()



NAME
       delete-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the queue specified by the QueueUrl , regardless of the queue's
       contents.

       WARNING:
          Be careful with the DeleteQueue action: When you delete a queue, any
          messages in the queue are no longer available.

       When  you  delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds.
       Requests you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might suc-
       ceed.  For  example,  a  ``   SendMessage `` request might succeed, but
       after 60 seconds the queue and the message you sent no longer exist.

       When you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before  cre-
       ating a queue with the same name.

       NOTE:
          Cross-account  permissions  don't  apply  to  this  action. For more
          information, see Grant cross-account permissions to  a  role  and  a
          user name in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-queue
          --queue-url <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue to delete.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
