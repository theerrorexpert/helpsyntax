DELETE-MESSAGE()                                              DELETE-MESSAGE()



NAME
       delete-message -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified message from the specified queue. To select the
       message to delete, use the ReceiptHandle of the message (not  the  Mes-
       sageId  which  you  receive  when you send the message). Amazon SQS can
       delete a message from a queue even  if  a  visibility  timeout  setting
       causes  the  message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS auto-
       matically deletes messages left in a queue longer  than  the  retention
       period configured for the queue.

       NOTE:
          The  ReceiptHandle is associated with a specific instance of receiv-
          ing a message.  If  you  receive  a  message  more  than  once,  the
          ReceiptHandle is different each time you receive a message. When you
          use the DeleteMessage action, you must  provide  the  most  recently
          received  ReceiptHandle for the message (otherwise, the request suc-
          ceeds, but the message might not be deleted).

          For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even  after
          you  delete  it.  This  might happen on rare occasions if one of the
          servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable  when  you
          send  the  request  to  delete  the message. The copy remains on the
          server and might be returned to  you  during  a  subsequent  receive
          request.  You  should ensure that your application is idempotent, so
          that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-message
          --queue-url <value>
          --receipt-handle <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue from which messages are deleted.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --receipt-handle (string)
          The receipt handle associated with the message to delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
