LIST-DEAD-LETTER-SOURCE-QUEUES()              LIST-DEAD-LETTER-SOURCE-QUEUES()



NAME
       list-dead-letter-source-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  your  queues  that  have  the RedrivePolicy queue
       attribute configured with a dead-letter queue.

       The ListDeadLetterSourceQueues methods supports pagination. Set parame-
       ter  MaxResults in the request to specify the maximum number of results
       to be returned in the response. If you do  not  set  MaxResults  ,  the
       response includes a maximum of 1,000 results. If you set MaxResults and
       there are additional results to display, the response includes a  value
       for  NextToken  .  Use NextToken as a parameter in your next request to
       ListDeadLetterSourceQueues to receive the next page of results.

       For more information about using dead-letter queues, see  Using  Amazon
       SQS Dead-Letter Queues in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       list-dead-letter-source-queues  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: queueUrls

SYNOPSIS
            list-dead-letter-source-queues
          --queue-url <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of a dead-letter queue.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list dead letter source queues

       This  example  lists  the queues that are associated with the specified
       dead letter source queue.

       Command:

          aws sqs list-dead-letter-source-queues --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyDeadLetterQueue

       Output:

          {
            "queueUrls": [
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyOtherQueue"
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       queueUrls -> (list)
          A list of source  queue  URLs  that  have  the  RedrivePolicy  queue
          attribute configured with a dead-letter queue.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token to include in the next request. Token value is null
          if there are no additional results to request, or if you did not set
          MaxResults in the request.
