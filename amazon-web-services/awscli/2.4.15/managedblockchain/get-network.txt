GET-NETWORK()                                                    GET-NETWORK()



NAME
       get-network -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed information about a network.

       Applies to Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-network
          --network-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network to get information about.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 Edition -> (string)
                     The edition of Amazon Managed Blockchain that Hyperledger
                     Fabric  uses.  For  more  information, see Amazon Managed
                     Blockchain Pricing .

              Ethereum -> (structure)
                 Attributes of an  Ethereum  network  for  Managed  Blockchain
                 resources participating in an Ethereum network.

                 ChainId -> (string)
                     The  Ethereum  CHAIN_ID associated with the Ethereum net-
                     work. Chain IDs are as follows:

                     o mainnet = 1

                     o rinkeby = 4

                     o ropsten = 3

          VpcEndpointServiceName -> (string)
              The VPC endpoint service name of the VPC endpoint service of the
              network.  Members  use the VPC endpoint service name to create a
              VPC endpoint to access network resources.

          VotingPolicy -> (structure)
              The voting rules for the network to  decide  if  a  proposal  is
              accepted.

              ApprovalThresholdPolicy -> (structure)
                 Defines  the  rules  for the network for voting on proposals,
                 such as the percentage of YES votes required for the proposal
                 to  be  approved and the duration of the proposal. The policy
                 applies to all proposals and is specified when the network is
                 created.

                 ThresholdPercentage -> (integer)
                     The  percentage  of  votes among all members that must be
                     YES for a proposal to be approved. For example, a Thresh-
                     oldPercentage  value  of 50 indicates 50%. The Threshold-
                     Comparator  determines  the  precise  comparison.  If   a
                     ThresholdPercentage value of 50 is specified on a network
                     with 10 members, along with a  ThresholdComparator  value
                     of  GREATER_THAN  ,  this  indicates that 6 YES votes are
                     required for the proposal to be approved.

                 ProposalDurationInHours -> (integer)
                     The duration from the time that  a  proposal  is  created
                     until  it  expires.  If members cast neither the required
                     number of YES votes to approve the proposal nor the  num-
                     ber of NO votes required to reject it before the duration
                     expires, the proposal is EXPIRED and ProposalActions  are
                     not carried out.

                 ThresholdComparator -> (string)
                     Determines  whether  the  vote percentage must be greater
                     than the ThresholdPercentage or must be greater  than  or
                     equal to the ThreholdPercentage to be approved.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the network.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the network was created.

          Tags -> (map)
              Tags  assigned  to  the  network. Each tag consists of a key and
              optional value.

              For more information about tags, see Tagging  Resources  in  the
              Amazon  Managed Blockchain Ethereum Developer Guide , or Tagging
              Resources in the Amazon Managed  Blockchain  Hyperledger  Fabric
              Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the network. For more informa-
              tion about ARNs and their  format,  see  Amazon  Resource  Names
              (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .
