NAME
       update-member -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a member configuration with new parameters.

       Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-member
          --network-id <value>
          --member-id <value>
          [--log-publishing-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the Managed Blockchain network to which the
          member belongs.

       --member-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the member.

       --log-publishing-configuration (structure)
          Configuration properties for publishing to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

          Fabric -> (structure)
              Configuration properties for logging events  associated  with  a
              member  of  a  Managed  Blockchain network using the Hyperledger
              Fabric framework.

              CaLogs -> (structure)
                 Configuration properties for logging events associated with a
                 member's  Certificate Authority (CA). CA logs help you deter-
                 mine when a member in your account joins the network, or when
                 new peers register with a member CA.

                 Cloudwatch -> (structure)
                     Parameters for publishing logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether logging is enabled.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Fabric": {
              "CaLogs": {
                "Cloudwatch": {
                  "Enabled": true|false
                }
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
