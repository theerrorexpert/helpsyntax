LIST-PROPOSALS()                                              LIST-PROPOSALS()



NAME
       list-proposals -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of proposals for the network.

       Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-proposals
          --network-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of proposals to return.

       --next-token (string)
          The  pagination  token  that  indicates  the  next set of results to
          retrieve.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Proposals -> (list)
          The summary of each proposal made on the network.

          (structure)
              Properties of a proposal.

              Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

              ProposalId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the proposal.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the proposal.

              ProposedByMemberId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the member  that  created  the  pro-
                 posal.

              ProposedByMemberName -> (string)
                 The name of the member that created the proposal.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the proposal. Values are as follows:

                 o IN_PROGRESS  -  The  proposal is active and open for member
                   voting.

                 o APPROVED - The proposal was approved  with  sufficient  YES
                   votes among members according to the VotingPolicy specified
                   for the Network . The specified proposal actions  are  car-
                   ried out.

                 o REJECTED  - The proposal was rejected with insufficient YES
                   votes among members according to the VotingPolicy specified
                   for  the  Network  .  The specified ProposalActions are not
                   carried out.

                 o EXPIRED - Members did not cast the number of votes required
                   to  determine  the  proposal  outcome  before  the proposal
                   expired. The specified ProposalActions are not carried out.

                 o ACTION_FAILED  -  One  or more of the specified ProposalAc-
                   tions in a proposal that was approved  could  not  be  com-
                   pleted because of an error.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the proposal was created.

              ExpirationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the proposal expires. This is the Cre-
                 ationDate plus the ProposalDurationInHours that is  specified
                 in the ProposalThresholdPolicy . After this date and time, if
                 members have not cast enough votes to determine  the  outcome
                 according  to  the voting policy, the proposal is EXPIRED and
                 Actions are not carried out.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  proposal.  For  more
                 information  about ARNs and their format, see Amazon Resource
                 Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that indicates  the  next  set  of  results  to
          retrieve.
