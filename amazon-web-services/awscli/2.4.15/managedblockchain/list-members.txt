SYNOPSIS
            list-members
          --network-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--is-owned | --no-is-owned]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network for which to list members.

       --name (string)
          The optional name of the member to list.

       --status (string)
          An optional status specifier. If provided, only members currently in
          this status are listed.

          Possible values:

          o CREATING

          o AVAILABLE

          o CREATE_FAILED

          o UPDATING

          o DELETING

          o DELETED

          o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY

       --is-owned | --no-is-owned (boolean)
          An  optional  Boolean  value.  If  provided,  the request is limited
          either to members that the current AWS account owns (true ) or  that
          other AWS accounts own (false ). If omitted, all members are listed.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of members to return in the request.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token that indicates  the  next  set  of  results  to
          retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Members -> (list)
          An  array  of  MemberSummary  objects.  Each object contains details
          about a network member.

          (structure)
              A summary of configuration properties for a member.

              Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the member.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the member.

              Description -> (string)
                 An optional description of the member.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the member.

                 o CREATING - The AWS account is in the process of creating  a
                   member.

                 o AVAILABLE - The member has been created and can participate
                   in the network.

                 o CREATE_FAILED - The AWS account attempted to create a  mem-
                   ber and creation failed.

                 o UPDATING - The member is in the process of being updated.

                 o DELETING  -  The member and all associated resources are in
                   the process of being deleted. Either the AWS  account  that
                   owns  the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted
                   as the result of an APPROVED  PROPOSAL to remove  the  mem-
                   ber.

                 o DELETED  - The member can no longer participate on the net-
                   work and all associated resources are deleted.  Either  the
                   AWS  account that owns the member deleted it, or the member
                   is being deleted as the result of an APPROVED  PROPOSAL  to
                   remove the member.

                 o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY  -  The  member is impaired and
                   might not function as expected because it cannot access the
                   specified  customer  managed key in AWS Key Management Ser-
                   vice (AWS KMS) for encryption at rest. Either the  KMS  key
                   was  disabled  or  deleted,  or  the grants on the key were
                   revoked. The effect of disabling  or  deleting  a  key,  or
                   revoking  a  grant  is  not  immediate. The member resource
                   might take some time to find that the key is  inaccessible.
                   When a resource is in this state, we recommend deleting and
                   recreating the resource.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the member was created.

              IsOwned -> (boolean)
                 An indicator of whether the  member  is  owned  by  your  AWS
                 account or a different AWS account.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the member. For more infor-
                 mation about ARNs and their format, see Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token  that  indicates  the  next set of results to
          retrieve.
