SYNOPSIS
            create-member
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          --invitation-id <value>
          --network-id <value>
          --member-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the operation. An idempotent operation  completes  no
          more  than  one time. This identifier is required only if you make a
          service request directly using an HTTP client. It is generated auto-
          matically if you use an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.

       --invitation-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the invitation that is sent to the member
          to join the network.

       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network in which the member is created.

       --member-configuration (structure)
          Member configuration parameters.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the member.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description of the member.

          FrameworkConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration properties of the blockchain framework relevant to
              the member.

              Fabric -> (structure)
                 Attributes of Hyperledger Fabric for a member  on  a  Managed
                 Blockchain network that uses Hyperledger Fabric.

                 AdminUsername -> (string)
                     The  user  name  for  the member's initial administrative
                     user.

                 AdminPassword -> (string)
                     The password  for  the  member's  initial  administrative
                     user. The AdminPassword must be at least eight characters
                     long and no more than 32 characters. It must  contain  at
                     least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one
                     digit. It cannot have a single quotation mark (), a  dou-
                     ble  quotation  marks  (), a forward slash(/), a backward
                     slash(), @, or a space.

          LogPublishingConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration properties for logging events  associated  with  a
              member of a Managed Blockchain network.

              Fabric -> (structure)
                 Configuration properties for logging events associated with a
                 member of a Managed Blockchain network using the  Hyperledger
                 Fabric framework.

                 CaLogs -> (structure)
                     Configuration  properties  for  logging events associated
                     with a member's Certificate Authority (CA). CA logs  help
                     you  determine  when  a  member in your account joins the
                     network, or when new peers register with a member CA.

                     Cloudwatch -> (structure)
                        Parameters for publishing logs  to  Amazon  CloudWatch

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether logging is enabled.

          Tags -> (map)
              Tags  assigned to the member. Tags consist of a key and optional
              value. For more information about tags, see Tagging Resources in
              the Amazon Managed Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric Developer Guide
              .

              When specifying tags during creation, you can  specify  multiple
              key-value  pairs in a single request, with an overall maximum of
              50 tags added to each resource.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer  managed  key  in
              AWS  Key  Management  Service (AWS KMS) to use for encryption at
              rest in the member. This parameter is  inherited  by  any  nodes
              that this member creates.

              Use one of the following options to specify this parameter:

              o Undefined  or  empty string - The member uses an AWS owned KMS
                key for encryption by default.

              o A valid symmetric customer managed KMS key - The  member  uses
                the  specified  key  for encryption. Amazon Managed Blockchain
                doesn't support asymmetric keys.  For  more  information,  see
                Using  symmetric and asymmetric keys in the AWS Key Management
                Service Developer Guide . The following is an example of a KMS
                key                                                       ARN:
                arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       JSON Syntax:

            "Name": "string",
            "Description": "string",
            "FrameworkConfiguration": {

                "AdminPassword": "string"

                "CaLogs": {
                  "Cloudwatch": {
                    "Enabled": true|false
                  }

              ...},
            "KmsKeyArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MemberId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the member.
