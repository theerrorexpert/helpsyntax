NAME
       get-proposal -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed information about a proposal.

       Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-proposal
          --network-id <value>
          --proposal-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network for which the proposal is made.

       --proposal-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the proposal.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     An  action  to  remove a member from a Managed Blockchain
                     network as the result  of  a  removal  proposal  that  is
                     APPROVED  .  The  member and all associated resources are
                     deleted from the network.

                     Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

                     MemberId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier of the member to remove.

          ProposedByMemberId -> (string)

          ProposedByMemberName -> (string)
              The name of the member that created the proposal.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the proposal. Values are as follows:

              o IN_PROGRESS - The proposal is active and open for member  vot-
                ing.

              o APPROVED - The proposal was approved with sufficient YES votes
                among members according to the VotingPolicy specified for  the
                Network . The specified proposal actions are carried out.

              o REJECTED  -  The  proposal  was rejected with insufficient YES
                votes among members according to  the  VotingPolicy  specified
                for  the  Network . The specified ProposalActions are not car-
                ried out.

              o EXPIRED - Members did not cast the number of votes required to
                determine  the  proposal  outcome before the proposal expired.
                The specified ProposalActions are not carried out.

              o ACTION_FAILED - One or more of the  specified  ProposalActions
                in a proposal that was approved could not be completed because
                of an error. The ACTION_FAILED status occurs even if only  one
                ProposalAction fails and other actions are successful.

          ExpirationDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time that the proposal expires. This is the Cre-
              ationDate plus the ProposalDurationInHours that is specified  in
              the  ProposalThresholdPolicy . After this date and time, if mem-
              bers have not cast enough votes to determine the outcome accord-
              ing  to  the  voting policy, the proposal is EXPIRED and Actions
              are not carried out.

          OutstandingVoteCount -> (integer)
              The number of votes remaining to be cast on the proposal by mem-
              bers. In other words, the number of members minus the sum of YES
              votes and NO votes.

          Tags -> (map)
