DESCRIPTION
       Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps identify potential
       resource-access risks by enabling you to  identify  any  policies  that
       grant   access  to  an  external  principal.  It  does  this  by  using
       logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon
       Web  Services  environment. An external principal can be another Amazon
       Web Services account, a root user, an IAM user  or  role,  a  federated
       user,  an  Amazon  Web  Services service, or an anonymous user. You can
       also use IAM  Access  Analyzer  to  preview  and  validate  public  and
       cross-account  access  to  your  resources before deploying permissions
       changes. This guide describes the Identity and Access Management Access
       Analyzer  operations  that  you  can call programmatically. For general
       information about IAM Access Analyzer, see Identity and Access  Manage-
       ment Access Analyzer in the IAM User Guide .

       To  start  using  IAM Access Analyzer, you first need to create an ana-
       lyzer.
