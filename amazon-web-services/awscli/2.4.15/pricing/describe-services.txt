DESCRIBE-SERVICES()                                        DESCRIBE-SERVICES()



NAME
       describe-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the metadata for one service or a list of the metadata for all
       services. Use this without a service code to get the service codes  for
       all  services.  Use  it with a service code, such as AmazonEC2 , to get
       information specific to that  service,  such  as  the  attribute  names
       available  for  that  service. For example, some of the attribute names
       available for EC2 are volumeType , maxIopsVolume ,  operation  ,  loca-
       tionType , and instanceCapacity10xlarge .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-services  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Services

SYNOPSIS
            describe-services
          [--service-code <value>]
          [--format-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-code (string)
          The code for the service whose information  you  want  to  retrieve,
          such  as  AmazonEC2  .  You  can  use  the ServiceCode to filter the
          results in a GetProducts call. To retrieve a list of  all  services,
          leave this blank.

       --format-version (string)
          The format version that you want the response to be in.

          Valid values are: aws_v1

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve service metadata

       This example retrieves the metadata for the Amazon EC2 service code.

       Command:

          aws pricing describe-services --service-code AmazonEC2 --format-version aws_v1 --max-items 1

       Output:
