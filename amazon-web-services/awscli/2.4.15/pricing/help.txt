DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web  Services Price List Service API (Amazon Web Services Price
       List Service) is a centralized and convenient way  to  programmatically
       query  Amazon Web Services for services, products, and pricing informa-
       tion. The Amazon Web Services  Price  List  Service  uses  standardized
       product  attributes  such  as  Location , Storage Class , and Operating
       System , and provides prices at the SKU level. You can use  the  Amazon
       Web  Services  Price  List  Service  to build cost control and scenario
       planning tools, reconcile billing data, forecast future spend for  bud-
       geting  purposes,  and  provide cost benefit analysis that compare your
       internal workloads with Amazon Web Services.

       Use GetServices without a service code to retrieve  the  service  codes
       for  all AWS services, then GetServices with a service code to retreive
       the attribute names for that service. After you have the  service  code
       and  attribute names, you can use GetAttributeValues to see what values
       are available for an attribute. With the service code and an  attribute
       name  and value, you can use GetProducts to find specific products that
       you're interested in, such as an AmazonEC2 instance, with a Provisioned
       IOPS  volumeType .
