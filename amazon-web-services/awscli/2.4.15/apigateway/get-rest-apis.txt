GET-REST-APIS()                                                GET-REST-APIS()



NAME
       get-rest-apis -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the  RestApis resources for your collection.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-rest-apis  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-rest-apis
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of REST APIs

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-rest-apis

       Output:

          {
              "items": [
                  {
                      "createdDate": 1438884790,
                      "id": "12s44z21rb",
                      "name": "My First API"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents a REST API.
                 Create an API

              id -> (string)
                 The API's identifier. This identifier is unique across all of
                 your APIs in API Gateway.

              name -> (string)
                 The API's name.

              description -> (string)
                 The API's description.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the API was created.

              version -> (string)
                 A version identifier for the API.

              warnings -> (list)
                 The warning messages reported when failonwarnings  is  turned
                 on during API import.

                 (string)

              binaryMediaTypes -> (list)
                 The list of binary media types supported by the  RestApi . By
                 default, the  RestApi supports only UTF-8-encoded  text  pay-
                 loads.

                 (string)

              minimumCompressionSize -> (integer)
                 A  nullable  integer that is used to enable compression (with
                 non-negative between 0 and 10485760 (10M)  bytes,  inclusive)
                 or  disable  compression  (with a null value) on an API. When
                 compression is enabled, compression or decompression  is  not
                 applied  on  the  payload if the payload size is smaller than
                 this value. Setting it to zero  allows  compression  for  any
                 payload size.

              apiKeySource -> (string)
                 The  source of the API key for metering requests according to
                 a usage plan. Valid values are:

                 o HEADER to read the API key from the X-API-Key header  of  a
                   request.

                 o AUTHORIZER  to read the API key from the UsageIdentifierKey
                   from a custom authorizer.

              endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The endpoint configuration of this  RestApi showing the  end-
                 point types of the API.

                 types -> (list)
                     A  list  of  endpoint  types of an API ( RestApi ) or its
                     custom domain name ( DomainName ). For an  edge-optimized
                     API  and  its  custom  domain  name, the endpoint type is
                     "EDGE" . For a regional API and its custom  domain  name,
                     the  endpoint  type  is REGIONAL . For a private API, the
                     endpoint type is PRIVATE .

                     (string)
                        The endpoint type.  The  valid  values  are  EDGE  for
                        edge-optimized  API  setup,  most  suitable for mobile
                        applications; REGIONAL for regional API endpoint  set-
                        up,  most  suitable  for  calling from AWS Region; and
                        PRIVATE for private APIs.

                 vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
                     A list of VpcEndpointIds of an API (  RestApi  )  against
                     which to create Route53 ALIASes. It is only supported for
                     PRIVATE endpoint type.

                     (string)

              policy -> (string)
                 A stringified JSON  policy  document  that  applies  to  this
                 RestApi regardless of the caller and  Method configuration.

              tags -> (map)
                 The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a
                 given resource.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              disableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether clients can invoke your API  by  using  the
                 default  execute-api endpoint. By default, clients can invoke
                 your          API          with          the          default
                 https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com endpoint.
                 To require that clients use a custom domain  name  to  invoke
                 your API, disable the default endpoint.
