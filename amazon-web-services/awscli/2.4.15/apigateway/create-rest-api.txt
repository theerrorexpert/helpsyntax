OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          [Required] The name of the  RestApi .

       --description (string)
          The description of the  RestApi .

       --clone-from (string)
          The ID of the  RestApi that you want to clone from.

       --binary-media-types (list)
          The  list  of  binary  media  types  supported  by the  RestApi . By
          default, the  RestApi supports only UTF-8-encoded text payloads.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --minimum-compression-size (integer)
          A nullable integer that is used to enable compression (with non-neg-
          ative between 0 and 10485760 (10M) bytes, inclusive) or disable com-
          pression (with a null value) on an API. When compression is enabled,
          compression  or  decompression  is not applied on the payload if the
          payload size is smaller than this value. Setting it to  zero  allows
          compression for any payload size.

       --api-key-source (string)
          The source of the API key for metering requests according to a usage
          plan. Valid values are:

          o HEADER to read the API key from the X-API-Key header of a request.

          o AUTHORIZER  to read the API key from the UsageIdentifierKey from a
            custom authorizer.

          Possible values:

          o HEADER

          o AUTHORIZER

       --endpoint-configuration (structure)
          The endpoint configuration of this   RestApi  showing  the  endpoint
          types of the API.

          types -> (list)
              A  list  of  endpoint  types of an API ( RestApi ) or its custom
              domain name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized  API  and  its
              custom domain name, the endpoint type is "EDGE" . For a regional
              API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL  .
              For a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The  endpoint  type. The valid values are EDGE for edge-opti-
                 mized API  setup,  most  suitable  for  mobile  applications;
                 REGIONAL  for  regional API endpoint setup, most suitable for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A list of VpcEndpointIds of an API ( RestApi ) against which  to
              create  Route53  ALIASes.  It is only supported for PRIVATE end-
              point type.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          types=string,string,vpcEndpointIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "types": ["REGIONAL"|"EDGE"|"PRIVATE", ...],
            "vpcEndpointIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --policy (string) A stringified JSON policy document  that  applies  to
       this RestApi regardless of the caller and  Method configuration.

       --tags (map)
          The   key-value   map   of  strings.  The  valid  character  set  is
          [a-zA-Z+-=._:/]. The tag key can be up to 128  characters  and  must
          not start with aws: . The tag value can be up to 256 characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --disable-execute-api-endpoint    |   --no-disable-execute-api-endpoint
       (boolean)
          Specifies whether clients can invoke your API by using  the  default
          execute-api  endpoint.  By default, clients can invoke your API with
          the default https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com end-
          point.  To  require  that clients use a custom domain name to invoke
          your API, disable the default endpoint.

       --api-version (string)
          A version identifier for the API.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
