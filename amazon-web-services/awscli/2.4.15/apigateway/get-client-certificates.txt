GET-CLIENT-CERTIFICATES()                            GET-CLIENT-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       get-client-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a collection of  ClientCertificate resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-client-certificates  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-client-certificates
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of client certificates

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-client-certificates

       Output:

          {
              "items": [
                  {
                      "pemEncodedCertificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- <certificate content> -----END CERTIFICATE-----",
                      "clientCertificateId": "a1b2c3",
                      "expirationDate": 1483556561,
                      "description": "My Client Certificate",
                      "createdDate": 1452020561
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  client  certificate used to configure client-side
              SSL authentication while sending  requests  to  the  integration
              endpoint.
                 Client  certificates  are  used to authenticate an API by the
                 backend server. To authenticate an API client (or user),  use
                 IAM  roles  and  policies,  a custom  Authorizer or an Amazon
                 Cognito user pool.  Use Client-Side Certificate

              clientCertificateId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the client certificate.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the client certificate.

              pemEncodedCertificate -> (string)
                 The PEM-encoded public key of the client  certificate,  which
                 can  be  used  to configure certificate authentication in the
                 integration endpoint .

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the client certificate was created.

              expirationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the client certificate will expire.

              tags -> (map)
                 The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a
                 given resource.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
