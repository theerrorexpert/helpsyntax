NAME
       get-integration-response -

DESCRIPTION
       Represents a get integration response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-integration-response
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          --http-method <value>
          --status-code <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --resource-id (string)
          [Required]  Specifies  a get integration response request's resource
          identifier.

       --http-method (string)
          [Required] Specifies  a  get  integration  response  request's  HTTP
          method.

       --status-code (string)
          [Required]  Specifies  a  get  integration response request's status
          code.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the integration response configuration for a HTTP method defined
       under a REST API's resource

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-integration-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id y9h6rt --http-method GET --status-code 200

       Output:

          {
              "statusCode": "200",
              "responseTemplates": {
                  "application/json": null
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       statusCode -> (string)
          Specifies  the  status  code  that  is  used  to map the integration
          response to an existing  MethodResponse .

       selectionPattern -> (string)
          Specifies the regular expression (regex) pattern used to  choose  an
          integration  response  based  on the response from the back end. For
          example, if the success  response  returns  nothing  and  the  error
          response  returns  some  string, you could use the .+ regex to match
          error response. However, make sure that the error response does  not
          contain  any  newline (\n ) character in such cases. If the back end
          is an AWS Lambda function, the AWS Lambda function error  header  is
          matched.  For all other HTTP and AWS back ends, the HTTP status code
          is matched.

       responseParameters -> (map)
          A key-value map specifying response parameters that  are  passed  to
          the  method response from the back end. The key is a method response
          header parameter  name  and  the  mapped  value  is  an  integration
          response header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of sin-
          gle quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body.
          The     mapping     key     must     match     the     pattern    of
          method.response.header.{name} , where name is  a  valid  and  unique
          header  name.  The mapped non-static value must match the pattern of
          integration.response.header.{name}            or            integra-
          tion.response.body.{JSON-expression}  ,  where  name  is a valid and
          unique response header name and  JSON-expression  is  a  valid  JSON
          expression without the $ prefix.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       responseTemplates -> (map)
          Specifies  the  templates used to transform the integration response
          body. Response templates are represented as a key/value map, with  a
          content-type as the key and a template as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       contentHandling -> (string)
          Specifies  how  to handle response payload content type conversions.
          Supported values are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and  CONVERT_TO_TEXT  ,  with
          the following behaviors:

          o CONVERT_TO_BINARY   :   Converts   a   response   payload  from  a
            Base64-encoded string to the corresponding binary blob.

          o CONVERT_TO_TEXT : Converts a response payload from a  binary  blob
            to a Base64-encoded string.

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through from the integration response to the method response without
          modification.
