NAME
       get-vpc-links -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  VpcLinks collection under the caller's account in a selected
       region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-vpc-links is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-vpc-links
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              An API Gateway VPC link for a  RestApi to access resources in an
              Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

              To  enable  access  to  a  resource in an Amazon Virtual Private
              Cloud through Amazon API Gateway, you, as an API developer, cre-
              ate  a   VpcLink  resource targeted for one or more network load
              balancers of the VPC and then integrate an  API  method  with  a
              private  integration  that uses the  VpcLink . The private inte-
              gration has an integration type of HTTP or HTTP_PROXY and has  a
              connection  type  of VPC_LINK . The integration uses the connec-
              tionId property to identify the  VpcLink used.

              id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the  VpcLink . It is used in  an   Integra-
                 tion to reference this  VpcLink .

              name -> (string)
                 The name used to label and identify the VPC link.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the VPC link.

              targetArns -> (list)
                 The  ARN  of the network load balancer of the VPC targeted by
                 the VPC link. The network load balancer must be owned by  the
                 same AWS account of the API owner.

                 (string)

              status -> (string)
                 The  status of the VPC link. The valid values are AVAILABLE ,
                 PENDING , DELETING , or FAILED . Deploying an API  will  wait
                 if  the  status  is  PENDING  and  will fail if the status is
                 DELETING .

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A description about the VPC link status.

              tags -> (map)
                 The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a
                 given resource.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)



                                                               GET-VPC-LINKS()
