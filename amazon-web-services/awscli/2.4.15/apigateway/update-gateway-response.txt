       --patch-operations (list)
          A list of update operations to be applied to the specified  resource
          and in the order specified in this list.

          (structure)
              A  single  patch  operation  to apply to the specified resource.
              Please refer to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4 for
              an explanation of how each operation is used.

              op -> (string)
                 An  update operation to be performed with this PATCH request.
                 The valid value can be add , remove , replace or copy  .  Not
                 all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Sup-
                 port of the operations depends on specific  operational  con-
                 texts.  Attempts  to  apply  an  unsupported  operation  on a
                 resource will return an error message.

              path -> (string)
                 The op operation's target, as identified by  a  JSON  Pointer
                 value   that   references  a  location  within  the  targeted
                 resource. For example, if the target resource has an  update-
                 able  property  of {"name":"value"} , the path for this prop-
                 erty is /name . If the name property value is a  JSON  object
                 (e.g.,  {"name":  {"child/name":  "child-value"}} ), the path
                 for the child/name property will be /name/child~1name  .  Any
                 slash ("/") character appearing in path names must be escaped
                 with "~1", as shown in the example above. Each  op  operation
                 can have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The  new target value of the update operation. It is applica-
                 ble for the add or replace operation. When using AWS  CLI  to
                 update  a  property  of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object
                 with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell,  e.g.,  '{"a":
                 ...}'. In a Windows shell, see Using JSON for Parameters .

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within  the  tar-
                 geted  resource  to copy the value from. For example, to pro-
                 mote a canary deployment, you copy the canary  deployment  ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a  Stage  resource  with  "op":"copy"  ,  "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       responseType -> (string)
          The response type of the associated  GatewayResponse .

       statusCode -> (string)
          The HTTP status code for this  GatewayResponse .

       responseParameters -> (map)
          Response parameters (paths, query strings and headers) of the  Gate-
          wayResponse as a string-to-string map of key-value pairs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       responseTemplates -> (map)
          Response templates of the  GatewayResponse as a string-to-string map
          of key-value pairs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       defaultResponse -> (boolean)
          A  Boolean  flag  to  indicate  whether this  GatewayResponse is the
          default gateway response (true ) or not (false ). A default  gateway
          response  is  one generated by API Gateway without any customization
          by an API developer.
