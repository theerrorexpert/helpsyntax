          edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name.

       --certificate-body (string)
          [Deprecated] The body of the server certificate that will be used by
          edge-optimized  endpoint  for this domain name provided by your cer-

          certificate, one after the other without any blank lines, used by an
          edge-optimized  endpoint  for  this  domain name. If you include the
          root certificate, your certificate chain must start with  intermedi-
          ate certificates and end with the root certificate. Use the interme-
          diate certificates that were provided by your certificate authority.
          Do not include any intermediaries that are not in the chain of trust
          path.

       --certificate-arn (string)
          The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that  will  be  used  by

          regional endpoint for this domain name.

       --regional-certificate-arn (string)
          The  reference  to  an  AWS-managed certificate that will be used by
          regional endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certificate  Manager  is
          the only supported source.

       --endpoint-configuration (structure)
          The  endpoint configuration of this  DomainName showing the endpoint
          types of the domain name.

          types -> (list)
              A list of endpoint types of an API ( RestApi  )  or  its  custom
              domain  name  (  DomainName ). For an edge-optimized API and its
              custom domain name, the endpoint type is "EDGE" . For a regional
              API  and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL .
              For a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The endpoint type. The valid values are EDGE  for  edge-opti-
                 mized  API  setup,  most  suitable  for  mobile applications;
                 REGIONAL for regional API endpoint setup, most  suitable  for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A  list of VpcEndpointIds of an API ( RestApi ) against which to
              create Route53 ALIASes. It is only supported  for  PRIVATE  end-

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          types=string,string,vpcEndpointIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {

          The   key-value   map   of  strings.  The  valid  character  set  is
          [a-zA-Z+-=._:/]. The tag key can be up to 128  characters  and  must
          not start with aws: . The tag value can be up to 256 characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --security-policy (string)
          The  Transport  Layer Security (TLS) version + cipher suite for this
          DomainName . The valid values are TLS_1_0 and TLS_1_2 .

          Possible values:

          o TLS_1_0

          o TLS_1_2

       --mutual-tls-authentication (structure)
          If specified, API Gateway performs  two-way  authentication  between
          the  client  and the server. Clients must present a trusted certifi-
          cate to access your custom domain name.

          truststoreUri -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 resource ARN  that  specifies  the  truststore  for
              mutual        TLS       authentication,       for       example,
              s3://bucket-name/key-name . The truststore can contain  certifi-
              cates  from public or private certificate authorities. To update
              the truststore, upload a new version to S3, and then update your
              custom  domain name to use the new version. To update the trust-
              store, you must have permissions to access the S3 object.

          truststoreVersion -> (string)
              The version of the S3 object that contains your  truststore.  To
              specify  a  version, you must have versioning enabled for the S3
              bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          truststoreUri=string,truststoreVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "truststoreUri": "string",
            "truststoreVersion": "string"
          }

       --ownership-verification-certificate-arn (string)
          The ARN of the public certificate issued by ACM to  validate  owner-
          ship  of  your  custom domain. Only required when configuring mutual
          TLS and using an ACM imported or private CA certificate ARN  as  the
          regionalCertificateArn.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       mutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
          The mutual TLS authentication  configuration  for  a  custom  domain
          name.  If  specified,  API  Gateway  performs two-way authentication

          certificate to access your API.

          truststoreUri -> (string)
              An  Amazon  S3  URL that specifies the truststore for mutual TLS
              authentication,  for  example  s3://bucket-name/key-name  .  The
              truststore  can contain certificates from public or private cer-
              tificate authorities. To update the  truststore,  upload  a  new
              version  to  S3,  and then update your custom domain name to use
              the new version. To update the truststore, you must have permis-
              sions to access the S3 object.

          truststoreVersion -> (string)

              specify a version, you must have versioning enabled for  the  S3
              bucket.

          truststoreWarnings -> (list)
              A  list  of  warnings  that API Gateway returns while processing
              your truststore. Invalid certificates produce  warnings.  Mutual
              TLS  is  still  enabled,  but  some clients might not be able to
              access your API. To resolve warnings, upload a new truststore to
              S3, and then update you domain name to use the new version.

              (string)

       ownershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of the public certificate issued by ACM to validate owner-
          ship of your custom domain. Only required  when  configuring  mutual
          TLS  and  using an ACM imported or private CA certificate ARN as the
          regionalCertificateArn.
