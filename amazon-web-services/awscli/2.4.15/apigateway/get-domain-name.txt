GET-DOMAIN-NAME()                                            GET-DOMAIN-NAME()



NAME
       get-domain-name -

DESCRIPTION
       Represents a domain name that is contained in a simpler, more intuitive
       URL that can be called.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-name
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          [Required] The name of the  DomainName resource.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a custom domain name

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-domain-name --domain-name api.domain.tld

       Output:

          {
              "domainName": "api.domain.tld",
              "distributionDomainName": "d1a2f3a4c5o6d.cloudfront.net",
              "certificateName": "uploadedCertificate",
              "certificateUploadDate": 1462565487
          }

OUTPUT
       domainName -> (string)
          The  custom  domain  name  as  an  API  host  name,   for   example,
          my-api.example.com .

       certificateName -> (string)
          The name of the certificate that will be used by edge-optimized end-
          point for this domain name.

       certificateArn -> (string)
          The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that  will  be  used  by
          edge-optimized  endpoint  for this domain name. AWS Certificate Man-
          ager is the only supported source.

       certificateUploadDate -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp when the certificate that was used  by  edge-optimized
          endpoint for this domain name was uploaded.

       regionalDomainName -> (string)
          The  domain name associated with the regional endpoint for this cus-
          tom domain name. You set up this association by adding a DNS  record
          that points the custom domain name to this regional domain name. The
          regional domain name is returned by API Gateway when  you  create  a
          regional endpoint.

       regionalHostedZoneId -> (string)
          The  region-specific  Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the regional
          endpoint. For more information, see Set up a Regional Custom  Domain
          Name and AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway .

       regionalCertificateName -> (string)
          The  name  of  the  certificate that will be used for validating the
          regional domain name.

       regionalCertificateArn -> (string)
          The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will  be  used  for
          validating  the regional domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the
          only supported source.

       distributionDomainName -> (string)
          The domain name of the  Amazon  CloudFront  distribution  associated
          with this custom domain name for an edge-optimized endpoint. You set
          up this association when adding a DNS  record  pointing  the  custom
          domain  name  to  this distribution name. For more information about
          CloudFront distributions, see the Amazon CloudFront documentation  .

       distributionHostedZoneId -> (string)
          The region-agnostic Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the edge-opti-
          mized endpoint. The  valid  value  is  Z2FDTNDATAQYW2  for  all  the
          regions.  For  more information, see Set up a Regional Custom Domain
          Name and AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway .

       endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
          The endpoint configuration of this  DomainName showing the  endpoint
          types of the domain name.

          types -> (list)
              A  list  of  endpoint  types of an API ( RestApi ) or its custom
              domain name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized  API  and  its
              custom domain name, the endpoint type is "EDGE" . For a regional
              API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL  .
              For a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The  endpoint  type. The valid values are EDGE for edge-opti-
                 mized API  setup,  most  suitable  for  mobile  applications;
                 REGIONAL  for  regional API endpoint setup, most suitable for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A list of VpcEndpointIds of an API ( RestApi ) against which  to
              create  Route53  ALIASes.  It is only supported for PRIVATE end-
              point type.

              (string)

       domainNameStatus -> (string)
          The status of the  DomainName migration. The valid values are AVAIL-
          ABLE  , UPDATING , PENDING_CERTIFICATE_REIMPORT , and PENDING_OWNER-
          SHIP_VERIFICATION . If the status is UPDATING , the domain cannot be
          modified  further until the existing operation is complete. If it is
          AVAILABLE , the domain can be updated.

       domainNameStatusMessage -> (string)
          An optional text message containing detailed information about  sta-
          tus of the  DomainName migration.

       securityPolicy -> (string)
          The  Transport  Layer Security (TLS) version + cipher suite for this
          DomainName . The valid values are TLS_1_0 and TLS_1_2 .

       tags -> (map)
          The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a  given
          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       mutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
          The  mutual  TLS  authentication  configuration  for a custom domain
          name. If specified,  API  Gateway  performs  two-way  authentication
          between  the  client  and the server. Clients must present a trusted
          certificate to access your API.

          truststoreUri -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 URL that specifies the truststore  for  mutual  TLS
              authentication,  for  example  s3://bucket-name/key-name  .  The
              truststore can contain certificates from public or private  cer-
              tificate  authorities.  To  update  the truststore, upload a new
              version to S3, and then update your custom domain  name  to  use
              the new version. To update the truststore, you must have permis-
              sions to access the S3 object.

          truststoreVersion -> (string)
              The version of the S3 object that contains your  truststore.  To
              specify  a  version, you must have versioning enabled for the S3
              bucket.

          truststoreWarnings -> (list)
              A list of warnings that API  Gateway  returns  while  processing
              your  truststore.  Invalid certificates produce warnings. Mutual
              TLS is still enabled, but some clients  might  not  be  able  to
              access your API. To resolve warnings, upload a new truststore to
              S3, and then update you domain name to use the new version.

              (string)

       ownershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the public certificate issued by ACM to  validate  owner-
          ship  of  your  custom domain. Only required when configuring mutual
          TLS and using an ACM imported or private CA certificate ARN  as  the
          regionalCertificateArn.
