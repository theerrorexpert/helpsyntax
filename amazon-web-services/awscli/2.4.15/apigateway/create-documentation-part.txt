DESCRIPTION
       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-documentation-part
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --location <value>
          --properties <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --location (structure)
          [Required] The location of the targeted API entity of the to-be-cre-
          ated documentation part.

          type -> (string)
              [Required] The type of API entity  to  which  the  documentation
              content  applies.  Valid  values  are API , AUTHORIZER , MODEL ,
              RESOURCE  ,  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER   ,   QUERY_PARAMETER   ,
              REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY . Content inheritance does not apply to any entity
              of  the  API  ,  AUTHORIZER , METHOD , MODEL , REQUEST_BODY , or
              RESOURCE type.

          path -> (string)
              The URL path of the target. It is a  valid  field  for  the  API
              entity   types   of   RESOURCE   ,  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER  ,
              QUERY_PARAMETER , REQUEST_HEADER ,  REQUEST_BODY  ,  RESPONSE  ,
              RESPONSE_HEADER , and RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is / for
              the root resource. When an applicable child entity inherits  the
              content  of  another  entity  of the same type with more general
              specifications of  the  other  location  attributes,  the  child
              entity's  path attribute must match that of the parent entity as
              a prefix.

          method -> (string)
              The HTTP verb of a method. It is  a  valid  field  for  the  API
              entity  types  of  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER ,
              REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY  .  The default value is * for any method. When an
              applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of the
              same type with more general specifications of the other location
              attributes, the child entity's method attribute must match  that
              of the parent entity exactly.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The  HTTP status code of a response. It is a valid field for the
              API  entity  types  of  RESPONSE   ,   RESPONSE_HEADER   ,   and
              RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any status code. When
              an applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity  of
              the  same  type  with  more  general specifications of the other
              location attributes, the  child  entity's  statusCode  attribute
              must match that of the parent entity exactly.

          name -> (string)
              The  name of the targeted API entity. It is a valid and required
              field  for  the  API  entity  types  of  AUTHORIZER  ,  MODEL  ,
              PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER , REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY
              and RESPONSE_HEADER . It is  an  invalid  field  for  any  other
              entity type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,path=string,method=string,statusCode=string,name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "API"|"AUTHORIZER"|"MODEL"|"RESOURCE"|"METHOD"|"PATH_PARAMETER"|"QUERY_PARAMETER"|"REQUEST_HEADER"|"REQUEST_BODY"|"RESPONSE"|"RESPONSE_HEADER"|"RESPONSE_BODY",
            "path": "string",
            "method": "string",
            "statusCode": "string",
            "name": "string"
          }

       --properties (string)
          [Required]  The  new  documentation  content map of the targeted API
          entity. Enclosed key-value pairs are  API-specific,  but  only  Ope-
          nAPI-compliant  key-value  pairs  can  be  exported and, hence, pub-
          lished.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The  DocumentationPart identifier, generated by API Gateway when the
          DocumentationPart is created.

       location -> (structure)
          The  location  of the API entity to which the documentation applies.
          Valid fields depend on the targeted API entity type. All  the  valid
          location  fields  are  not  required. If not explicitly specified, a
          valid location field is treated as a wildcard and  associated  docu-
          mentation  content  may  be  inherited  by matching entities, unless
          overridden.

          type -> (string)
              [Required] The type of API entity  to  which  the  documentation
              content  applies.  Valid  values  are API , AUTHORIZER , MODEL ,
              RESOURCE  ,  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER   ,   QUERY_PARAMETER   ,
              REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY . Content inheritance does not apply to any entity
              of  the  API  ,  AUTHORIZER , METHOD , MODEL , REQUEST_BODY , or
              RESOURCE type.

          path -> (string)
              The URL path of the target. It is a  valid  field  for  the  API
              entity   types   of   RESOURCE   ,  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER  ,
              QUERY_PARAMETER , REQUEST_HEADER ,  REQUEST_BODY  ,  RESPONSE  ,
              RESPONSE_HEADER , and RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is / for
              the root resource. When an applicable child entity inherits  the
              content  of  another  entity  of the same type with more general
              specifications of  the  other  location  attributes,  the  child
              entity's  path attribute must match that of the parent entity as
              a prefix.

          method -> (string)
              The HTTP verb of a method. It is  a  valid  field  for  the  API
              entity  types  of  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER ,
              REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY  .  The default value is * for any method. When an
              applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of the
              same type with more general specifications of the other location
              attributes, the child entity's method attribute must match  that
              of the parent entity exactly.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The  HTTP status code of a response. It is a valid field for the
              API  entity  types  of  RESPONSE   ,   RESPONSE_HEADER   ,   and
              RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any status code. When
              an applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity  of
              the  same  type  with  more  general specifications of the other
              location attributes, the  child  entity's  statusCode  attribute
              must match that of the parent entity exactly.

          name -> (string)
              The  name of the targeted API entity. It is a valid and required
              field  for  the  API  entity  types  of  AUTHORIZER  ,  MODEL  ,

              and RESPONSE_HEADER . It is  an  invalid  field  for  any  other
              entity type.

       properties -> (string)
          A  content  map  of API-specific key-value pairs describing the tar-
          geted API entity. The map must be encoded as a JSON string, e.g., "{
          \"description\":  \"The  API  does ...\" }" . Only OpenAPI-compliant
          documentation-related fields from  the  propertiesmap  are  exported
          and,  hence,  published as part of the API entity definitions, while
          the original documentation parts are exported in a OpenAPI extension
          of x-amazon-apigateway-documentation .
