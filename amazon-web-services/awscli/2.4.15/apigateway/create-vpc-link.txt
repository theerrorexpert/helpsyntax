NAME
       create-vpc-link -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a VPC link, under the caller's account in a selected region, in
       an asynchronous operation that typically takes 2-4 minutes to  complete
       and  become operational. The caller must have permissions to create and
       update VPC Endpoint services.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-vpc-link
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --target-arns <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          [Required] The name used to label and identify the VPC link.

       --description (string)
          The description of the VPC link.

       --target-arns (list)
          [Required] The ARN of the network load balancer of the VPC  targeted
          by the VPC link. The network load balancer must be owned by the same
          AWS account of the API owner.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (map)
          The  key-value  map  of  strings.  The  valid   character   set   is
          [a-zA-Z+-=._:/].  The  tag  key can be up to 128 characters and must
          not start with aws: . The tag value can be up to 256 characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The identifier of the  VpcLink . It is used in  an   Integration  to
          reference this  VpcLink .

       name -> (string)
          The name used to label and identify the VPC link.

       description -> (string)
          The description of the VPC link.

       targetArns -> (list)
          The  ARN of the network load balancer of the VPC targeted by the VPC
          link. The network load balancer  must  be  owned  by  the  same  AWS
          account of the API owner.

          (string)

       status -> (string)
          The status of the VPC link. The valid values are AVAILABLE , PENDING
          , DELETING , or FAILED . Deploying an API will wait if the status is
          PENDING and will fail if the status is DELETING .

       statusMessage -> (string)
          A description about the VPC link status.

       tags -> (map)
          The  collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a given
