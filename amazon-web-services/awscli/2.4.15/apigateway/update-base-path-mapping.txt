NAME
       update-base-path-mapping -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes information about the  BasePathMapping resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-base-path-mapping
          --domain-name <value>
          --base-path <value>
          [--patch-operations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          [Required]  The  domain  name  of  the   BasePathMapping resource to
          change.

       --base-path (string)
          [Required] The base path of the  BasePathMapping resource to change.

          To specify an empty base path, set this parameter to '(none)' .

       --patch-operations (list)
          A  list of update operations to be applied to the specified resource
          and in the order specified in this list.

          (structure)
              A single patch operation to apply  to  the  specified  resource.
              Please refer to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4 for
              an explanation of how each operation is used.

              op -> (string)
                 An update operation to be performed with this PATCH  request.
                 The  valid  value can be add , remove , replace or copy . Not
                 all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Sup-
                 port  of  the operations depends on specific operational con-
                 texts. Attempts  to  apply  an  unsupported  operation  on  a
                 resource will return an error message.

              path -> (string)
                 The  op  operation's  target, as identified by a JSON Pointer
                 value  that  references  a  location  within   the   targeted
                 resource.  For example, if the target resource has an update-
                 able property of {"name":"value"} , the path for  this  prop-
                 erty  is  /name . If the name property value is a JSON object
                 (e.g., {"name": {"child/name": "child-value"}}  ),  the  path
                 for  the  child/name property will be /name/child~1name . Any
                 slash ("/") character appearing in path names must be escaped
                 with  "~1",  as shown in the example above. Each op operation
                 can have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The new target value of the update operation. It is  applica-
                 ble  for  the add or replace operation. When using AWS CLI to
                 update a property of a JSON value, enclose  the  JSON  object
                 with  a  pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., '{"a":
                 ...}'. In a Windows shell, see Using JSON for Parameters .

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer  value  referencing the location within the tar-
                 geted resource to copy the value from. For example,  to  pro-
                 mote  a  canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a   Stage  resource  with  "op":"copy"  , "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change the base path for a custom domain name

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-base-path-mapping --domain-name api.domain.tld --base-path prod --patch-operations op='replace',path='/basePath',value='v1'

       Output:

          {
              "basePath": "v1",
              "restApiId": "1234123412",
              "stage": "api"
          }

OUTPUT
       basePath -> (string)
          The base path name that callers of the API must provide as  part  of
          the URL after the domain name.

       restApiId -> (string)
          The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       stage -> (string)
          The name of the associated stage.
