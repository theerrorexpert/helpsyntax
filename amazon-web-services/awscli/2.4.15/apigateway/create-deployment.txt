          ate.

          input.

       --cache-cluster-size (string)
          Specifies  the  cache cluster size for the  Stage resource specified
          in the input, if a cache cluster is enabled.

          Possible values:

          o 1.6

       --variables (map)
          A map that defines the stage variables for the  Stage resource  that
          is  associated  with  the  new  deployment.  Variable names can have
          alphanumeric and underscore characters, and the  values  must  match
          [A-Za-z0-9-._~:/?#&=,]+ .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --canary-settings (structure)
          The  input  configuration for the canary deployment when the deploy-
          ment is a canary release deployment.

          percentTraffic -> (double)
              The percentage (0.0-100.0)  of  traffic  routed  to  the  canary
              deployment.

          stageVariableOverrides -> (map)
              A  stage  variable overrides used for the canary release deploy-
              ment. They can override existing  stage  variables  or  add  new
              stage  variables  for the canary release deployment. These stage
              variables are represented  as  a  string-to-string  map  between
              stage variable names and their values.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          useStageCache -> (boolean)
              A Boolean flag to indicate whether the canary release deployment
              uses the stage cache or not.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          percentTraffic=double,stageVariableOverrides={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},useStageCache=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "percentTraffic": double,
            "stageVariableOverrides": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "useStageCache": true|false
          }

       --tracing-enabled | --no-tracing-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether active tracing  with  X-ray  is  enabled  for  the
          Stage .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
