GET-DOCUMENTATION-PARTS()                            GET-DOCUMENTATION-PARTS()



NAME
       get-documentation-parts -

DESCRIPTION
       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-documentation-parts  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-documentation-parts
          --rest-api-id <value>
          [--type <value>]
          [--name-query <value>]
          [--path <value>]
          [--location-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --type (string)
          The type of API entities of the to-be-retrieved documentation parts.

          Possible values:

          o API

          o AUTHORIZER

          o MODEL

          o RESOURCE

          o METHOD

          o PATH_PARAMETER

          o QUERY_PARAMETER

          o REQUEST_HEADER

          o REQUEST_BODY

          o RESPONSE

          o RESPONSE_HEADER

          o RESPONSE_BODY

       --name-query (string)
          The name of API entities of the to-be-retrieved documentation parts.

       --path (string)
          The path of API entities of the to-be-retrieved documentation parts.

       --location-status (string)
          The  status of the API documentation parts to retrieve. Valid values
          are DOCUMENTED for retrieving  DocumentationPart resources with con-
          tent  and UNDOCUMENTED for  DocumentationPart resources without con-
          tent.

          Possible values:

          o DOCUMENTED

          o UNDOCUMENTED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              A documentation part for a targeted API entity.

              A documentation part consists of a content map (properties ) and
              a target (location ). The target  specifies  an  API  entity  to
              which  the  documentation  content  applies.  The  supported API
              entity types are API , AUTHORIZER , MODEL , RESOURCE , METHOD  ,
              PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER , REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY
              , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and RESPONSE_BODY .  Valid  loca-
              tion  fields depend on the API entity type. All valid fields are
              not required.

              The content map is  a  JSON  string  of  API-specific  key-value
              pairs.  Although  an  API can use any shape for the content map,
              only the OpenAPI-compliant documentation fields will be injected
              into  the  associated API entity definition in the exported Ope-
              nAPI definition file.
                 Documenting an API ,  DocumentationParts

              id -> (string)
                 The  DocumentationPart identifier, generated by  API  Gateway
                 when the DocumentationPart is created.

              location -> (structure)
                 The  location  of  the  API entity to which the documentation
                 applies. Valid fields depend on the targeted API entity type.
                 All  the  valid  location  fields  are  not  required. If not
                 explicitly specified, a valid location field is treated as  a
                 wildcard  and  associated documentation content may be inher-
                 ited by matching entities, unless overridden.

                 type -> (string)
                     [Required] The type of API entity to which the documenta-
                     tion content applies. Valid values are API , AUTHORIZER ,
                     MODEL , RESOURCE , METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAM-
                     ETER   ,  REQUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY  ,  RESPONSE  ,
                     RESPONSE_HEADER , and RESPONSE_BODY . Content inheritance
                     does  not  apply  to any entity of the API , AUTHORIZER ,
                     METHOD , MODEL , REQUEST_BODY , or RESOURCE type.

                 path -> (string)
                     The URL path of the target. It is a valid field  for  the
                     API  entity types of RESOURCE , METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER ,
                     QUERY_PARAMETER  ,  REQUEST_HEADER   ,   REQUEST_BODY   ,
                     RESPONSE  ,  RESPONSE_HEADER  ,  and  RESPONSE_BODY . The
                     default value is / for the root resource. When an  appli-
                     cable child entity inherits the content of another entity
                     of the same type with more general specifications of  the
                     other   location  attributes,  the  child  entity's  path
                     attribute must match that of the parent entity as a  pre-
                     fix.

                 method -> (string)
                     The  HTTP  verb  of a method. It is a valid field for the
                     API  entity  types   of   METHOD   ,   PATH_PARAMETER   ,
                     QUERY_PARAMETER   ,   REQUEST_HEADER   ,  REQUEST_BODY  ,
                     RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER  ,  and  RESPONSE_BODY  .  The
                     default  value  is  *  for any method. When an applicable
                     child entity inherits the content of  an  entity  of  the
                     same  type  with more general specifications of the other
                     location attributes, the child entity's method  attribute
                     must match that of the parent entity exactly.

                 statusCode -> (string)
                     The  HTTP  status code of a response. It is a valid field
                     for the API entity types of RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER  ,
                     and RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any status
                     code. When an applicable child entity inherits  the  con-
                     tent  of  an  entity  of  the same type with more general
                     specifications of  the  other  location  attributes,  the
                     child  entity's  statusCode  attribute must match that of
                     the parent entity exactly.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the targeted API entity. It is  a  valid  and
                     required  field  for the API entity types of AUTHORIZER ,
                     MODEL , PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER , REQUEST_HEADER
                     ,  REQUEST_BODY  and  RESPONSE_HEADER  . It is an invalid
                     field for any other entity type.

              properties -> (string)
                 A content map of API-specific key-value pairs describing  the
                 targeted  API  entity.  The  map  must  be  encoded as a JSON
                 string, e.g., "{ \"description\": \"The API does ...\"  }"  .
                 Only  OpenAPI-compliant documentation-related fields from the
                 propertiesmap are exported and, hence, published as  part  of
                 the  API entity definitions, while the original documentation
                 parts are exported in a OpenAPI  extension  of  x-amazon-api-
                 gateway-documentation .
