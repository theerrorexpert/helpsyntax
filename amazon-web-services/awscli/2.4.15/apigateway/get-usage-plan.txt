GET-USAGE-PLAN()                                              GET-USAGE-PLAN()



NAME
       get-usage-plan -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a usage plan of a given plan identifier.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-usage-plan
          --usage-plan-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-plan-id (string)
          [Required]   The   identifier  of  the   UsagePlan  resource  to  be
          retrieved.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The identifier of a  UsagePlan resource.

       name -> (string)
          The name of a usage plan.

       description -> (string)
          The description of a usage plan.

          The associated API stages of a usage plan.

          (structure)
              API stage name of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

              apiId -> (string)

              stage -> (string)
                 API stage name of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

              throttle -> (map)
                 Map containing method level throttling  information  for  API
                 stage in a usage plan.

                 value -> (structure)
                     The API request rate limits.

                     burstLimit -> (integer)
                        The  API  target request burst rate limit. This allows
                        more requests through for a period of  time  than  the
                        target rate limit.

                     rateLimit -> (double)
                        The API target request rate limit.

       throttle -> (structure)
          Map  containing method level throttling information for API stage in
          a usage plan.

          burstLimit -> (integer)
              The API target  request  burst  rate  limit.  This  allows  more
              requests  through  for  a  period  of  time than the target rate
              limit.

          rateLimit -> (double)
              The API target request rate limit.

       quota -> (structure)
          The target maximum number of permitted requests  per  a  given  unit
          time interval.

          limit -> (integer)
              The  target  maximum  number  of  requests that can be made in a
              given time period.

          offset -> (integer)
              The day that a time period starts.  For  example,  with  a  time
              period  of WEEK , an offset of 0 starts on Sunday, and an offset
              of 1 starts on Monday.

          period -> (string)
              The time period in which the limit  applies.  Valid  values  are
              "DAY", "WEEK" or "MONTH".

       productCode -> (string)
          The  AWS  Markeplace  product identifier to associate with the usage
          plan as a SaaS product on AWS Marketplace.

       tags -> (map)
