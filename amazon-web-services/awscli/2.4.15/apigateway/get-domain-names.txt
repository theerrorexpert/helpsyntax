GET-DOMAIN-NAMES()                                          GET-DOMAIN-NAMES()



NAME
       get-domain-names -

DESCRIPTION
       Represents a collection of  DomainName resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-domain-names  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-names
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of custom domain names

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-domain-names

       Output:

          {
              "items": [
                  {
                      "distributionDomainName": "d9511k3l09bkd.cloudfront.net",
                      "certificateUploadDate": 1452812505,
                      "certificateName": "my_custom_domain-certificate",
                      "domainName": "subdomain.domain.tld"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents  a custom domain name as a user-friendly host name of
              an API ( RestApi ).

              When you deploy an API, API Gateway creates a default host  name
              for   the   API.   This   default   API  host  name  is  of  the
              {restapi-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com format. With the
              default  host  name, you can access the API's root resource with
              the  URL  of   https://{restapi-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazon-
              aws.com/{stage}/  .  When  you  set  up  a custom domain name of
              apis.example.com for this API, you  can  then  access  the  same
              resource  using the URL of the https://apis.examples.com/myApi ,
              where myApi is the base path mapping ( BasePathMapping ) of your
              API under the custom domain name.

              domainName -> (string)
                 The  custom  domain  name  as  an API host name, for example,
                 my-api.example.com .

              certificateName -> (string)
                 The name of the certificate that will be used  by  edge-opti-
                 mized endpoint for this domain name.

              certificateArn -> (string)
                 The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used
                 by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certifi-
                 cate Manager is the only supported source.

              certificateUploadDate -> (timestamp)
                 The   timestamp   when  the  certificate  that  was  used  by
                 edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name was uploaded.

              regionalDomainName -> (string)
                 The domain name associated with  the  regional  endpoint  for
                 this  custom  domain  name.  You  set  up this association by
                 adding a DNS record that points the  custom  domain  name  to
                 this  regional  domain  name.  The  regional  domain  name is
                 returned by API Gateway when you create a regional  endpoint.

              regionalHostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The  region-specific  Amazon  Route  53 Hosted Zone ID of the
                 regional  endpoint.  For  more  information,  see  Set  up  a
                 Regional Custom Domain Name and AWS Regions and Endpoints for
                 API Gateway .

              regionalCertificateName -> (string)
                 The name of the certificate that will be used for  validating
                 the regional domain name.

              regionalCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used
                 for validating the regional domain name. AWS Certificate Man-

              distributionDomainName -> (string)
                 The domain name of the Amazon CloudFront distribution associ-
                 ated with this custom domain name for an edge-optimized  end-
                 point.  You  set up this association when adding a DNS record
                 pointing the custom domain name to  this  distribution  name.
                 For  more information about CloudFront distributions, see the
                 Amazon CloudFront documentation .

              distributionHostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The region-agnostic Amazon Route 53 Hosted  Zone  ID  of  the
                 edge-optimized  endpoint.  The  valid value is Z2FDTNDATAQYW2
                 for all the regions. For  more  information,  see  Set  up  a
                 Regional Custom Domain Name and AWS Regions and Endpoints for
                 API Gateway .

              endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The endpoint configuration of this   DomainName  showing  the
                 endpoint types of the domain name.

                 types -> (list)
                     A  list  of  endpoint  types of an API ( RestApi ) or its
                     custom domain name ( DomainName ). For an  edge-optimized
                     API  and  its  custom  domain  name, the endpoint type is
                     "EDGE" . For a regional API and its custom  domain  name,
                     the  endpoint  type  is REGIONAL . For a private API, the
                     endpoint type is PRIVATE .

                     (string)
                        The endpoint type.  The  valid  values  are  EDGE  for
                        edge-optimized  API  setup,  most  suitable for mobile
                        applications; REGIONAL for regional API endpoint  set-
                        up,  most  suitable  for  calling from AWS Region; and
                        PRIVATE for private APIs.

                 vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
                     A list of VpcEndpointIds of an API (  RestApi  )  against
                     which to create Route53 ALIASes. It is only supported for
                     PRIVATE endpoint type.

                     (string)

              domainNameStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the  DomainName migration. The valid values are
                 AVAILABLE  ,  UPDATING  ,  PENDING_CERTIFICATE_REIMPORT , and
                 PENDING_OWNERSHIP_VERIFICATION . If the status is UPDATING  ,
                 the  domain  cannot  be  modified  further until the existing
                 operation is complete. If it is AVAILABLE , the domain can be
                 updated.

              domainNameStatusMessage -> (string)
                 An  optional  text  message  containing  detailed information
                 about status of the  DomainName migration.

                 The Transport Layer Security (TLS) version + cipher suite for
                 this  DomainName . The valid values are TLS_1_0 and TLS_1_2 .

              tags -> (map)
                 The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a
                 given resource.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              mutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
                 The  mutual  TLS  authentication  configuration  for a custom
                 domain name.  If  specified,  API  Gateway  performs  two-way
                 authentication  between  the  client  and the server. Clients
                 must present a trusted certificate to access your API.

                 truststoreUri -> (string)
                     An Amazon S3 URL that specifies the truststore for mutual
                     TLS authentication, for example s3://bucket-name/key-name
                     . The truststore can contain certificates from public  or
                     private  certificate  authorities.  To  update the trust-
                     store, upload a new version to S3, and then  update  your
                     custom  domain name to use the new version. To update the
                     truststore, you must have permissions to  access  the  S3
                     object.

                 truststoreVersion -> (string)
                     The  version  of  the S3 object that contains your trust-
                     store. To specify a version,  you  must  have  versioning
                     enabled for the S3 bucket.

                 truststoreWarnings -> (list)
                     A  list  of  warnings that API Gateway returns while pro-
                     cessing your  truststore.  Invalid  certificates  produce
                     warnings.  Mutual  TLS is still enabled, but some clients
                     might not be able to access your API.  To  resolve  warn-
                     ings,  upload a new truststore to S3, and then update you
                     domain name to use the new version.

                     (string)

              ownershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the public certificate issued by ACM  to  validate
                 ownership of your custom domain. Only required when configur-
                 ing mutual TLS and using an ACM imported or private  CA  cer-
                 tificate ARN as the regionalCertificateArn.
