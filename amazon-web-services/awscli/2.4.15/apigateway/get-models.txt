GET-MODELS()                                                      GET-MODELS()



NAME
       get-models -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes existing  Models defined for a  RestApi resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-models  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-models
          --rest-api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of models for a REST API

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-models --rest-api-id 1234123412

       Output:

          {
              "items": [
                  {
                      "description": "This is a default error schema model",
                      "schema": "{\n  \"$schema\" : \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n  \"title\" : \"Error Schema\",\n  \"type\" : \"object\",\n  \"properties\" : {\n    \"message\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }\n  }\n}",
                      "contentType": "application/json",
                      "id": "7tpbze",
                      "name": "Error"
                  },
                  {
                      "description": "This is a default empty schema model",
                      "schema": "{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n  \"title\" : \"Empty Schema\",\n  \"type\" : \"object\"\n}",
                      "contentType": "application/json",
                      "id": "etd5w5",
                      "name": "Empty"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents  the data structure of a method's request or response
              payload.

              A request model defines the data structure  of  the  client-sup-
              plied  request payload. A response model defines the data struc-
              ture of the response payload returned by the back end.  Although
              not required, models are useful for mapping payloads between the
              front end and back end.

              A model is used for generating  an  API's  SDK,  validating  the
              input request body, and creating a skeletal mapping template.

              id -> (string)
                 The identifier for the model resource.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the model. Must be an alphanumeric string.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the model.

              schema -> (string)
                 The  schema  for the model. For application/json models, this
                 should be JSON schema draft 4  model.  Do  not  include  "*/"
                 characters  in the description of any properties because such
                 "*/" characters may be interpreted as the closing marker  for
                 comments in some languages, such as Java or JavaScript, caus-
                 ing the installation of your API's SDK generated by API Gate-
                 way to fail.

              contentType -> (string)
                 The content-type for the model.
