NAME
       export-components -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  component  configurations  to  code that is ready to integrate
       into an Amplify app.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            export-components
          --app-id <value>
          --environment-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID of the Amplify app to export components to.

       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the backend environment that is a part  of  the  Amplify
          app.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       entities -> (list)
          Represents the configuration of the exported components.

          (structure)
              Contains  the  configuration  settings for a user interface (UI)
              element for an Amplify app. A component is configured as a  pri-
              mary, stand-alone UI element. Use ComponentChild to configure an
              instance of a Component . A ComponentChild instance inherits the
              configuration of the main Component .

              appId -> (string)
                 The  unique  ID of the Amplify app associated with the compo-
                 nent.

                     to add exposed properties to a component to allow differ-
                     ent values to be entered when a component  is  reused  in
