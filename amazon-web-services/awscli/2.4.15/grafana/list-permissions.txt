LIST-PERMISSIONS()                                          LIST-PERMISSIONS()



NAME
       list-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the users and groups who have the Grafana Admin and Editor roles
       in this workspace. If you use this operation without specifying  userId
       or  groupId  , the operation returns the roles of all users and groups.
       If you specify a userId or a groupId , only the roles for that user  or
       group  are returned. If you do this, you can specify only one userId or
       one groupId .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-permissions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: permissions

SYNOPSIS
            list-permissions
          [--group-id <value>]
          [--user-id <value>]
          [--user-type <value>]
          --workspace-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-id (string)
          (Optional)  Limits  the  results to only the group that matches this
          ID.

       --user-id (string)
          (Optional) Limits the results to only the user that matches this ID.

       --user-type (string)
          (Optional)  If  you  specify SSO_USER , then only the permissions of
          Amazon Web Services SSO users are returned. If you specify SSO_GROUP
          ,  only  the  permissions  of  Amazon  Web  Services  SSO groups are
          returned.

          Possible values:

          o SSO_USER

          o SSO_GROUP

       --workspace-id (string)
          The ID of the workspace to list permissions for. This  parameter  is
          required.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use in a subsequent ListPermissions operation to return
          the next set of results.

       permissions -> (list)
          The permissions returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              A structure containing the identity of one user or group and the
              Admin or Editor role that they have.

              role -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the user or group has the Admin  or  Editor
                 role.

              user -> (structure)
                 A  structure with the ID of the user or group with this role.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the user or group.

                 type -> (string)
