NAME
       update-workspace -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  an existing Amazon Managed Grafana workspace. If you use this
       operation and omit any optional  parameters,  the  existing  values  of
       those parameters are not changed.

       To modify the user authentication methods that the workspace uses, such
       as SAML or Amazon Web Services SSO, use UpdateWorkspaceAuthentication .

       To  modify  which  users  in  the  workspace  have the Admin and Editor
       Grafana roles, use UpdatePermissions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-workspace
          [--account-access-type <value>]
          [--organization-role-name <value>]
          [--permission-type <value>]
          [--stack-set-name <value>]
          [--workspace-data-sources <value>]
          [--workspace-description <value>]
          --workspace-id <value>
          [--workspace-name <value>]
          [--workspace-notification-destinations <value>]
          [--workspace-organizational-units <value>]
          [--workspace-role-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-access-type (string)
          Specifies whether the  workspace  can  access  Amazon  Web  Services
          resources  in  this  Amazon Web Services account only, or whether it
          can also access Amazon Web Services resources in other  accounts  in
          the  same organization. If you specify ORGANIZATION , you must spec-
          ify which organizational units  the  workspace  can  access  in  the
          workspaceOrganizationalUnits parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CURRENT_ACCOUNT

          o ORGANIZATION

       --organization-role-name (string)
          The  name  of  an  IAM  role  that  already  exists to use to access
          resources through Organizations.

       --permission-type (string)
          If you specify Service Managed , Amazon  Managed  Grafana  automati-
          cally  creates the IAM roles and provisions the permissions that the
          workspace needs to use Amazon Web Services data sources and  notifi-
          cation channels.

          If  you  specify  CUSTOMER_MANAGED , you will manage those roles and
          permissions yourself. If you are creating this workspace in a member
          account  of  an  organization  and  that  account is not a delegated
          administrator account, and you want the  workspace  to  access  data
          sources  in  other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organization,
          you must choose CUSTOMER_MANAGED .

          For more information, see Amazon  Managed  Grafana  permissions  and
          policies for Amazon Web Services data sources and notification chan-
          nels

          Possible values:

          o CUSTOMER_MANAGED

          o SERVICE_MANAGED

       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name of the CloudFormation stack set  to  use  to  generate  IAM
          roles to be used for this workspace.

       --workspace-data-sources (list)
          Specify  the  Amazon  Web  Services data sources that you want to be
          queried in  this  workspace.  Specifying  these  data  sources  here
          enables  Amazon  Managed Grafana to create IAM roles and permissions
          that allow Amazon Managed Grafana to read data from  these  sources.
          You  must  still  add them as data sources in the Grafana console in
          the workspace.

          If you don't specify a data source here, you can still add it  as  a
          data  source  later in the workspace console. However, you will then
          have to manually configure permissions for it.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AMAZON_OPENSEARCH_SERVICE
            CLOUDWATCH
            PROMETHEUS
            XRAY
            TIMESTREAM
            SITEWISE

       --workspace-description (string)
          A description for the workspace. This is used only to help you iden-
          tify this workspace.

       --workspace-id (string)
          The ID of the workspace to update.

       --workspace-name (string)
          A new name for the workspace to update.

       --workspace-notification-destinations (list)
          Specify  the Amazon Web Services notification channels that you plan
          to use in this workspace. Specifying these data sources here enables
          Amazon  Managed  Grafana  to  create  IAM roles and permissions that
          allow Amazon Managed Grafana to use these channels.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SNS

       --workspace-organizational-units (list)
          Specifies the organizational units that this workspace is allowed to
          use  data  sources  from, if this workspace is in an account that is
          part of an organization.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --workspace-role-arn (string)
          The workspace needs an IAM role that grants permissions to the  Ama-
          zon  Web  Services resources that the workspace will view data from.
          If you already have a role that you want to use, specify it here. If
          you  omit  this  field  and  you  specify  some  Amazon Web Services
          resources in workspaceDataSources  or  workspaceNotificationDestina-
          tions  ,  a new IAM role with the necessary permissions is automati-
          cally created.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
