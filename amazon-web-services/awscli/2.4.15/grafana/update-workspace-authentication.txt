NAME
       update-workspace-authentication -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  operation  to  define  the identity provider (IdP) that this
       workspace authenticates users from, using SAML. You can also  map  SAML
       assertion  attributes  to  workspace  user information and define which
       groups in the assertion attribute are to  have  the  Admin  and  Editor
       roles in the workspace.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-workspace-authentication

          --workspace-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authentication-providers (list)
          Specifies  whether this workspace uses SAML 2.0, Amazon Web Services
          Single Sign On, or both to authenticate users for using the  Grafana
          console within a workspace. For more information, see User authenti-
          cation in Amazon Managed Grafana .

       --saml-configuration (structure)
          If the workspace uses SAML, use this structure to map SAML assertion
          attributes  to workspace user information and define which groups in

              Lists  which  organizations  defined  in  the SAML assertion are
              allowed to use the Amazon Managed Grafana workspace. If this  is

          roleValues -> (structure)
              A  structure  containing arrays that map group names in the SAML
              assertion  to  the  Grafana  Admin  and  Editor  roles  in   the

              "email": "string",
              "groups": "string",
              "login": "string",
              "name": "string",
              "org": "string",
              "role": "string"
            },

       --workspace-id (string)
          The ID of the workspace to update the authentication for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
