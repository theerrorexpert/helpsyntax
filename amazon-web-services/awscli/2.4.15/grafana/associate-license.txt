SYNOPSIS
            associate-license
          --license-type <value>
          --workspace-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --license-type (string)
          The type of license to associate with the workspace.

          Possible values:

          o ENTERPRISE

          o ENTERPRISE_FREE_TRIAL

       --workspace-id (string)
          The ID of the workspace to associate the license with.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              If this is CUSTOMER_MANAGED , you manage those roles and permis-
              sions yourself. If you are creating this workspace in  a  member
              account  of  an organization and that account is not a delegated
              administrator account, and you want the workspace to access data
              sources  in  other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organiza-
              tion, you must choose CUSTOMER_MANAGED .
