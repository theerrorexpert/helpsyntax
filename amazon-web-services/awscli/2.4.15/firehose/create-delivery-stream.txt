CREATE-DELIVERY-STREAM()                              CREATE-DELIVERY-STREAM()



NAME
       create-delivery-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

       By default, you can create up to 50 delivery streams per AWS Region.

       This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial
       status of the delivery stream is CREATING . After the  delivery  stream
       is created, its status is ACTIVE and it now accepts data. If the deliv-
       ery stream creation fails, the status transitions to CREATING_FAILED  .
       Attempts  to  send  data to a delivery stream that is not in the ACTIVE
       state cause an exception. To check the state of a delivery stream,  use
       DescribeDeliveryStream .

       If  the  status  of  a delivery stream is CREATING_FAILED , this status
       doesn't change, and you can't invoke CreateDeliveryStream again on  it.
       However,  you  can invoke the  DeleteDeliveryStream operation to delete
       it.

       A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be  configured  to  receive
       records  directly  from providers using  PutRecord or  PutRecordBatch ,
       or it can be configured to  use  an  existing  Kinesis  stream  as  its
       source.  To  specify a Kinesis data stream as input, set the DeliveryS-
       treamType parameter to KinesisStreamAsSource , and provide the  Kinesis
       stream  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) and role ARN in the KinesisStream-
       SourceConfiguration parameter.

       To create a delivery stream with server-side encryption (SSE)  enabled,
       include   DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput  in  your request.
       This is optional. You can also invoke  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption to
       turn  on  SSE  for  an  existing  delivery stream that doesn't have SSE
       enabled.

       A delivery stream is configured with a single destination:  Amazon  S3,
       Amazon ES, Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must specify only one of the
       following destination configuration parameters:  ExtendedS3Destination-
       Configuration  , S3DestinationConfiguration , ElasticsearchDestination-
       Configuration , RedshiftDestinationConfiguration  ,  or  SplunkDestina-
       tionConfiguration .

       When  you specify S3DestinationConfiguration , you can also provide the
       following optional values:  BufferingHints,  EncryptionConfiguration  ,
       and  CompressionFormat . By default, if no BufferingHints value is pro-
       vided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5  minutes,
       whichever  condition  is  satisfied first. BufferingHints is a hint, so
       there are some cases where the service cannot adhere  to  these  condi-
       tions  strictly.  For example, record boundaries might be such that the
       size is a little over  or  under  the  configured  buffering  size.  By
       default,  no  encryption  is  performed. We strongly recommend that you
       enable encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3.

       A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination:

       o An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as  intermediate
         location.  Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and
         then uses COPY syntax to load data into  an  Amazon  Redshift  table.
         This  is specified in the RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configu-
         ration parameter.

       o The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot  be  specified  in  Red-
         shiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration because the Amazon Red-
         shift COPY operation that reads from the S3  bucket  doesn't  support
         these compression formats.

       o We  strongly  recommend  that  you use the user name and password you
         provide exclusively with Kinesis Data Firehose, and that the  permis-
         sions  for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift INSERT per-
         missions.

       Kinesis Data Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured  as  part
       of  the  destination.  The  role should allow the Kinesis Data Firehose
       principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that
       allow  the service to deliver the data. For more information, see Grant
       Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination in the  Amazon
       Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The  name  of  the delivery stream. This name must be unique per AWS
          account in the same AWS Region. If the delivery streams are in  dif-
          ferent accounts or different Regions, you can have multiple delivery
          streams with the same name.

       --delivery-stream-type (string)
          The delivery stream type. This parameter can be one of the following
          values:

          o DirectPut  :  Provider  applications  access  the  delivery stream
            directly.

          o KinesisStreamAsSource : The delivery stream uses  a  Kinesis  data
            stream as a source.

          Possible values:

          o DirectPut

          o KinesisStreamAsSource

       --kinesis-stream-source-configuration (structure)
          When  a  Kinesis  data stream is used as the source for the delivery
          stream, a  KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration containing  the  Kinesis
          data  stream  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) and the role ARN for the
          source stream.

          KinesisStreamARN -> (string)
              The ARN of the source Kinesis data stream. For more information,
              see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams ARN Format .

          RoleARN -> (string)
              The  ARN  of the role that provides access to the source Kinesis
              data stream. For more information, see AWS Identity  and  Access
              Management (IAM) ARN Format .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KinesisStreamARN=string,RoleARN=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KinesisStreamARN": "string",
            "RoleARN": "string"
          }

       --delivery-stream-encryption-configuration-input (structure)
          Used  to  specify the type and Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS
          key needed for Server-Side Encryption (SSE).

          KeyARN -> (string)
              If you set KeyType to CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK ,  you  must  specify
              the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK. If you set KeyType to
              AWS_OWNED_CMK , Kinesis Data  Firehose  uses  a  service-account
              CMK.

          KeyType -> (string)
              Indicates  the  type  of  customer  master  key (CMK) to use for
              encryption. The default setting  is  AWS_OWNED_CMK  .  For  more
              information  about  CMKs, see Customer Master Keys (CMKs) . When
              you invoke  CreateDeliveryStream or   StartDeliveryStreamEncryp-
              tion  with  KeyType  set  to  CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK, Kinesis Data
              Firehose invokes the Amazon KMS operation CreateGrant to  create
              a grant that allows the Kinesis Data Firehose service to use the
              customer managed CMK to perform encryption and decryption. Kine-
              sis Data Firehose manages that grant.

              When you invoke  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption to change the CMK
              for a delivery stream that is encrypted with a customer  managed
              CMK, Kinesis Data Firehose schedules the grant it had on the old
              CMK for retirement.

              You can use a CMK of type CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK to encrypt up  to
              500 delivery streams. If a  CreateDeliveryStream or  StartDeliv-
              eryStreamEncryption operation exceeds this limit,  Kinesis  Data
              Firehose throws a LimitExceededException .

              WARNING:
                 To  encrypt your delivery stream, use symmetric CMKs. Kinesis
                 Data Firehose doesn't support asymmetric CMKs.  For  informa-
                 tion about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see About Symmetric
                 and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service  devel-
                 oper guide.

              The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically used for
              delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix,
              as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

          ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
              A prefix that Kinesis Data Firehose evaluates and adds to failed
              records before writing them to S3. This prefix  appears  immedi-
              ately  following  the  bucket name. For information about how to
              specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints
              object default values are used.

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in  MiBs,  before
                 delivering  it  to  the  destination. The default value is 5.
                 This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it,
                 you  must  also  specify  a value for IntervalInSeconds , and
                 vice versa.

                 We recommend setting this parameter to a value  greater  than
                 the  amount  of  data  you typically ingest into the delivery
                 stream in 10 seconds. For example, if  you  typically  ingest
                 data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer  incoming  data  for  the specified period of time, in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a
                 value for it, you must also specify a value for  SizeInMBs  ,
                 and vice versa.

          CompressionFormat -> (string)
              The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is
              UNCOMPRESSED .

              The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot  be  specified  for
              Amazon  Redshift  destinations because they are not supported by
              the Amazon Redshift  COPY  operation  that  reads  from  the  S3
              bucket.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  encryption  configuration.  If  no  value is specified, the
              default is no encryption.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS credentials. For
                 more information, see Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)  and  AWS
                 Service Namespaces .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information, see Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that  Kinesis  Data Firehose evaluates and adds to
                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately  following the bucket name. For information about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data to  the  specified  size,  in  MiBs,
                     before  delivering  it  to  the  destination. The default
                     value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify
                     a  value for it, you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than  the  amount  of  data you typically ingest into the
                     delivery stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds,  before  delivering  it  to the destination. The
                     default value is 300. This parameter is optional  but  if
                     you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value
                     for SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon Redshift destinations because they are  not  supported
                 by  the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration. If no value is  specified,  the
                 default is no encryption.

                 NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                     Specifically  override existing encryption information to
                     ensure that no encryption is used.

                 KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                     The encryption key.

                     AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption  key.
                        Must  belong to the same AWS Region as the destination
                        Amazon S3 bucket. For  more  information,  see  Amazon
                        Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

              CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch logging options for your delivery stream.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                 LogGroupName -> (string)
                     The  CloudWatch  group  name  for  logging. This value is
                     required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

                 LogStreamName -> (string)
                     The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is
                     required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          DataFormatConversionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  serializer,  deserializer,  and  schema for converting data
              from the JSON format to the Parquet or ORC format before writing
              it to Amazon S3.

              SchemaConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  AWS Glue Data Catalog table that contains the
                 column information. This parameter is required if Enabled  is
                 set to true.

                 RoleARN -> (string)
                     The role that Kinesis Data Firehose can use to access AWS
                     Glue. This role must be in the same account you  use  for
                     Kinesis   Data   Firehose.   Cross-account  roles  aren't
                     allowed.

                     WARNING:
                        If the SchemaConfiguration request parameter  is  used
                        as part of invoking the CreateDeliveryStream API, then
                        the RoleARN property is required and its value must be
                        specified.

                 CatalogId -> (string)
                     The  ID of the AWS Glue Data Catalog. If you don't supply
                     this, the AWS account ID is used by default.

                 DatabaseName -> (string)
                     Specifies the name of the AWS Glue database that contains
                     the schema for the output data.

                     WARNING:
                        If  the  SchemaConfiguration request parameter is used
                        as part of invoking the CreateDeliveryStream API, then
                        the  DatabaseName  property  is required and its value
                        must be specified.

                 TableName -> (string)
                     Specifies the AWS Glue table  that  contains  the  column
                     information that constitutes your data schema.

                     WARNING:
                        If  the  SchemaConfiguration request parameter is used
                        as part of invoking the CreateDeliveryStream API, then
                        the  TableName property is required and its value must
                        be specified.

                 Region -> (string)
                     If you don't specify an AWS Region, the  default  is  the
                     current Region.

                 VersionId -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  table version for the output data schema.
                     If you don't specify this version ID, or if you set it to
                     LATEST  , Kinesis Data Firehose uses the most recent ver-
                     sion. This means that any updates to the table are  auto-
                     matically picked up.

              InputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  deserializer that you want Kinesis Data Fire-
                 hose to use to convert the format of  your  data  from  JSON.
                 This parameter is required if Enabled is set to true.

                 Deserializer -> (structure)
                     Specifies  which  deserializer  to  use.  You  can choose
                     either the Apache Hive  JSON  SerDe  or  the  OpenX  JSON
                     SerDe.  If  both  are  non-null,  the  server rejects the
                     request.

                     OpenXJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                        The OpenX SerDe. Used by  Kinesis  Data  Firehose  for
                        deserializing data, which means converting it from the
                        JSON format in preparation for serializing it  to  the
                        Parquet  or ORC format. This is one of two deserializ-
                        ers you can choose, depending on which one offers  the
                        functionality you need. The other option is the native
                        Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe.

                        ConvertDotsInJsonKeysToUnderscores -> (boolean)
                            When set to true , specifies that the names of the
                            keys  include  dots and that you want Kinesis Data
                            Firehose to replace them with underscores. This is
                            useful  because Apache Hive does not allow dots in
                            column names. For example, if the JSON contains  a
                            key whose name is "a.b", you can define the column
                            name to be "a_b" when using this option.

                            The default is false .

                        CaseInsensitive -> (boolean)
                            When set to true , which is the  default,  Kinesis
                            Data  Firehose  converts  JSON  keys  to lowercase
                            before deserializing them.

                        ColumnToJsonKeyMappings -> (map)
                            Maps column names to JSON keys that aren't identi-
                            cal  to  the column names. This is useful when the
                            JSON contains keys that  are  Hive  keywords.  For
                            example,  timestamp is a Hive keyword. If you have
                            a JSON key named timestamp , set this parameter to
                            {"ts":  "timestamp"}  to  map this key to a column
                            named ts .

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                     HiveJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                        The native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. Used by  Kinesis
                        Data Firehose for deserializing data, which means con-
                        verting it from the JSON  format  in  preparation  for
                        serializing  it  to the Parquet or ORC format. This is
                        one of two deserializers you can choose, depending  on
                        which one offers the functionality you need. The other
                        option is the OpenX SerDe.

                        TimestampFormats -> (list)
                            Indicates how you want Kinesis  Data  Firehose  to
                            parse  the date and timestamps that may be present
                            in your input data JSON. To specify  these  format
                            strings,  follow  the pattern syntax of JodaTime's
                            DateTimeFormat format strings. For  more  informa-
                            tion,  see Class DateTimeFormat . You can also use
                            the special value millis to  parse  timestamps  in
                            epoch milliseconds. If you don't specify a format,
                            Kinesis   Data   Firehose   uses    java.sql.Time-
                            stamp::valueOf by default.

                            (string)

              OutputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the serializer that you want Kinesis Data Firehose
                 to use to convert the format of your data to the  Parquet  or
                 ORC  format.  This parameter is required if Enabled is set to
                 true.

                 Serializer -> (structure)
                     Specifies which serializer to use. You can choose  either
                     the ORC SerDe or the Parquet SerDe. If both are non-null,
                     the server rejects the request.

                     ParquetSerDe -> (structure)
                        A serializer to use for converting data to the Parquet
                        format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more infor-
                        mation, see Apache Parquet .

                        BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The Hadoop Distributed File  System  (HDFS)  block
                            size.  This  is  useful  if you intend to copy the
                            data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before  querying.  The
                            default  is  256  MiB  and  the minimum is 64 MiB.
                            Kinesis Data Firehose uses this value for  padding
                            calculations.

                        PageSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The  Parquet  page size. Column chunks are divided
                            into pages. A page is conceptually an  indivisible
                            unit  (in  terms of compression and encoding). The
                            minimum value is 64 KiB and the default is 1  MiB.

                        Compression -> (string)
                            The  compression code to use over data blocks. The
                            possible values are UNCOMPRESSED ,  SNAPPY  ,  and
                            GZIP  , with the default being SNAPPY . Use SNAPPY
                            for higher decompression speed. Use  GZIP  if  the
                            compression ratio is more important than speed.

                        EnableDictionaryCompression -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether  to  enable dictionary compres-
                            sion.

                        MaxPaddingBytes -> (integer)
                            The maximum amount of padding to  apply.  This  is
                            useful  if you intend to copy the data from Amazon
                            S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is 0.

                        WriterVersion -> (string)
                            Indicates the version of row format to output. The
                            possible  values are V1 and V2 . The default is V1
                            .

                     OrcSerDe -> (structure)
                        A serializer to use for converting  data  to  the  ORC
                        format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more infor-
                        mation, see Apache ORC .

                        StripeSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The number of bytes in each stripe. The default is
                            64 MiB and the minimum is 8 MiB.

                        BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The  Hadoop  Distributed  File System (HDFS) block
                            size. This is useful if you  intend  to  copy  the
                            data  from  Amazon S3 to HDFS before querying. The
                            default is 256 MiB and  the  minimum  is  64  MiB.
                            Kinesis  Data Firehose uses this value for padding
                            calculations.

                        RowIndexStride -> (integer)
                            The number of  rows  between  index  entries.  The
                            default is 10,000 and the minimum is 1,000.

                        EnablePadding -> (boolean)
                            Set this to true to indicate that you want stripes
                            to be padded to the HDFS block boundaries. This is
                            useful  if you intend to copy the data from Amazon
                            S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is false .

                        PaddingTolerance -> (double)
                            A  number  between 0 and 1 that defines the toler-
                            ance for block padding as a  decimal  fraction  of
                            stripe  size.  The  default  value  is 0.05, which
                            means 5 percent of stripe size.

                            For the default values of 64 MiB ORC  stripes  and
                            256  MiB  HDFS  blocks,  the default block padding
                            tolerance of 5 percent reserves a maximum  of  3.2
                            MiB  for padding within the 256 MiB block. In such
                            a case, if the available size within the block  is
                            more  than  3.2  MiB,  a  new,  smaller  stripe is
                            inserted to fit within that  space.  This  ensures
                            that no stripe crosses block boundaries and causes
                            remote reads within a node-local task.

                            Kinesis Data Firehose ignores this parameter  when
                            OrcSerDe$EnablePadding is false .

                        Compression -> (string)
                            The  compression code to use over data blocks. The
                            default is SNAPPY .

                        BloomFilterColumns -> (list)
                            The column names for which you want  Kinesis  Data
                            Firehose  to  create bloom filters. The default is
                            null .

                            (string)

                        BloomFilterFalsePositiveProbability -> (double)
                            The Bloom filter false positive probability (FPP).
                            The  lower  the  FPP, the bigger the Bloom filter.
                            The default value is 0.05, the minimum is  0,  and
                            the maximum is 1.

                        DictionaryKeyThreshold -> (double)
                            Represents  the  fraction  of  the total number of
                            non-null rows. To turn  off  dictionary  encoding,
                            set  this  fraction  to a number that is less than
                            the number of distinct keys in  a  dictionary.  To
                            always use dictionary encoding, set this threshold
                            to 1.

                        FormatVersion -> (string)
                            The version of the file  to  write.  The  possible
                            values  are V0_11 and V0_12 . The default is V0_12
                            .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Defaults to true . Set it to false if  you  want  to  disable
                 format conversion while preserving the configuration details.

          DynamicPartitioningConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration of the  dynamic  partitioning  mechanism  that
              creates  smaller data sets from the streaming data by partition-
              ing it based on partition keys. Currently, dynamic  partitioning
              is  only supported for Amazon S3 destinations. For more informa-
              tion,                                                        see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/dynamic-partitioning.html

              RetryOptions -> (structure)
                 The retry behavior in case Kinesis Data Firehose is unable to
                 deliver data to an Amazon S3 prefix.

                     The  period  of  time  during which Kinesis Data Firehose
                     retries to deliver data to the specified Amazon  S3  pre-
                     fix.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  that  the dynamic partitioning is enabled for this
                 Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

              CopyOptions -> (string)
                 Optional parameters to use with the Amazon Redshift COPY com-
                 mand.  For  more  information,  see the "Optional Parameters"
                 section of Amazon Redshift COPY command . Some possible exam-
                 ples  that  would  apply to Kinesis Data Firehose are as fol-
                 lows:
                     delimiter '\t' lzop; - fields are delimited with "t" (TAB
                     character) and compressed using lzop.

                     delimiter  '|'  -  fields are delimited with "|" (this is
                     the default delimiter).

                     delimiter '|' escape - the delimiter should be escaped.

              The user password.

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              The  retry  behavior  in case Kinesis Data Firehose is unable to
              deliver documents to Amazon Redshift. Default value is 3600  (60
              minutes).

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The length of time during which Kinesis Data Firehose retries
                 delivery after a failure, starting from the  initial  request
                 and  including  the  first attempt. The default value is 3600
                 seconds (60 minutes). Kinesis Data Firehose does not retry if
                 the  value  of  DurationInSeconds is 0 (zero) or if the first
                 delivery attempt takes longer than the current value.

          S3Configuration -> (structure)
              The configuration for the intermediate Amazon S3  location  from
              which  Amazon  Redshift obtains data. Restrictions are described
              in the topic for  CreateDeliveryStream .

              The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP  cannot  be  specified  in
              RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration   because   the
              Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads  from  the  S3  bucket
              doesn't support these compression formats.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS credentials. For
                 more information, see Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)  and  AWS
                 Service Namespaces .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information, see Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that  Kinesis  Data Firehose evaluates and adds to
                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately  following the bucket name. For information about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data to  the  specified  size,  in  MiBs,
                     before  delivering  it  to  the  destination. The default
                     value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify
                     a  value for it, you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than  the  amount  of  data you typically ingest into the
                     delivery stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds,  before  delivering  it  to the destination. The
                     default value is 300. This parameter is optional  but  if
                     you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value
                     for SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon Redshift destinations because they are  not  supported
                 by  the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration. If no value is  specified,  the
                 default is no encryption.

                 NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                     Specifically  override existing encryption information to
                     ensure that no encryption is used.

                 KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                     The encryption key.

                     AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption  key.
                        Must  belong to the same AWS Region as the destination
                        Amazon S3 bucket. For  more  information,  see  Amazon
                        Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

              The Elasticsearch type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x, there can be
              only one type per index. If you try to specify a new type for an
              existing index that already has another type, Kinesis Data Fire-
              hose returns an error during run time.

              For Elasticsearch 7.x, don't specify a TypeName .

          IndexRotationPeriod -> (string)
              The  Elasticsearch index rotation period. Index rotation appends
              a timestamp to the IndexName to facilitate the expiration of old
              data. For more information, see Index Rotation for the Amazon ES
              Destination . The default value is OneDay .

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The buffering options. If no value  is  specified,  the  default
              values for ElasticsearchBufferingHints are used.

                 delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5.

                 We recommend setting this parameter to a value  greater  than
                 the  amount  of  data  you typically ingest into the delivery
                 stream in 10 seconds. For example, if  you  typically  ingest
                 data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher.

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              The  retry  behavior  in case Kinesis Data Firehose is unable to
              deliver documents to Amazon ES. The default value is 300 (5 min-
              utes).

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 After  an  initial failure to deliver to Amazon ES, the total
                 amount of time during which  Kinesis  Data  Firehose  retries
                 delivery  (including  the first attempt). After this time has
                 elapsed, the failed  documents  are  written  to  Amazon  S3.
                 Default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes). A value of 0 (zero)
                 results in no retries.

          S3BackupMode -> (string)
              Defines how documents should be delivered to Amazon S3. When  it
              is set to FailedDocumentsOnly , Kinesis Data Firehose writes any
              documents that could not be indexed to the configured Amazon  S3
              destination, with elasticsearch-failed/ appended to the key pre-
              fix. When set to AllDocuments , Kinesis Data  Firehose  delivers
              all  incoming records to Amazon S3, and also writes failed docu-
              ments with elasticsearch-failed/ appended  to  the  prefix.  For
              more  information, see Amazon S3 Backup for the Amazon ES Desti-
              nation . Default value is FailedDocumentsOnly .

                 Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that  Kinesis  Data Firehose evaluates and adds to
                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately  following the bucket name. For information about

                     Buffer incoming data to  the  specified  size,  in  MiBs,
                     before  delivering  it  to  the  destination. The default
                     value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify
                     a  value for it, you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than  the  amount  of  data you typically ingest into the
                     delivery stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you  typi-

                     for SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon Redshift destinations because they are  not  supported

                        Amazon S3 bucket. For  more  information,  see  Amazon
                        Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

              CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch logging options for your delivery stream.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)

                 (structure)
                     Describes a data processor.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of processor.

                     Parameters -> (list)
                        The processor parameters.

                        (structure)
                            Describes the processor parameter.

                            ParameterName -> (string)
                               The name of the parameter.

                            ParameterValue -> (string)
                               The parameter value.

          CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
              The  Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your delivery stream.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

              LogGroupName -> (string)
                 The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required
                 if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

              LogStreamName -> (string)
                 The  CloudWatch  log  stream  name for logging. This value is
                 required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          VpcConfiguration -> (structure)
              The details of the VPC of the Amazon ES destination.

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 The IDs of the subnets that you want Kinesis Data Firehose to
                 use  to  create ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon ES destination.
                 Make sure that the routing tables and  inbound  and  outbound
                 rules  allow  traffic  to flow from the subnets whose IDs are
                 specified here to the subnets that have the destination  Ama-
                 zon  ES endpoints. Kinesis Data Firehose creates at least one
                 ENI in each of the subnets that are specified  here.  Do  not
                 delete or modify these ENIs.

                 The  number of ENIs that Kinesis Data Firehose creates in the
                 subnets specified here scales up and down automatically based
                 on  throughput.  To  enable Kinesis Data Firehose to scale up
                 the number of ENIs to match throughput, ensure that you  have
                 sufficient  quota.  To help you calculate the quota you need,
                 assume that Kinesis Data Firehose can create up to three ENIs
                 for  this  delivery  stream for each of the subnets specified
                 here. For more  information  about  ENI  quota,  see  Network
                 Interfaces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.

                 (string)

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the IAM role that you want the delivery stream to
                 use to create endpoints in the destination VPC. You  can  use
                 your  existing Kinesis Data Firehose delivery role or you can
                 specify a new role. In either case, make sure that  the  role
                 trusts  the  Kinesis Data Firehose service principal and that
                 it grants the following permissions:

                 o ec2:DescribeVpcs

                 o ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute

                 o ec2:DescribeSubnets

                 o ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

                 o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

                 o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

                 o ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission

                 o ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

                 If you revoke these permissions after you create the delivery
                 stream,  Kinesis  Data  Firehose  can't scale out by creating
                 more ENIs when necessary. You might therefore see a  degrada-
                 tion in performance.

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The  IDs  of  the  security groups that you want Kinesis Data
                 Firehose to use when it creates ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon
                 ES  destination. You can use the same security group that the
                 Amazon ES domain uses or different ones. If you specify  dif-
                 ferent  security groups here, ensure that they allow outbound
                 HTTPS traffic to the Amazon ES domain's security group.  Also
                 ensure  that  the  Amazon  ES  domain's security group allows
                 HTTPS traffic from the security groups specified here. If you
                 use the same security group for both your delivery stream and
                 the Amazon ES domain, make sure the  security  group  inbound
                 rule  allows  HTTPS traffic. For more information about secu-
                 rity group rules, see Security group rules in the Amazon  VPC
                 documentation.

                 The ARN of the S3 bucket. For more  information,  see  Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The  "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically used
                 for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a  custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A prefix that Kinesis Data Firehose  evaluates  and  adds  to
                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately following the bucket name. For information  about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The buffering option. If no value is  specified,  BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                     Buffer  incoming  data  to  the  specified size, in MiBs,
                     before delivering it  to  the  destination.  The  default
                     value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify
                     a value for it, you must also specify a value for  Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We  recommend  setting  this parameter to a value greater
                     than the amount of data you  typically  ingest  into  the
                     delivery  stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typi-
                     cally ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value  should  be  10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it  to  the  destination.  The
                     default  value  is 300. This parameter is optional but if
                     you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value
                     for SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon  Redshift  destinations because they are not supported
                 by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the  S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  encryption  configuration. If no value is specified, the
                 default is no encryption.

                 The ARN of the IAM role that you want the delivery stream  to
                 use  to  create endpoints in the destination VPC. You can use
                 your existing Kinesis Data Firehose delivery role or you  can
                 specify  a  new role. In either case, make sure that the role
                 trusts the Kinesis Data Firehose service principal  and  that
                 it grants the following permissions:

                 o ec2:DescribeVpcs

                 o ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute

                 o ec2:DescribeSubnets

                 o ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

                 o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

                 o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

                 o ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission

                 o ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

                 If you revoke these permissions after you create the delivery
                 stream, Kinesis Data Firehose can't  scale  out  by  creating
                 more  ENIs when necessary. You might therefore see a degrada-
                 tion in performance.

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The IDs of the security groups that  you  want  Kinesis  Data
                 Firehose to use when it creates ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon
                 ES destination. You can use the same security group that  the
                 Amazon  ES domain uses or different ones. If you specify dif-
                 ferent security groups here, ensure that they allow  outbound
                 HTTPS  traffic to the Amazon ES domain's security group. Also
                 ensure that the Amazon  ES  domain's  security  group  allows
                 HTTPS traffic from the security groups specified here. If you
                 use the same security group for both your delivery stream and
                 the  Amazon  ES  domain, make sure the security group inbound
                 rule allows HTTPS traffic. For more information  about  secu-
                 rity  group rules, see Security group rules in the Amazon VPC
                 documentation.

       --splunk-destination-configuration (structure)
          The destination in Splunk. You can specify only one destination.

          HECEndpoint -> (string)
              The HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint to  which  Kinesis  Data
              Firehose sends your data.

          HECEndpointType -> (string)
              This type can be either "Raw" or "Event."

          HECToken -> (string)
              This is a GUID that you obtain from your Splunk cluster when you
              create a new HEC endpoint.

          HECAcknowledgmentTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              The amount of time that Kinesis Data Firehose waits  to  receive
              an acknowledgment from Splunk after it sends it data. At the end
              of the timeout period, Kinesis Data  Firehose  either  tries  to
              send  the  data  again  or  considers it an error, based on your
              retry settings.

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              The retry behavior in case Kinesis Data Firehose  is  unable  to
              deliver  data to Splunk, or if it doesn't receive an acknowledg-
              ment of receipt from Splunk.

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The total amount of time that Kinesis Data Firehose spends on
                 retries.  This  duration  starts after the initial attempt to
                 send data to Splunk fails. It  doesn't  include  the  periods
                 during  which  Kinesis Data Firehose waits for acknowledgment
                 from Splunk after each attempt.

          S3BackupMode -> (string)
              Defines how documents should be delivered to Amazon S3. When set
              to FailedEventsOnly , Kinesis Data Firehose writes any data that
              could not be indexed to the configured  Amazon  S3  destination.
              When  set  to  AllEvents  ,  Kinesis  Data Firehose delivers all
              incoming records to Amazon S3, and also writes failed  documents
              to Amazon S3. The default value is FailedEventsOnly .

              You  can  update  this  backup  mode  from  FailedEventsOnly  to
              AllEvents . You can't  update  it  from  AllEvents  to  FailedE-
              ventsOnly .

          S3Configuration -> (structure)
              The configuration for the backup Amazon S3 location.

              RoleARN -> (string)

                 more information, see Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)  and  AWS
                 Service Namespaces .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information, see Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that  Kinesis  Data Firehose evaluates and adds to
                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately  following the bucket name. For information about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data to  the  specified  size,  in  MiBs,
                     before  delivering  it  to  the  destination. The default
                     value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify
                     a  value for it, you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than  the  amount  of  data you typically ingest into the
                     delivery stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds,  before  delivering  it  to the destination. The
                     default value is 300. This parameter is optional  but  if
                     you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value
                     for SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon Redshift destinations because they are  not  supported
                 by  the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration. If no value is  specified,  the
                 default is no encryption.

                 NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                     Specifically  override existing encryption information to
                     ensure that no encryption is used.

                 KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                     The encryption key.

                     AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)

       --http-endpoint-destination-configuration (structure)
          Enables configuring Kinesis Firehose to deliver  data  to  any  HTTP
          endpoint destination. You can specify only one destination.

          EndpointConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  configuration of the HTTP endpoint selected as the destina-
              tion.

              Url -> (string)
                 The URL of the HTTP endpoint selected as the destination.

                 WARNING:
                     If you choose  an  HTTP  endpoint  as  your  destination,
                     review and follow the instructions in the Appendix - HTTP
                     Endpoint Delivery Request and Response Specifications .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the HTTP endpoint selected as the destination.

              AccessKey -> (string)
                 The access key required for Kinesis Firehose to  authenticate
                 with the HTTP endpoint selected as the destination.

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The  buffering options that can be used before data is delivered
              to the specified destination. Kinesis Data Firehose treats these
              options  as  hints, and it might choose to use more optimal val-
              ues.  The  SizeInMBs  and   IntervalInSeconds   parameters   are
              optional.  However,  if you specify a value for one of them, you
              must also provide a value for the other.

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data to the specified size,  in  MBs,  before
                 delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5.

                 We  recommend  setting this parameter to a value greater than
                 the amount of data you typically  ingest  into  the  delivery

                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately following the bucket name. For information  about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The buffering option. If no value is  specified,  BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer  incoming  data  to  the  specified size, in MiBs,
                     before delivering it  to  the  destination.  The  default
                     value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify
                     a value for it, you must also specify a value for  Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We  recommend  setting  this parameter to a value greater
                     than the amount of data you  typically  ingest  into  the
                     delivery  stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typi-
                     cally ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value  should  be  10
                     MiB or higher.

                     seconds, before delivering it  to  the  destination.  The
                     default  value  is 300. This parameter is optional but if
                     you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value
                     for SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon  Redshift  destinations because they are not supported
                 by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the  S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  encryption  configuration. If no value is specified, the

       --tags (list)
          A set of tags to assign to the delivery stream. A tag is a key-value
          pair that you can define and assign to AWS resources. Tags are meta-
          data. For example, you can add friendly names  and  descriptions  or
          other  types of information that can help you distinguish the deliv-
          ery stream. For more information about tags, see Using Cost  Alloca-
          tion Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.

          You can specify up to 50 tags when creating a delivery stream.

          (structure)
              Metadata that you can assign to a delivery stream, consisting of
              a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the tag. Maximum length: 128  charac-
                 ters. Valid characters: Unicode letters, digits, white space,
                 _ . / = + - % @

              Value -> (string)
                 An optional string, which you can use to describe  or  define
                 the  tag.  Maximum  length: 256 characters. Valid characters:

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DeliveryStreamARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the delivery stream.
