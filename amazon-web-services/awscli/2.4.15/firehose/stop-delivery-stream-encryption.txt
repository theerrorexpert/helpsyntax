STOP-DELIVERY-STREAM-ENCRYPTION()            STOP-DELIVERY-STREAM-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       stop-delivery-stream-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables server-side encryption (SSE) for the delivery stream.

       This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke
       it, Kinesis Data Firehose first  sets  the  encryption  status  of  the
       stream  to  DISABLING , and then to DISABLED . You can continue to read
       and write data to your stream while its status is DISABLING  .  It  can
       take  up  to  5 seconds after the encryption status changes to DISABLED
       before all records written to the delivery stream are no longer subject
       to  encryption.  To find out whether a record or a batch of records was
       encrypted, check the response elements   PutRecordOutput$Encrypted  and
       PutRecordBatchOutput$Encrypted , respectively.

       To check the encryption state of a delivery stream, use  DescribeDeliv-
       eryStream .

       If SSE is enabled using a customer managed  CMK  and  then  you  invoke
       StopDeliveryStreamEncryption  ,  Kinesis  Data  Firehose  schedules the
       related KMS grant for retirement and then retires it after  it  ensures
       that it is finished delivering records to the destination.

       The   StartDeliveryStreamEncryption   and  StopDeliveryStreamEncryption
       operations have a combined limit of 25 calls per delivery stream per 24
       hours. For example, you reach the limit if you call StartDeliveryStrea-
       mEncryption 13 times and StopDeliveryStreamEncryption 12 times for  the
       same delivery stream in a 24-hour period.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-delivery-stream-encryption
          --delivery-stream-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  delivery  stream  for  which you want to disable
          server-side encryption (SSE).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
