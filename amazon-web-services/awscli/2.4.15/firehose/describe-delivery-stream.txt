DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-STREAM()                          DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-STREAM()



NAME
       describe-delivery-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  specified  delivery stream and its status. For example,
       after your delivery stream is created, call  DescribeDeliveryStream  to
       see  whether the delivery stream is ACTIVE and therefore ready for data
       to be sent to it.

       If the status of a delivery stream is  CREATING_FAILED  ,  this  status
       doesn't change, and you can't invoke  CreateDeliveryStream again on it.
       However, you can invoke the  DeleteDeliveryStream operation  to  delete
       it. If the status is DELETING_FAILED , you can force deletion by invok-
       ing   DeleteDeliveryStream  again  but  with    DeleteDeliveryStreamIn-
       put$AllowForceDelete set to true.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-delivery-stream
          --delivery-stream-name <value>
          [--limit <value>]
          [--exclusive-start-destination-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The name of the delivery stream.

       --limit (integer)
          The  limit on the number of destinations to return. You can have one
          destination per delivery stream.

       --exclusive-start-destination-id (string)
          The ID of the destination to start returning the destination  infor-
          mation.  Kinesis Data Firehose supports one destination per delivery
          stream.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DeliveryStreamDescription -> (structure)
          Information about the delivery stream.

          DeliveryStreamName -> (string)
              The name of the delivery stream.

          DeliveryStreamARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the delivery stream. For  more
              information,  see  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service
              Namespaces .

          DeliveryStreamStatus -> (string)
              The status of the delivery stream. If the status of  a  delivery
              stream  is CREATING_FAILED , this status doesn't change, and you
              can't invoke CreateDeliveryStream again on it. However, you  can
              invoke the  DeleteDeliveryStream operation to delete it.

          FailureDescription -> (structure)
              Provides  details  in case one of the following operations fails
              due to an error related to KMS:  CreateDeliveryStream ,   Delet-
              eDeliveryStream  ,   StartDeliveryStreamEncryption ,  StopDeliv-
              eryStreamEncryption .

              Indicates the server-side encryption (SSE) status for the deliv-
              ery stream.

              KeyARN -> (string)
                 If KeyType is CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK , this field contains  the
                 ARN  of the customer managed CMK. If KeyType is AWS_OWNED_CMK
                 ,  DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfiguration  doesn't  contain  a
                 value for KeyARN .

              KeyType -> (string)
                 Indicates  the type of customer master key (CMK) that is used
                 for encryption. The default setting is  AWS_OWNED_CMK  .  For
                 more  information about CMKs, see Customer Master Keys (CMKs)
                 .

              Status -> (string)
                 This is the  server-side  encryption  (SSE)  status  for  the
                 delivery stream. For a full description of the different val-
                 ues of this status,  see   StartDeliveryStreamEncryption  and
                 StopDeliveryStreamEncryption    .    If    this   status   is
                 ENABLING_FAILED or DISABLING_FAILED , it is the status of the
                 most recent attempt to enable or disable SSE, respectively.

              FailureDescription -> (structure)
                 Provides  details  in  case  one  of the following operations
                 fails due to an error related to KMS:  CreateDeliveryStream ,
                 DeleteDeliveryStream   ,    StartDeliveryStreamEncryption   ,

                data stream as a source.

          VersionId -> (string)
              Each time the destination is updated for a delivery stream,  the
              version  ID  is  changed, and the current version ID is required
              when updating the destination. This is so that the service knows
              it  is applying the changes to the correct version of the deliv-
              ery stream.

          CreateTimestamp -> (timestamp)

                               The default  value  is  5.  This  parameter  is
                               optional but if you specify a value for it, you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We  recommend setting this parameter to a value
                               greater than the amount of data  you  typically
                               ingest  into the delivery stream in 10 seconds.
                               For example, if you typically ingest data at  1
                               MiB/sec,  the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                               Buffer incoming data for the  specified  period

                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter  is  optional  but  if  you specify a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)
                            The  compression format. If no value is specified,
                            the default is UNCOMPRESSED .

                        EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The encryption configuration. If no value is spec-
                            ified, the default is no encryption.

                            NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                               Specifically   override   existing   encryption
                               information to ensure  that  no  encryption  is
                               used.

                            KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                               The encryption key.

                               The CloudWatch group  name  for  logging.  This
                               value  is  required  if  CloudWatch  logging is
                               enabled.

                            LogStreamName -> (string)
                               The CloudWatch log  stream  name  for  logging.
                               This value is required if CloudWatch logging is

                            contains the column information. This parameter is
                            required if Enabled is set to true.

                            RoleARN -> (string)
                               The role that Kinesis Data Firehose can use  to
                               access  AWS Glue. This role must be in the same
                               account you  use  for  Kinesis  Data  Firehose.
                               Cross-account roles aren't allowed.

                               If you don't specify an AWS Region, the default
                               is the current Region.

                            VersionId -> (string)
                               Specifies the table version for the output data
                               schema. If you don't specify this  version  ID,
                               or if you set it to LATEST , Kinesis Data Fire-
                               hose uses the most recent version.  This  means
                               that any updates to the table are automatically
                               picked up.

                        InputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                            Specifies the deserializer that you  want  Kinesis
                            Data Firehose to use to convert the format of your
                            data from JSON.  This  parameter  is  required  if
                            Enabled is set to true.

                            Deserializer -> (structure)
                               Specifies  which  deserializer  to use. You can
                               choose either the Apache Hive JSON SerDe or the
                               OpenX  JSON  SerDe.  If  both are non-null, the
                               server rejects the request.

                               OpenXJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                                   The OpenX SerDe. Used by Kinesis Data Fire-
                                   hose  for  deserializing  data, which means
                                   converting  it  from  the  JSON  format  in
                                   preparation  for serializing it to the Par-
                                   quet or ORC format.  This  is  one  of  two
                                   deserializers  you can choose, depending on
                                   which  one  offers  the  functionality  you
                                   need. The other option is the native Hive /
                                   HCatalog JsonSerDe.

                                   ConvertDotsInJsonKeysToUnderscores       ->
                                   (boolean)
                                      When  set  to  true , specifies that the
                                      names of the keys include dots and  that
                                      you   want   Kinesis  Data  Firehose  to
                                      replace them with underscores.  This  is
                                      useful  because  Apache  Hive  does  not
                                      allow dots in column names. For example,
                                      if the JSON contains a key whose name is
                                      "a.b", you can define the column name to
                                      be "a_b" when using this option.

                                      The default is false .

                                   CaseInsensitive -> (boolean)
                                      When set to true , which is the default,
                                      Kinesis Data Firehose converts JSON keys
                                      to  lowercase before deserializing them.

                                   ColumnToJsonKeyMappings -> (map)
                                      Maps column  names  to  JSON  keys  that
                                      aren't  identical  to  the column names.
                                      This is useful when  the  JSON  contains
                                      keys  that  are Hive keywords. For exam-
                                      ple, timestamp is a Hive keyword. If you
                                      have  a  JSON  key named timestamp , set
                                      this parameter to {"ts": "timestamp"} to
                                      map this key to a column named ts .

                               HiveJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                                   The  native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. Used
                                   by Kinesis Data Firehose for  deserializing
                                   data,  which  means  converting it from the
                                   JSON format in preparation for  serializing
                                   it  to  the  Parquet or ORC format. This is
                                   one of two deserializers  you  can  choose,
                                   depending on which one offers the function-
                                   ality you need. The  other  option  is  the
                                   OpenX SerDe.

                                   TimestampFormats -> (list)

                                      Firehose to parse  the  date  and  time-
                                      stamps that may be present in your input
                                      data  JSON.  To  specify  these   format
                                      strings,  follow  the  pattern syntax of
                                      JodaTime's     DateTimeFormat     format
                                      strings. For more information, see Class
                                      DateTimeFormat . You can  also  use  the
                                      special value millis to parse timestamps
                                      in  epoch  milliseconds.  If  you  don't
                                      specify  a format, Kinesis Data Firehose
                                      uses   java.sql.Timestamp::valueOf    by
                                      default.

                                      (string)

                                      divided  into pages. A page is conceptu-
                                      ally an indivisible unit  (in  terms  of
                                      compression  and  encoding). The minimum
                                      value is 64 KiB and  the  default  is  1
                                      MiB.

                                   EnablePadding -> (boolean)
                                      Set this to true to  indicate  that  you
                                      want  stripes  to  be padded to the HDFS
                                      block boundaries. This is useful if  you
                                      intend  to  copy the data from Amazon S3
                                      to HDFS before querying. The default  is

                                   PaddingTolerance -> (double)
                                      A  number  between  0 and 1 that defines
                                      the tolerance for  block  padding  as  a
                                      decimal  fraction  of  stripe  size. The
                                      default value is  0.05,  which  means  5
                                      percent of stripe size.

                                      For  the  default  values  of 64 MiB ORC
                                      stripes and 256  MiB  HDFS  blocks,  the
                                      default  block  padding  tolerance  of 5
                                      percent reserves a maximum  of  3.2  MiB
                                      for padding within the 256 MiB block. In
                                      such  a  case,  if  the  available  size
                                      within the block is more than 3.2 MiB, a
                                      new, smaller stripe is inserted  to  fit
                                      within  that space. This ensures that no
                                      stripe  crosses  block  boundaries   and
                                      causes  remote reads within a node-local
                                      task.

                                      Kinesis  Data  Firehose   ignores   this

                                      value is 0.05, the minimum is 0, and the
                                      maximum is 1.

                                      Represents the  fraction  of  the  total
                                      number  of  non-null  rows.  To turn off
                                      dictionary encoding, set  this  fraction
                                      to a number that is less than the number
                                      of distinct keys  in  a  dictionary.  To
                                      always use dictionary encoding, set this
                                      threshold to 1.

                               The  default  value  is  5.  This  parameter is
                               optional but if you specify a value for it, you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We recommend setting this parameter to a  value
                               greater  than  the amount of data you typically
                               ingest into the delivery stream in 10  seconds.
                               For  example, if you typically ingest data at 1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or  higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                               Buffer  incoming  data for the specified period

                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter is optional  but  if  you  specify  a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                            destination. Make sure that the routing tables and
                            inbound  and  outbound rules allow traffic to flow
                            from the subnets whose IDs are specified  here  to
                            the  subnets  that  have the destination Amazon ES
                            endpoints. Kinesis Data Firehose creates at  least
                            one  ENI in each of the subnets that are specified
                            here. Do not delete or modify these ENIs.

                            The number of ENIs that Kinesis Data Firehose cre-
                            ates  in  the subnets specified here scales up and
                            down automatically based on throughput. To  enable
                            Kinesis  Data  Firehose  to scale up the number of
                            ENIs to match throughput,  ensure  that  you  have
                            sufficient  quota. To help you calculate the quota
                            you need, assume that Kinesis  Data  Firehose  can
                            create  up  to three ENIs for this delivery stream
                            for each of the subnets specified here.  For  more
                            information  about  ENI  quota, see Network Inter-
                            faces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.

                            You can use your existing  Kinesis  Data  Firehose
                            delivery  role  or  you can specify a new role. In
                            either case, make sure that the  role  trusts  the
                            Kinesis  Data  Firehose service principal and that
                            it grants the following permissions:

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcs

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute

                            o ec2:DescribeSubnets

                            o ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

                            o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission

                            o ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

                            If you revoke these permissions after  you  create
                            the  delivery  stream, Kinesis Data Firehose can't
                            scale out by creating more  ENIs  when  necessary.
                            You  might  therefore see a degradation in perfor-
                            mance.

                        SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups that  Kinesis  Data
                            Firehose  uses  when it creates ENIs in the VPC of
                            the Amazon ES destination. You can  use  the  same
                            security  group  that the Amazon ES domain uses or
                            different ones. If you specify different  security
                            groups,  ensure  that  they  allow  outbound HTTPS
                            traffic to the Amazon ES domain's security  group.
                            Also  ensure  that the Amazon ES domain's security
                            group  allows  HTTPS  traffic  from  the  security
                            groups  specified  here. If you use the same secu-
                            rity group for both your delivery stream  and  the
                            Amazon  ES  domain,  make  sure the security group
                            inbound rule allows HTTPS traffic. For more infor-
                            mation  about  security  group rules, see Security
                            group rules in the Amazon VPC documentation.

                     S3DestinationDescription -> (structure)
                        Describes a destination in Amazon S3.

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  creden-
                            tials.  For  more information, see Amazon Resource
                            Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

                        BucketARN -> (string)
                            The ARN of the S3 bucket.  For  more  information,
                            see  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service
                            Namespaces .

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automat-
                            ically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can
                            also specify a  custom  prefix,  as  described  in
                            Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

                        ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                            A  prefix that Kinesis Data Firehose evaluates and
                            adds to failed records before writing them to  S3.
                            This  prefix  appears  immediately  following  the
                            bucket name. For information about how to  specify
                            this  prefix,  see  Custom  Prefixes for Amazon S3
                            Objects .

                        BufferingHints -> (structure)
                            The buffering option. If no  value  is  specified,
                            BufferingHints object default values are used.

                            SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                               Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in
                               MiBs, before delivering it to the  destination.
                               The  default  value  is  5.  This  parameter is
                               optional but if you specify a value for it, you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We recommend setting this parameter to a  value
                               greater  than  the amount of data you typically
                               ingest into the delivery stream in 10  seconds.
                               For  example, if you typically ingest data at 1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or  higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                               Buffer  incoming  data for the specified period
                               of time, in seconds, before  delivering  it  to
                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter is optional  but  if  you  specify  a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)
                            The compression format. If no value is  specified,
                            the default is UNCOMPRESSED .

                        EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The encryption configuration. If no value is spec-
                            ified, the default is no encryption.

                            NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                               Specifically   override   existing   encryption
                               information  to  ensure  that  no encryption is
                               used.

                            KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                               The encryption key.

                               AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   encryption key. Must belong to the same AWS
                                   Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket.
                                   For  more  information, see Amazon Resource
                                   Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

                        CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                            The Amazon CloudWatch  logging  options  for  your
                            delivery stream.

                            Enabled -> (boolean)
                               Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                            LogGroupName -> (string)
                               The  CloudWatch  group  name  for logging. This
                               value is  required  if  CloudWatch  logging  is
                               enabled.

                            LogStreamName -> (string)
                               The  CloudWatch  log  stream  name for logging.
                               This value is required if CloudWatch logging is
                               enabled.

                     ProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Describes a data processing configuration.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)

                        Processors -> (list)
                            The data processors.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a data processor.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   The type of processor.

                               Parameters -> (list)
                                   The processor parameters.

                                   (structure)
                                      Describes the processor parameter.

                                      ParameterName -> (string)
                                          The name of the parameter.

                                          The parameter value.

                     CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                        Describes  the  Amazon  CloudWatch logging options for
                        your delivery stream.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                        LogGroupName -> (string)
                            The CloudWatch group name for logging. This  value
                            is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

                        LogStreamName -> (string)
                            The  CloudWatch  log stream name for logging. This
                            value  is  required  if  CloudWatch   logging   is
                            enabled.

                     VpcConfigurationDescription -> (structure)
                        The details of the VPC of the Amazon ES destination.

                        SubnetIds -> (list)
                            The  IDs of the subnets that Kinesis Data Firehose
                            uses to create ENIs in the VPC of  the  Amazon  ES
                            destination. Make sure that the routing tables and
                            inbound and outbound rules allow traffic  to  flow
                            from  the  subnets whose IDs are specified here to
                            the subnets that have the  destination  Amazon  ES
                            endpoints.  Kinesis Data Firehose creates at least
                            one ENI in each of the subnets that are  specified
                            here. Do not delete or modify these ENIs.

                            The number of ENIs that Kinesis Data Firehose cre-
                            ates in the subnets specified here scales  up  and
                            down  automatically based on throughput. To enable
                            Kinesis Data Firehose to scale up  the  number  of
                            ENIs  to  match  throughput,  ensure that you have
                            sufficient quota. To help you calculate the  quota
                            you  need,  assume  that Kinesis Data Firehose can
                            create up to three ENIs for this  delivery  stream
                            for  each  of the subnets specified here. For more
                            information about ENI quota,  see  Network  Inter-
                            faces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.

                            (string)

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of the IAM role that the delivery stream
                            uses to create endpoints in the  destination  VPC.
                            You  can  use  your existing Kinesis Data Firehose
                            delivery role or you can specify a  new  role.  In
                            either  case,  make  sure that the role trusts the
                            Kinesis Data Firehose service principal  and  that
                            it grants the following permissions:

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcs

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute

                            o ec2:DescribeSubnets

                            o ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

                            o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission

                            o ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

                            If  you  revoke these permissions after you create
                            the delivery stream, Kinesis Data  Firehose  can't
                            scale  out  by  creating more ENIs when necessary.
                            You might therefore see a degradation  in  perfor-
                            mance.

                        SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                            The  IDs  of the security groups that Kinesis Data
                            Firehose uses when it creates ENIs in the  VPC  of
                            the  Amazon  ES  destination. You can use the same
                            security group that the Amazon ES domain  uses  or
                            different  ones. If you specify different security
                            groups, ensure  that  they  allow  outbound  HTTPS
                            traffic  to the Amazon ES domain's security group.
                            Also ensure that the Amazon ES  domain's  security
                            group  allows  HTTPS  traffic  from  the  security
                            groups specified here. If you use the  same  secu-

                               parameter  is  optional  but  if  you specify a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automat-
                            ically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can
                            also specify a  custom  prefix,  as  described  in
                            Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

                               Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in
                               MiBs, before delivering it to the  destination.
                               The  default  value  is  5.  This  parameter is
                               optional but if you specify a value for it, you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We recommend setting this parameter to a  value
                               greater  than  the amount of data you typically
                               ingest into the delivery stream in 10  seconds.
                               For  example, if you typically ingest data at 1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or  higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                               Buffer  incoming  data for the specified period
                               of time, in seconds, before  delivering  it  to
                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter is optional  but  if  you  specify  a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)
