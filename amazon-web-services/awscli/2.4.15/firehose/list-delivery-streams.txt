LIST-DELIVERY-STREAMS()                                LIST-DELIVERY-STREAMS()



NAME
       list-delivery-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your delivery streams in alphabetical order of their names.

       The  number  of  delivery  streams might be too large to return using a
       single call to ListDeliveryStreams . You can limit the number of deliv-
       ery  streams  returned, using the Limit parameter. To determine whether
       there are more delivery streams to list, check the value of  HasMoreDe-
       liveryStreams  in  the  output.  If  there are more delivery streams to
       list, you can request them by calling this operation again and  setting
       the  ExclusiveStartDeliveryStreamName parameter to the name of the last
       delivery stream returned in the last call.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-delivery-streams
          [--limit <value>]
          [--delivery-stream-type <value>]
          [--exclusive-start-delivery-stream-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of delivery streams to list. The default value is
          10.

       --delivery-stream-type (string)
          The delivery stream type. This can be one of the following values:

          o DirectPut  :  Provider  applications  access  the  delivery stream
            directly.

          o KinesisStreamAsSource : The delivery stream uses  a  Kinesis  data
            stream as a source.

          This  parameter  is optional. If this parameter is omitted, delivery
          streams of all types are returned.

          Possible values:

          o DirectPut

          o KinesisStreamAsSource

       --exclusive-start-delivery-stream-name (string)
          The list of delivery streams returned by this call to ListDeliveryS-
          treams  will  start with the delivery stream whose name comes alpha-
          betically immediately after the name you specify in  ExclusiveStart-
          DeliveryStreamName .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the available delivery streams

       The  following list-delivery-streams example lists the available deliv-
       ery streams in your AWS account.

          aws firehose list-delivery-streams

       Output:

          {
              "DeliveryStreamNames": [
                  "my-stream"
              ],
              "HasMoreDeliveryStreams": false
          }

       For more information, see Creating  an  Amazon  Kinesis  Data  Firehose
       Delivery Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       DeliveryStreamNames -> (list)
          The names of the delivery streams.

          (string)

       HasMoreDeliveryStreams -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether there are more delivery streams available to list.
