NAME
       put-registry-scanning-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  the  scanning configuration for your private reg-
       istry.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-registry-scanning-configuration
          [--scan-type <value>]
          [--rules <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scan-type (string)
          The scanning type to set for the registry.

          By default, the BASIC scan type is used. When basic scanning is set,
          you  may specify filters to determine which individual repositories,
          or all repositories, are scanned when new images are pushed.  Alter-
          natively, you can do manual scans of images with basic scanning.

          When  the ENHANCED scan type is set, Amazon Inspector provides auto-
          mated, continuous scanning of all repositories in your registry.

          Possible values:

          o BASIC

          o ENHANCED

       --rules (list)
          The scanning rules to use for the registry. A scanning rule is  used
          to determine which repository filters are used and at what frequency
          scanning will occur.

          (structure)
              The details of a scanning rule for a private registry.

              scanFrequency -> (string)
                 The frequency that scans are performed at for a private  reg-
                 istry.

              repositoryFilters -> (list)
                 The  repository filters associated with the scanning configu-
                 ration for a private registry.

                 (structure)
                     The details of a scanning repository filter.

                     filter -> (string)
                        The filter to use when scanning.

                     filterType -> (string)
                        The type associated with the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          scanFrequency=string,repositoryFilters=[{filter=string,filterType=string},{filter=string,filterType=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "scanFrequency": "SCAN_ON_PUSH"|"CONTINUOUS_SCAN"|"MANUAL",
              "repositoryFilters": [
                {
                  "filter": "string",
                  "filterType": "WILDCARD"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
