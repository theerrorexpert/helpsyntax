NAME
       describe-repositories -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes image repositories in a registry.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-repositories  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: repositories

SYNOPSIS
            describe-repositories
          [--registry-id <value>]
          [--repository-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains  the  repositories to be described. If you do not specify a
          registry, the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-names (list)
          A list of repositories to describe. If this  parameter  is  omitted,
          then all repositories in a registry are described.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the repositories in a registry

       This example describes the repositories in the default registry for  an
       account.

       Command:

          aws ecr describe-repositories

       Output:

          {
              "repositories": [
                  {
                      "registryId": "012345678910",
                      "repositoryName": "ubuntu",
                      "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:012345678910:repository/ubuntu"
                  },
                  {
                      "registryId": "012345678910",
                      "repositoryName": "test",
                      "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:012345678910:repository/test"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       repositories -> (list)
          A list of repository objects corresponding to valid repositories.

          (structure)
              An object representing a repository.

              repositoryArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that identifies the reposi-
                 tory. The ARN contains the arn:aws:ecr namespace, followed by
                 the  region of the repository, Amazon Web Services account ID
                 of the repository owner, repository namespace, and repository
                 name.  For  example,  arn:aws:ecr:region:012345678910:reposi-
                 tory/test .

              registryId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with  the  reg-
                 istry that contains the repository.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the repository.

              repositoryUri -> (string)
                 The  URI  for  the  repository. You can use this URI for con-
                 tainer image push and pull operations.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in JavaScript date format, when the repos-
                 itory was created.

              imageTagMutability -> (string)
                 The tag mutability setting for the repository.

              imageScanningConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The image scanning configuration for a repository.

                 scanOnPush -> (boolean)
                     The  setting  that  determines whether images are scanned
                     after being pushed to a repository.  If  set  to  true  ,
                     images will be scanned after being pushed. If this param-
                     eter is not specified,  it  will  default  to  false  and
                     images  will  not  be  scanned  unless a scan is manually
                     started with the API_StartImageScan API.

              encryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration for the repository. This  deter-
                 mines  how  the  contents of your repository are encrypted at
                 rest.

                 encryptionType -> (string)
                     The encryption type to use.

                     If you use the KMS encryption type, the contents  of  the
                     repository will be encrypted using server-side encryption
                     with Key Management Service key stored in KMS.  When  you
                     use  KMS  to  encrypt  your  data, you can either use the
                     default Amazon Web Services managed KMS  key  for  Amazon
                     ECR,  or specify your own KMS key, which you already cre-
                     ated. For more information,  see  Protecting  data  using
                     server-side encryption with an KMS key stored in Key Man-
                     agement Service (SSE-KMS) in the  Amazon  Simple  Storage
                     Service Console Developer Guide .

                     If  you  use  the AES256 encryption type, Amazon ECR uses
                     server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed  encryption
                     keys which encrypts the images in the repository using an
                     AES-256 encryption algorithm. For more  information,  see
                     Protecting  data using server-side encryption with Amazon
                     S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) in the Amazon  Simple
                     Storage Service Console Developer Guide .

                 kmsKey -> (string)
                     If  you  use the KMS encryption type, specify the KMS key
                     to use for encryption. The alias, key ID, or full ARN  of
                     the  KMS  key can be specified. The key must exist in the
                     same Region as the repository. If no  key  is  specified,
                     the  default Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for Ama-
                     zon ECR will be used.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to  include  in  a  future  DescribeRepositories
          request.  When  the results of a DescribeRepositories request exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve  the  next  page  of
          results.  This  value  is  null  when  there  are no more results to
          return.
