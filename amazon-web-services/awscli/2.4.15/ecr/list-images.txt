LIST-IMAGES()                                                    LIST-IMAGES()



NAME
       list-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all the image IDs for the specified repository.

       You  can filter images based on whether or not they are tagged by using
       the tagStatus filter and specifying either TAGGED , UNTAGGED or  ANY  .
       For example, you can filter your results to return only UNTAGGED images
       and then pipe that result to a  BatchDeleteImage  operation  to  delete
       them.  Or,  you can filter your results to return only TAGGED images to
       list all of the tags in your repository.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-images is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: imageIds

SYNOPSIS
            list-images
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the repository in which to list images. If you do not spec-
          ify a registry, the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The repository with image IDs to be listed.

       --filter (structure)
          The  filter  key  and  value  with  which  to filter your ListImages
          results.

          tagStatus -> (string)
              The tag status with which to filter  your   ListImages  results.
              You  can  filter  results  based  on  whether they are TAGGED or
              UNTAGGED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "tagStatus": "TAGGED"|"UNTAGGED"|"ANY"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the images in a repository

       The  following list-images example displays a list of the images in the
       cluster-autoscaler repository.

          aws ecr list-images \
              --repository-name cluster-autoscaler

       Output:

          {
              "imageIds": [
                  {
                      "imageDigest": "sha256:99c6fb4377e9a420a1eb3b410a951c9f464eff3b7dbc76c65e434e39b94b6570",
                      "imageTag": "v1.13.8"
                  },
                  {
                      "imageDigest": "sha256:99c6fb4377e9a420a1eb3b410a951c9f464eff3b7dbc76c65e434e39b94b6570",
                      "imageTag": "v1.13.7"
                  },
                  {
                      "imageDigest": "sha256:4a1c6567c38904384ebc64e35b7eeddd8451110c299e3368d2210066487d97e5",
                      "imageTag": "v1.13.6"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       imageIds -> (list)
          The list of image IDs for the requested repository.

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an image in an Amazon
              ECR repository.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag used for the image.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken value to include in a future ListImages request. When
          the results of a ListImages request exceed maxResults ,  this  value
          can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is null
          when there are no more results to return.
