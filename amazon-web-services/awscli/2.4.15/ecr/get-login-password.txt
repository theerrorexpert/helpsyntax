GET-LOGIN-PASSWORD()                                      GET-LOGIN-PASSWORD()



NAME
       get-login-password -

DESCRIPTION
       To log in to an Amazon ECR registry

       This  command  retrieves and displays an authentication token using the
       GetAuthorizationToken API that you can use to authenticate to an Amazon
       ECR registry. You can pass the authorization token to the login command
       of the container client of your preference, such  as  the  Docker  CLI.
       After  you  have authenticated to an Amazon ECR registry with this com-
       mand, you can use the client to push and pull images from that registry
       as  long  as  your  IAM  principal  has access to do so until the token
       expires. The authorization token is valid for 12 hours.

       This command is supported using the latest version of AWS CLI version 2
       or in v1.17.10 or later of AWS CLI version 1. For information on updat-
       ing to the latest AWS CLI version, see Installing the AWS  CLI  in  the
       AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a password to authenticate to a registry

       The  following  get-login-password displays a password that you can use
       with a container client of your choice to authenticate  to  any  Amazon
       ECR registry that your IAM principal has access to.

          aws ecr get-login-password

       Output:

          <password>

       To  use  with the Docker CLI, pipe the output of the get-login-password
       command to the docker login  command.  When  retrieving  the  password,
       ensure  that  you specify the same Region that your Amazon ECR registry
       exists in.

          aws ecr get-login-password \
              --region <region> \
          | docker login \
              --username AWS \
              --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
