DELETE-REPOSITORY()                                        DELETE-REPOSITORY()



NAME
       delete-repository -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  repository.  If  the  repository  contains images, you must
       either delete all images in the repository or use the force  option  to
       delete the repository.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-repository
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the repository to delete. If you do not specify a registry,
          the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository to delete.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          If a repository contains images, forces the deletion.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a repository

       The following delete-repository example command force deletes the spec-
       ified repository in the default registry for an  account.  The  --force
       flag is required if the repository contains images.

          aws ecr delete-repository \
              --repository-name ubuntu \
              --force

       Output:

          {
              "repository": {
                  "registryId": "123456789012",
                  "repositoryName": "ubuntu",
                  "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:123456789012:repository/ubuntu"
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       repository -> (structure)
          The repository that was deleted.

          repositoryArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies  the  repository.
              The  ARN  contains  the  arn:aws:ecr  namespace, followed by the
              region of the repository, Amazon Web Services account ID of  the
              repository owner, repository namespace, and repository name. For
              example, arn:aws:ecr:region:012345678910:repository/test .

          registryId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the  registry
              that contains the repository.

          repositoryName -> (string)
              The name of the repository.

          repositoryUri -> (string)
              The  URI  for the repository. You can use this URI for container
              image push and pull operations.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in JavaScript date format, when  the  reposi-
              tory was created.

          imageTagMutability -> (string)
              The tag mutability setting for the repository.

          imageScanningConfiguration -> (structure)
              The image scanning configuration for a repository.

              scanOnPush -> (boolean)
                 The  setting that determines whether images are scanned after
                 being pushed to a repository. If set to true , images will be
                 scanned  after  being pushed. If this parameter is not speci-
                 fied, it will default to false and images will not be scanned
                 unless a scan is manually started with the API_StartImageScan
                 API.

          encryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The encryption configuration for the repository. This determines
              how the contents of your repository are encrypted at rest.

              encryptionType -> (string)
                 The encryption type to use.

                 If  you  use  the  KMS  encryption  type, the contents of the
                 repository will be  encrypted  using  server-side  encryption
                 with  Key  Management Service key stored in KMS. When you use
                 KMS to encrypt your data, you can either use the default Ama-
                 zon  Web  Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR, or specify
                 your own KMS key, which you already created. For more  infor-
                 mation, see Protecting data using server-side encryption with
                 an KMS key stored in Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) in  the
                 Amazon Simple Storage Service Console Developer Guide .

                 If  you  use  the  AES256  encryption  type,  Amazon ECR uses
                 server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys
                 which  encrypts the images in the repository using an AES-256
                 encryption algorithm. For more  information,  see  Protecting
                 data  using  server-side  encryption  with  Amazon S3-managed
                 encryption keys (SSE-S3) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service
                 Console Developer Guide .

              kmsKey -> (string)
                 If  you  use  the KMS encryption type, specify the KMS key to
                 use for encryption. The alias, key ID, or full ARN of the KMS
                 key  can  be specified. The key must exist in the same Region
                 as the repository. If no key is specified, the default Amazon
                 Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR will be used.
