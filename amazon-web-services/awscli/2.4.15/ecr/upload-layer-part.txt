UPLOAD-LAYER-PART()                                        UPLOAD-LAYER-PART()



NAME
       upload-layer-part -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads an image layer part to Amazon ECR.

       When an image is pushed, each new image layer is uploaded in parts. The
       maximum size of each image layer part can be 20971520 bytes  (or  about
       20MB).  The UploadLayerPart API is called once per each new image layer
       part.

       NOTE:
          This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not  generally
          used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you
          should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            upload-layer-part
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --upload-id <value>
          --part-first-byte <value>
          --part-last-byte <value>
          --layer-part-blob <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the  registry  to
          which  you  are  uploading layer parts. If you do not specify a reg-
          istry, the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository to which you are uploading layer parts.

       --upload-id (string)
          The upload ID from a previous  InitiateLayerUpload operation to  as-
          sociate with the layer part upload.

       --part-first-byte (long)
          The  position  of the first byte of the layer part witin the overall
          image layer.

       --part-last-byte (long)
          The position of the last byte of the layer part within  the  overall
          image layer.

       --layer-part-blob (blob)
          The base64-encoded layer part payload.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To upload a layer part

       This  following  upload-layer-part  uploads  an image layer part to the
       layer-test repository.

              --part-first-byte 0 \
              --part-last-byte 8323314 \
              --layer-part-blob fileb:///var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/layerdb/sha256/ff986b10a018b48074e6d3a68b39aad8ccc002cdad912d4148c0f92b3729323e/layer.b64
