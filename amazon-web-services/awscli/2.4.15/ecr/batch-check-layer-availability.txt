BATCH-CHECK-LAYER-AVAILABILITY()              BATCH-CHECK-LAYER-AVAILABILITY()



NAME
       batch-check-layer-availability -

DESCRIPTION
       Checks the availability of one or more image layers in a repository.

       When an image is pushed to a repository, each image layer is checked to
       verify if it has been uploaded before. If it has  been  uploaded,  then
       the image layer is skipped.

       NOTE:
          This  operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally
          used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you
          should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-check-layer-availability
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --layer-digests <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the image layers to check. If you do  not  specify  a  reg-
          istry, the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The  name of the repository that is associated with the image layers
          to check.

       --layer-digests (list)
          The digests of the image layers to check.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To check the availability of a layer

       The following batch-check-layer-availability example checks the  avail-
       ability        of       a       layer       with       the       digest
       sha256:6171c7451a50945f8ddd72f7732cc04d7a0d1f48138a426b2e64387fdeb834ed
       in the cluster-autoscaler repository.

          aws ecr batch-check-layer-availability \
              --repository-name cluster-autoscaler \
              --layer-digests sha256:6171c7451a50945f8ddd72f7732cc04d7a0d1f48138a426b2e64387fdeb834ed

       Output:

          {
              "layers": [
                  {
                      "layerDigest": "sha256:6171c7451a50945f8ddd72f7732cc04d7a0d1f48138a426b2e64387fdeb834ed",
                      "layerAvailability": "AVAILABLE",
                      "layerSize": 2777,
                      "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.container.image.v1+json"
                  }
              ],
              "failures": []
          }

OUTPUT
       layers -> (list)
          A  list of image layer objects corresponding to the image layer ref-
          erences in the request.

          (structure)
              An object representing an Amazon ECR image layer.

              layerDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image layer.

              layerAvailability -> (string)
                 The availability status of the image layer.

              layerSize -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the image layer.

              mediaType -> (string)
                 The   media   type   of   the   layer,   such   as   applica-
                 tion/vnd.docker.image.rootfs.diff.tar.gzip     or    applica-
                 tion/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip .

       failures -> (list)
          Any failures associated with the call.

          (structure)

              layerDigest -> (string)
                 The layer digest associated with the failure.

              failureCode -> (string)
