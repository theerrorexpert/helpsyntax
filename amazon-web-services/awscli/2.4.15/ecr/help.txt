DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic  Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container
       image registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker  CLI,  or
       their  preferred  client,  to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR
       provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your  Docker  or
       Open  Container  Initiative  (OCI)  images. Amazon ECR supports private
       repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific
       users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images.

       Amazon  ECR  has  service  endpoints in each supported Region. For more
       information, see Amazon ECR endpoints in the Amazon Web  Services  Gen-
       eral Reference .
