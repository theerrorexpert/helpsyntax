DESCRIBE-IMAGES()                                            DESCRIBE-IMAGES()



NAME
       describe-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata about the images in a repository.

       NOTE:
          Beginning  with  Docker  version  1.9,  the Docker client compresses
          image layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry. The output
          of  the  docker images command shows the uncompressed image size, so
          it may return a larger image size than the image sizes  returned  by
          DescribeImages .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-images  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: imageDetails

          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          [--image-ids <value>]
          [--filter <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains  the  repository in which to describe images. If you do not
          specify a registry, the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The repository that contains the images to describe.

       --image-ids (list)
          The list of image IDs for the requested repository.

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an image in an Amazon
              ECR repository.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filter (structure)
          The  filter  key  and value with which to filter your DescribeImages
          results.

          tagStatus -> (string)
              The  tag  status  with  which  to  filter  your   DescribeImages
              results. You can filter results based on whether they are TAGGED
              or UNTAGGED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "tagStatus": "TAGGED"|"UNTAGGED"|"ANY"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The folowing describe-images example displays details about an image in
       the cluster-autoscaler repository with the tag v1.13.6.

          aws ecr describe-images \
              --repository-name cluster-autoscaler \

                 istry to which this image belongs.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the repository to which this image belongs.

              imageDigest -> (string)

              imageSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the image in the repository.

                 If the image is a manifest list, this will be the max size of
                 all manifests in the list.

                 NOTE:
                     Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client com-
                     presses image layers before pushing them to a  V2  Docker
                     registry.  The  output of the docker images command shows
                     the uncompressed image size, so it may  return  a  larger
                     image  size than the image sizes returned by  DescribeIm-
                     ages .

              imagePushedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, expressed in standard JavaScript date for-
                 mat, at which the current image was pushed to the repository.

              imageScanFindingsSummary -> (structure)
                 A summary of the last completed image scan.

                 imageScanCompletedAt -> (timestamp)

          value is null when there are no more results to return.
