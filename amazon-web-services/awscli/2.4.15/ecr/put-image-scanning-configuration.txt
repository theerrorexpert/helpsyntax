DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the image scanning configuration for the specified repository.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-image-scanning-configuration
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --image-scanning-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains  the  repository in which to update the image scanning con-
          figuration setting. If you do not specify a  registry,  the  default
          registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  repository in which to update the image scanning
          configuration setting.

       --image-scanning-configuration (structure)
          The image scanning configuration for the  repository.  This  setting
          determines  whether  images  are  scanned  for known vulnerabilities
          after being pushed to the repository.

          scanOnPush -> (boolean)
              The setting that determines whether  images  are  scanned  after
              being  pushed  to  a repository. If set to true , images will be
              scanned after being pushed. If this parameter is not  specified,
              it will default to false and images will not be scanned unless a
              scan is manually started with the API_StartImageScan API.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          scanOnPush=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "scanOnPush": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update the image scanning configuration for a repository

       The  following  put-image-scanning-configuration  example  updates  the
       image scanning configuration for the specified repository.

          aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration \
              --repository-name sample-repo \
              --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true

       Output:

          {
             "registryId": "012345678910",
             "repositoryName": "sample-repo",
             "imageScanningConfiguration": {
               "scanOnPush": true
             }
          }

OUTPUT
       registryId -> (string)
          The registry ID associated with the request.

       repositoryName -> (string)
          The repository name associated with the request.

       imageScanningConfiguration -> (structure)
          The image scanning configuration setting for the repository.

          scanOnPush -> (boolean)
              The setting that determines whether  images  are  scanned  after
              being  pushed  to  a repository. If set to true , images will be
              scanned after being pushed. If this parameter is not  specified,
