ASSOCIATE-RESOLVER-ENDPOINT-IP-ADDRESSASSOCIATE-RESOLVER-ENDPOINT-IP-ADDRESS()



NAME
       associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  IP  addresses  to an inbound or an outbound Resolver endpoint. If
       you want to add more than one IP address, submit  one  AssociateResolv-
       erEndpointIpAddress request for each IP address.

       To     remove     an    IP    address    from    an    endpoint,    see
       DisassociateResolverEndpointIpAddress .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address
          --resolver-endpoint-id <value>
          --ip-address <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver  endpoint  that  you  want  to  associate  IP
          addresses with.

       --ip-address (structure)
          Either  the IPv4 address that you want to add to a Resolver endpoint
          or a subnet ID. If you specify a subnet ID, Resolver chooses  an  IP
          address for you from the available IPs in the specified subnet.

          IpId -> (string)
              Only  when removing an IP address from a Resolver endpoint : The
              ID of the IP address that you want to remove. To  get  this  ID,
              use GetResolverEndpoint .

          SubnetId -> (string)
              The  ID of the subnet that includes the IP address that you want
              to update. To get this ID, use GetResolverEndpoint .

          Ip -> (string)
              The new IP address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IpId=string,SubnetId=string,Ip=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IpId": "string",
            "SubnetId": "string",
            "Ip": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate another IP address with a Resolver endpoint

       The following associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address example associates
       another  IP  address  with an inbound Resolver endpoint. If you specify
       only a subnet ID and omit the IP address from the --ip-address  parame-
       ter, Resolver chooses an IP address for you from among the available IP
       addresses in the specified subnet.

          aws route53resolver associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address \
              --resolver-endpoint-id rslvr-in-497098ad5example \
              --ip-address="SubnetId=subnet-12d8exam,Ip=192.0.2.118"

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverEndpoint": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-in-497098ad5example",

OUTPUT
       ResolverEndpoint -> (structure)
          The response to an AssociateResolverEndpointIpAddress request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A  unique  string  that  identifies the request that created the
              Resolver endpoint. The CreatorRequestId allows  failed  requests
              to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver endpoint.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  that  you  assigned to the Resolver endpoint when you
              submitted a CreateResolverEndpoint request.

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The ID of one or more security groups  that  control  access  to
              this  VPC.  The  security group must include one or more inbound
              rules (for inbound endpoints) or outbound  rules  (for  outbound
              endpoints).  Inbound  and  outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP
              access. For inbound access, open port 53. For  outbound  access,
              open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

              (string)

          Direction -> (string)
              Indicates whether the Resolver endpoint allows inbound  or  out-
              bound DNS queries:

              o INBOUND : allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network

              o OUTBOUND : allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network

          IpAddressCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  IP addresses that the Resolver endpoint can use
              for DNS queries.

          HostVPCId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC that you want to create the Resolver  endpoint
              in.

          Status -> (string)
              A  code  that  specifies the current status of the Resolver end-
              point. Valid values include the following:

              o CREATING : Resolver is creating and configuring  one  or  more
                Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.

              o OPERATIONAL  : The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this end-
                point are correctly configured and able  to  pass  inbound  or
                outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.

              o UPDATING  :  Resolver  is associating or disassociating one or
                more network interfaces with this endpoint.

              o AUTO_RECOVERING : Resolver is trying to recover one or more of
                the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint.
                During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with  lim-
                ited  capacity  because  of  the  limit  on  the number of DNS
                queries per IP address (per network interface). For  the  cur-
                rent limit, see Limits on Route 53 Resolver .

              o ACTION_NEEDED : This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't
                automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend
                that  you  check  each IP address that you associated with the
                endpoint. For  each  IP  address  that  isn't  available,  add
                another  IP  address and then delete the IP address that isn't
                available. (An endpoint must always include at  least  two  IP
                addresses.)  A  status  of ACTION_NEEDED can have a variety of
                causes. Here are two common causes:

                o One or more of the network interfaces  that  are  associated
                  with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.

                o The  network  interface  couldn't be created for some reason
                  that's outside the control of Resolver.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the  associ-
                ated network interfaces.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time that the endpoint was created, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the endpoint was last modified,  in  Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
