NAME
       create-firewall-domain-list -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  empty  firewall domain list for use in DNS Firewall rules.
       You can populate the domains for  the  new  list  with  a  file,  using
       ImportFirewallDomains  , or with domain strings, using  UpdateFirewall-
       Domains .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-firewall-domain-list
          [--creator-request-id <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and that allows  you  to
          retry  failed  requests  without  the  risk of running the operation
          twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique  string,  for  example,  a
          date/time stamp.

       --name (string)
          A  name that lets you identify the domain list to manage and use it.

       --tags (list)
          A list of the tag keys and values that you want  to  associate  with
          the domain list.

          (structure)
              One  tag  that  you want to add to the specified resource. A tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The name for the tag. For example, if you want  to  associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the tag. For example, if Key  is  account-id  ,
                 then  Value  might  be  the  ID  of the customer account that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall domain list

       The following create-firewall-domain-list example creates  a  Route  53
       Resolver DNS Firewall domain list, named test, in your AWS account.

          aws route53resolver create-firewall-domain-list \
              --creator-request-id my-request-id \
              --name test

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallDomainList": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-fdl-d61cbb2cbexample",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-domain-list/rslvr-fdl-d61cbb2cbexample",
                  "Name": "test",
                  "DomainCount": 0,
                  "Status": "COMPLETE",
                  "StatusMessage": "Created Firewall Domain List",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "my-request-id",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T15:55:51.115365Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T15:55:51.115365Z"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       FirewallDomainList -> (structure)
          The domain list that you just created.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the domain list.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall domain list.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the domain list.

          DomainCount -> (integer)
              The number of domain names that  are  specified  in  the  domain

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the domain list.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Additional  information  about the status of the list, if avail-
              able.

          ManagedOwnerName -> (string)
              The owner of the list, used only for lists that are not  managed
              by  you. For example, the managed domain list AWSManagedDomains-
              MalwareDomainList has the managed owner name Route  53  Resolver
              DNS Firewall .

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A  unique  string  defined  by you to identify the request. This
