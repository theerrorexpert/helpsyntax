PUT-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP-POLICY()              PUT-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP-POLICY()



NAME
       put-firewall-rule-group-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches  an  Identity  and Access Management (Amazon Web Services IAM)
       policy for sharing the rule group. You can use the policy to share  the
       rule group using Resource Access Manager (RAM).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-firewall-rule-group-policy
          --arn <value>
          --firewall-rule-group-policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The  ARN  (Amazon Resource Name) for the rule group that you want to
          share.

       --firewall-rule-group-policy (string)
          The Identity and Access Management (Amazon Web Services IAM)  policy
          to attach to the rule group.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
