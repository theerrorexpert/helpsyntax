LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP-ASSOCIATIONS()LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-firewall-rule-group-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  firewall rule group associations that you have defined.
       Each association enables DNS filtering for a VPC with one rule group.

       A single call might return only a partial list of the associations. For
       information, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewall-rule-group-associations  is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: FirewallRuleGroupAssociations

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewall-rule-group-associations
          [--firewall-rule-group-id <value>]
          [--vpc-id <value>]
          [--priority <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the firewall rule group that  you  want  to
          retrieve the associations for. Leave this blank to retrieve associa-
          tions for any rule group.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the VPC that you want to retrieve the asso-
          ciations for. Leave this blank to retrieve associations for any VPC.

       --priority (integer)
          The setting that determines the processing order of the  rule  group
          among  the  rule  groups  that are associated with a single VPC. DNS
          Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from the rule group  with  the
          lowest numeric priority setting.

       --status (string)
          The  association Status setting that you want DNS Firewall to filter
          on for the list. If  you  don't  specify  this,  then  DNS  Firewall
          returns all associations, regardless of status.

          Possible values:

          o COMPLETE

          o DELETING

          o UPDATING

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this
          token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of  objects,  pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       FirewallRuleGroupAssociations -> (list)
          A list of your firewall rule group associations.

          This  might  be  a  partial  list  of the associations that you have
          defined. For information, see MaxResults .

          (structure)
              An association between a firewall rule group and  a  VPC,  which
              enables DNS filtering for the VPC.

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier for the association.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the firewall rule group
                 association.

              FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the firewall rule group.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the VPC that is associated with  the
                 rule group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the association.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The  setting that determines the processing order of the rule
                 group among the rule groups that are associated with a single
                 VPC.  DNS  Firewall  filters  VPC  traffic starting from rule
                 group with the lowest numeric priority setting.

              MutationProtection -> (string)
                 If enabled, this setting disallows modification or removal of
                 the  association, to help prevent against accidentally alter-
                 ing DNS firewall protections.

              ManagedOwnerName -> (string)
                 The owner of the association, used only for associations that
                 are not managed by you. If you use Firewall Manager to manage
                 your DNS Firewalls, then this reports Firewall Manager as the
                 managed owner.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the association.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Additional  information  about the status of the response, if
                 available.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string defined by you to identify the request.  This
                 allows  you to retry failed requests without the risk of run-
                 ning the operation twice. This can be any unique string,  for
                 example, a timestamp.

              CreationTime -> (string)
                 The  date  and time that the association was created, in Unix
                 time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

              ModificationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the association was last modified,  in
                 Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
