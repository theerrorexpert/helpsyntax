NAME
       associate-resolver-query-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an Amazon VPC with a specified query logging configuration.
       Route 53 Resolver logs DNS queries that originate in all of the  Amazon
       VPCs  that are associated with a specified query logging configuration.
       To associate more than one VPC with a configuration, submit one Associ-
       ateResolverQueryLogConfig request for each VPC.

       NOTE:
          The  VPCs that you associate with a query logging configuration must
          be in the same Region as the configuration.

       To  remove  a   VPC   from   a   query   logging   configuration,   see
       DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-resolver-query-log-config
          --resolver-query-log-config-id <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-query-log-config-id (string)
          The ID of the query logging configuration that you want to associate
          a VPC with.

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of an Amazon VPC that you want this query logging  configura-
          tion to log queries for.

          NOTE:
              The VPCs and the query logging configuration must be in the same
              Region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociation -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains settings for  a  specified  association
          between an Amazon VPC and a query logging configuration.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the query logging association.

          ResolverQueryLogConfigId -> (string)
              The  ID of the query logging configuration that a VPC is associ-
              ated with.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon VPC that is associated with the query  log-
              ging configuration.

          Status -> (string)
              The  status  of  the  specified query logging association. Valid
              values include the following:

              o CREATING : Resolver is creating an association between an Ama-
                zon VPC and a query logging configuration.

              o CREATED  :  The  association between an Amazon VPC and a query
                logging configuration was successfully  created.  Resolver  is
                logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.

              o DELETING  :  Resolver  is deleting this query logging associa-
                tion.

              o FAILED : Resolver either couldn't create  or  couldn't  delete
                the query logging association.

          Error -> (string)
              If  the value of Status is FAILED , the value of Error indicates
              the cause:

              o DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND : The specified destination  (for  exam-
                ple, an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted.

              o ACCESS_DENIED  :  Permissions  don't allow sending logs to the
                destination.

              If the value of Status is a value other than FAILED ,  Error  is
              null.

          ErrorMessage -> (string)
              Contains additional information about the error. If the value or
              Error is null, the value of ErrorMessage also is null.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the VPC was  associated  with  the  query
              logging  configuration, in Unix time format and Coordinated Uni-
              versal Time (UTC).
