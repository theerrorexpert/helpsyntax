NAME
       delete-resolver-query-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a query logging configuration. When you delete a configuration,
       Resolver stops logging DNS queries for all of the Amazon VPCs that  are
       associated  with the configuration. This also applies if the query log-
       ging configuration is shared with other Amazon Web  Services  accounts,
       and  the other accounts have associated VPCs with the shared configura-
       tion.

       Before you can delete a query logging  configuration,  you  must  first
       disassociate     all     VPCs     from     the    configuration.    See
       DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig .

       If you used Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging con-
       figuration with other accounts, you must stop sharing the configuration
       before you can delete a configuration. The accounts that you shared the
       configuration  with  can  first  disassociate VPCs that they associated
       with the configuration, but that's not necessary. If you  stop  sharing
       the  configuration, those VPCs are automatically disassociated from the
       configuration.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-resolver-query-log-config
          --resolver-query-log-config-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-query-log-config-id (string)
          The ID of the query logging configuration that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResolverQueryLogConfig -> (structure)
          Information about the query logging configuration that you  deleted,
          including the status of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID for the query logging configuration.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that created
              the query logging configuration.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the specified query logging  configuration.  Valid
              values include the following:

              o CREATING  :  Resolver is creating the query logging configura-
                tion.

              o CREATED : The query  logging  configuration  was  successfully
                created.  Resolver  is  logging  queries that originate in the
                specified VPC.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging  configura-
                tion.

              o FAILED  :  Resolver can't deliver logs to the location that is
                specified in the query logging  configuration.  Here  are  two
                common causes:

                o The specified destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket)
                  was deleted.

                o Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              An indication of whether  the  query  logging  configuration  is
              shared  with  other  Amazon Web Services accounts, or was shared
              with the current account by another Amazon Web Services account.
              Sharing is configured through Resource Access Manager (RAM).

          AssociationCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  VPCs that are associated with the query logging
              configuration.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN for the query logging configuration.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the query logging configuration.

          DestinationArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource that you want  Resolver  to  send  query
              logs:  an  Amazon  S3  bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a
              Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies the  request  that  created  the
              query  logging configuration. The CreatorRequestId allows failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date and time that the query logging configuration was cre-
              ated, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC).
