LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()                              LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the tags that you associated with the specified resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tags-for-resource is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Tags

SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-for-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource  that  you  want  to
          list tags for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the tags for a Resolver resource

       The following list-tags-for-resource example lists the  tags  that  are
       assigned to the specified Resolver rule.

          aws route53resolver list-tags-for-resource \
              --resource-arn "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:111122223333:resolver-rule/rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example"

       Output:

          {
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "Key": "my-key-1",
                      "Value": "my-value-1"
                  },
                  {
                      "Key": "my-key-2",
                      "Value": "my-value-2"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          The tags that are associated with the resource that you specified in
          the ListTagsForResource request.

          (structure)
              One  tag  that  you want to add to the specified resource. A tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The name for the tag. For example, if you want  to  associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the tag. For example, if Key  is  account-id  ,
                 then  Value  might  be  the  ID  of the customer account that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If more than MaxResults tags match the specified criteria,  you  can
          submit  another ListTagsForResource request to get the next group of
          results. In the next request, specify the value  of  NextToken  from
          the previous response.
