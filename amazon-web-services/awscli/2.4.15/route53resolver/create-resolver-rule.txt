DESCRIPTION
       For  DNS  queries that originate in your VPCs, specifies which Resolver
       endpoint the queries pass through, one domain name  that  you  want  to
       forward  to  your network, and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers in
       your network.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-resolver-rule
          --creator-request-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          --rule-type <value>
          --domain-name <value>
          [--target-ips <value>]
          [--resolver-endpoint-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and that  allows  failed
          requests  to  be  retried  without the risk of running the operation
          twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique  string,  for  example,  a
          date/time stamp.

       --name (string)
          A  friendly  name  that  lets you easily find a rule in the Resolver
          dashboard in the Route 53 console.

       --rule-type (string)
          When you want to forward DNS queries for specified  domain  name  to
          resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD .

          When  you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a domain
          to your network and you want Resolver to process queries for a  sub-
          domain of that domain, specify SYSTEM .

          For  example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers on
          your network, you create a rule and specify FORWARD for  RuleType  .
          To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you cre-
          ate a rule and specify SYSTEM for RuleType .

          Currently, only Resolver can create  rules  that  have  a  value  of
          RECURSIVE for RuleType .

          Possible values:

          o FORWARD

          o SYSTEM

          o RECURSIVE

       --domain-name (string)
          DNS  queries  for this domain name are forwarded to the IP addresses
          that you specify in TargetIps . If a query matches multiple Resolver
          rules  (example.com  and  www.example.com), outbound DNS queries are
          routed using the Resolver  rule  that  contains  the  most  specific
          domain name (www.example.com).

       --target-ips (list)
          The  IPs  that  you want Resolver to forward DNS queries to. You can
          specify only IPv4 addresses. Separate IP addresses with a space.
              TargetIps is available only when the value of Rule type is  FOR-
              WARD .

          (structure)
              In  a  CreateResolverRule  request, an array of the IPs that you
              want to forward DNS queries to.

              Ip -> (string)
                 One IP address that you want to forward DNS queries  to.  You
                 can specify only IPv4 addresses.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port at Ip that you want to forward DNS queries to.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Ip=string,Port=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Ip": "string",
              "Port": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resolver-endpoint-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  outbound Resolver endpoint that you want to use to
          route DNS queries to the IP addresses that you specify in  TargetIps
          .

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  the tag keys and values that you want to associate with
          the endpoint.

          (structure)
              One tag that you want to add to the specified  resource.  A  tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  for the tag. For example, if you want to associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  for  the tag. For example, if Key is account-id ,
                 then Value might be the  ID  of  the  customer  account  that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a Resolver rule

       The  following create-resolver-rule example creates a Resolver forward-
       ing rule. The rule uses the outbound endpoint rslvr-out-d5e5920e37exam-
       ple   to  forward  DNS  queries  for  example.com  to  the  IP  address
       192.0.2.44.

          aws route53resolver create-resolver-rule \
              --creator-request-id 2020-01-02-18:47 \
              --domain-name example.com \
              --name my-rule \
              --resolver-endpoint-id rslvr-out-d5e5920e37example \
              --rule-type FORWARD \
              --target-ips="Ip=192.0.2.44"

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverRule": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "2020-01-02-18:47",

                  "RuleType": "FORWARD",
                  "Name": "my-rule",
                  "TargetIps": [
                      {
                          "Ip": "192.0.2.44",
                          "Port": 53
                      }
                  ],
                  "ResolverEndpointId": "rslvr-out-d5e5920e37example",

                  "ShareStatus": "NOT_SHARED"
              }
          }

       Alternatively, when you have complicated parameters with multiple  val-
       ues,  you  can choose to include the parameters in a JSON file and then
       specify the file when you call create-resolver-rule.  Here's  the  com-
       mand,  which  includes a parameter that specifies the name and location
       of the JSON file.

          aws route53resolver create-resolver-rule \
              --cli-input-json file://c:\temp\create-resolver-rule.json

       Contents of create-resolver-rule.json:

          {
              "CreatorRequestId": "2020-01-02-18:47",
              "Name": "my-rule",
              "RuleType": "FORWARD",
              "DomainName": "example.com",
              "TargetIps": [
                  {
                      "Ip": "192.0.2.44",
                      "Port": 53
                  }
              ],

OUTPUT
       ResolverRule -> (structure)
          Information about the CreateResolverRule request, including the sta-
          tus of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you cre-
              ated it.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that you specified when you created the Resolver
              rule. CreatorRequestId identifies the request and allows  failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver  rule  specified
              by Id .

          DomainName -> (string)
              DNS  queries  for  this  domain  name  are  forwarded  to the IP
              addresses that are specified in TargetIps . If a  query  matches
              multiple  Resolver  rules (example.com and www.example.com), the
              query is routed using the Resolver rule that contains  the  most
              specific domain name (www.example.com).

          Status -> (string)
              A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver rule.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.

          RuleType -> (string)
              When  you  want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name
              to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD .

              When you have a forwarding rule to forward  DNS  queries  for  a
              domain  to your network and you want Resolver to process queries
              for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM .

              For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers
              on your network, you create a rule and specify FORWARD for Rule-
              Type . To then have  Resolver  process  queries  for  apex.exam-
              ple.com, you create a rule and specify SYSTEM for RuleType .

              Currently,  only  Resolver can create rules that have a value of
              RECURSIVE for RuleType .

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the Resolver rule, which  you  specified  when  you
              created the Resolver rule.

          TargetIps -> (list)
              An  array  that contains the IP addresses and ports that an out-
              bound endpoint forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these are the
              IP  addresses  of  DNS  resolvers  on your network. Specify IPv4
              addresses. IPv6 is not supported.

              (structure)
                 In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that you
                 want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ip -> (string)
                     One  IP  address that you want to forward DNS queries to.
                     You can specify only IPv4 addresses.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port at Ip that you want to forward DNS queries to.

          ResolverEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              When a rule is shared with another Amazon Web Services  account,
              the account ID of the account that the rule is shared with.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              Whether  the  rule  is  shared  and,  if so, whether the current
              account is sharing the rule with  another  account,  or  another
              account is sharing the rule with the current account.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time that the Resolver rule was created, in Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the Resolver rule was  last  updated,  in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
