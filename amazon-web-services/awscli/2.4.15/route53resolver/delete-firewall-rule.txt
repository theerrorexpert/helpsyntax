DELETE-FIREWALL-RULE()                                  DELETE-FIREWALL-RULE()



NAME
       delete-firewall-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified firewall rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-firewall-rule
          --firewall-rule-group-id <value>
          --firewall-domain-list-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of the firewall rule group that you want to
          delete the rule from.

       --firewall-domain-list-id (string)
          The ID of the domain list that's used in the rule.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a firewall rule

       The following delete-firewall-rule example deletes a specified firewall
       rule.

          aws route53resolver delete-firewall-rule \
              --firewall-rule-group-id rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample \
              --firewall-domain-list-id rslvr-fdl-9e956e9ffexample

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRule": {
                  "FirewallRuleGroupId": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "FirewallDomainListId": "rslvr-fdl-9e956e9ffexample",
                  "Name": "allow-rule",
                  "Priority": 102,
                  "Action": "ALLOW",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "d81e3fb7-020b-415e-939f-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T21:44:00.346093Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T21:45:59.611600Z"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       FirewallRule -> (structure)
          The specification for the firewall rule that you just deleted.

          FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the firewall rule group of the rule.

          FirewallDomainListId -> (string)
              The ID of the domain list that's used in the rule.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the rule.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The priority of the rule in the rule group. This value  must  be
              unique  within  the rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules
              in a rule group by order of priority, starting from  the  lowest
              setting.

          Action -> (string)
              The  action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when it
              matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

              o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

              o ALERT - Permit the request to go through but send an alert  to
                the logs.

              o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If this is specified, additional
                handling details are provided in the rule's BlockResponse set-
                ting.

          BlockResponse -> (string)
              The  way  that  you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Used
              for the rule action setting BLOCK .

              o NODATA - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but
                no response is available for it.

              o NXDOMAIN  -  Respond indicating that the domain name that's in
                the query doesn't exist.

              o OVERRIDE - Provide a custom override  in  the  response.  This
                option  requires  custom handling details in the rule's Block-
                Override* settings.

          BlockOverrideDomain -> (string)
              The custom DNS record to send back in  response  to  the  query.
              Used  for  the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of
              OVERRIDE .

          BlockOverrideDnsType -> (string)
              The DNS record's type. This determines the format of the  record
              value  that  you  provided in BlockOverrideDomain . Used for the
              rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          BlockOverrideTtl -> (integer)
              The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver
              or  web  browser to cache the provided override record. Used for
              the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A  unique  string  defined  by you to identify the request. This
              allows you to retry failed requests without the risk of  execut-
              ing  the  operation  twice.  This  can be any unique string, for
              example, a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the rule was created, in Unix time format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The  date and time that the rule was last modified, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
