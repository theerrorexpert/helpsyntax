LIST-FIREWALL-CONFIGS()                                LIST-FIREWALL-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-firewall-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the firewall configurations that you have defined. DNS Fire-
       wall uses the configurations to manage firewall behavior for your VPCs.

       A  single  call might return only a partial list of the configurations.
       For information, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewall-configs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: FirewallConfigs

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewall-configs
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list firewall configs

       The following list-firewall-configs example  lists  your  DNS  Firewall
       configurations.

          aws route53resolver list-firewall-configs

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallConfigs": [
                  {
                      "Id": "rslvr-fc-86016850cexample",
                      "ResourceId": "vpc-31e92222",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "FirewallFailOpen": "DISABLED"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns  this
          token  in  the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       FirewallConfigs -> (list)
          The configurations for the firewall behavior provided by  DNS  Fire-
          wall for VPCs from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

          (structure)
              Configuration  of the firewall behavior provided by DNS Firewall
              for a single VPC from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the firewall configuration.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the VPC that this firewall configuration applies
                 to.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner  of  the  VPC
                 that this firewall configuration applies to.

              FirewallFailOpen -> (string)
                 Determines  how  DNS  Firewall  operates during failures, for
                 example when all traffic that is sent to DNS  Firewall  fails
                 to receive a reply.

                 o By  default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure
                   mode is closed. This approach favors security  over  avail-
                   ability.  DNS  Firewall  returns a failure error when it is
                   unable to properly evaluate a query.

                 o If you enable this option, the failure mode is  open.  This
                   approach  favors  availability  over security. DNS Firewall
                   allows queries to proceed if it is unable to properly eval-
                   uate them.

                 This  behavior  is  only enforced for VPCs that have at least
                 one DNS Firewall rule group association.
