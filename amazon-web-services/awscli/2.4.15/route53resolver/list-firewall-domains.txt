LIST-FIREWALL-DOMAINS()                                LIST-FIREWALL-DOMAINS()



NAME
       list-firewall-domains -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the domains that you have defined for the specified firewall
       domain list.

       A single call might return only a partial  list  of  the  domains.  For
       information, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewall-domains  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Domains

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewall-domains
          --firewall-domain-list-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-domain-list-id (string)
          The ID of the domain list whose domains you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list domains in a domain list

       The  following list-firewall-domains example lists the domains in a DNS
       Firewall domain list that you specify.

          aws route53resolver list-firewall-domains \
              --firewall-domain-list-id rslvr-fdl-d61cbb2cbexample

       Output:

          {
              "Domains": [
                  "test1.com.",
                  "test2.com.",
                  "test3.com."
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Managing your own domain lists in the  Amazon
       Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this
          token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of  objects,  pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       Domains -> (list)
          A list of the domains in the firewall domain list.

          This  might  be a partial list of the domains that you've defined in
          the domain list. For information, see MaxResults .
