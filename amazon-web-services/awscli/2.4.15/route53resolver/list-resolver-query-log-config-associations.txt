NAME
       list-resolver-query-log-config-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists information about associations between Amazon VPCs and query log-
       ging configurations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resolver-query-log-config-associations is a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must  extract  data  from  the
       results of the following query expressions: ResolverQueryLogConfigAsso-
       ciations

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An optional specification to return a subset of query logging  asso-
          ciations.

          NOTE:
              If  you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfi-
              gAssociations request and specify the NextToken  parameter,  you
              must  use the same values for Filters , if any, as in the previ-
              ous request.

          (structure)
              For   Resolver   list   operations   (ListResolverEndpoints    ,
              ListResolverRules      ,      ListResolverRuleAssociations     ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                                    ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations           ),          and
              ListResolverDnssecConfigs ), an optional specification to return
              a subset of objects.

              To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules,
              you specify Name and Values . For example, to list only  inbound
              Resolver  endpoints,  specify  Direction  for  Name  and specify
              INBOUND for Values .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter that you  want  to  use  to  filter
                 objects.

                 The  valid  values  for Name depend on the action that you're
                 including   the   filter    in,    ListResolverEndpoints    ,
                 ListResolverRules     ,     ListResolverRuleAssociations    ,
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigs               ,                or
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations .

                 NOTE:
                        In  early  versions  of Resolver, values for Name were
                        listed as uppercase, with underscore  (_)  delimiters.
                        For example, CreatorRequestId was originally listed as
                        CREATOR_REQUEST_ID . Uppercase  values  for  Name  are
                        still supported.

                     ListResolverEndpoints

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId  :  The  value that you specified when you
                   created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Direction : Whether you want to return inbound or  outbound
                   Resolver  endpoints.  If  you  specify DIRECTION for Name ,
                   specify INBOUND or OUTBOUND for Values .

                 o HostVPCId : The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass
                   through  on  the  way  from  your network to your VPCs in a
                   region, or the VPC that outbound queries  pass  through  on
                   the   way   from   your   VPCs   to   your  network.  In  a
                   CreateResolverEndpoint request, SubnetId indirectly identi-
                   fies  the VPC. In a GetResolverEndpoint request, the VPC ID
                   for a Resolver endpoint is returned in the  HostVPCId  ele-
                   ment.

                 o IpAddressCount  :  The number of IP addresses that you have
                   associated with the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver endpoint.

                 o SecurityGroupIds : The IDs of the VPC security groups  that
                   you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Status  : The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you spec-
                   ify Status for Name , specify one of the  following  status
                   codes  for  Values  :  CREATING  , OPERATIONAL , UPDATING ,
                   AUTO_RECOVERING , ACTION_NEEDED , or DELETING  .  For  more
                   information, see Status in ResolverEndpoint .
                     ListResolverRules

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId  :  The  value that you specified when you
                   created the Resolver rule.

                 o DomainName : The domain name for which Resolver is forward-
                   ing  DNS  queries  to  your  network. In the value that you
                   specify for Values , include a trailing dot (.)  after  the
                   domain  name.  For  example,  if  the  domain name is exam-
                   ple.com, specify the following value. Note  the  "."  after
                   com :  example.com.

                 o ResolverEndpointId  :  The ID of the Resolver endpoint that
                   the Resolver rule is associated with.

                 NOTE:
                     You can filter on the Resolver endpoint  only  for  rules
                     that have a value of FORWARD for RuleType .

                 o Status  :  The  status of the Resolver rule. If you specify
                   Status for Name , specify one of the following status codes
                   for Values : COMPLETE , DELETING , UPDATING , or FAILED .

              Values -> (list)
                 When you're using a List operation and you want the operation
                 to  return a subset of objects, such as Resolver endpoints or
                 Resolver rules, the value of the parameter that you  want  to
                 use  to  filter  objects.  For  example, to list only inbound
                 Resolver endpoints, specify Direction for  Name  and  specify
                 INBOUND for Values .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-by (string)
          The  element  that  you want Resolver to sort query logging associa-
          tions by.

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent  ListResolverQueryLogConfi-
              gAssociations  request  and specify the NextToken parameter, you
              must use the same value for SortBy , if any, as in the  previous
              request.

          Valid values include the following elements:

          o CreationTime : The ID of the query logging association.

          o Error  :  If  the  value  of Status is FAILED , the value of Error
            indicates the cause:

            o DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND : The specified destination (for  example,
              an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted.

            o ACCESS_DENIED : Permissions don't allow sending logs to the des-
              tination.

          If Status is a value other than FAILED , ERROR is null.

          o Id : The ID of the query logging association

          o ResolverQueryLogConfigId : The ID of the query logging  configura-
            tion

          o ResourceId  :  The ID of the VPC that is associated with the query
            logging configuration

          o Status : The current status of  the  configuration.  Valid  values
            include the following:

            o CREATING : Resolver is creating an association between an Amazon
              VPC and a query logging configuration.

            o CREATED : The association between an Amazon VPC and a query log-
              ging configuration was successfully created. Resolver is logging
              queries that originate in the specified VPC.

            o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging  association.

            o FAILED  : Resolver either couldn't create or couldn't delete the
              query logging association. Here are two common causes:

              o The specified destination (for example, an Amazon  S3  bucket)
                was deleted.

              o Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

       --sort-order (string)
          If  you specified a value for SortBy , the order that you want query
          logging associations to be listed in, ASCENDING or DESCENDING .

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent  ListResolverQueryLogConfi-
              gAssociations  request  and specify the NextToken parameter, you
              must use the same value for SortOrder , if any, as in the previ-
              ous request.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are more than MaxResults query  logging  associations,  you
          can submit another ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations request to
          get the next group of associations. In the next request, specify the
          value of NextToken from the previous response.

       TotalCount -> (integer)
          The  total number of query logging associations that were created by
          the current account in the specified Region. This count  can  differ
          from the number of associations that are returned in a ListResolver-
          QueryLogConfigAssociations response, depending on  the  values  that
          you specify in the request.

       TotalFilteredCount -> (integer)
          The  total number of query logging associations that were created by
          the current account in the specified Region and that match the  fil-
          ters  that  were specified in the ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssocia-
          tions request. For the total number of associations that  were  cre-
          ated  by the current account in the specified Region, see TotalCount
          .

       ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations -> (list)
          A list that contains one ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations  element
          for  each query logging association that matches the values that you
          specified for Filter .

          (structure)

              GetResolverQueryLogConfigAssociation            ,             or
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations , request, a complex type
              that contains settings for a specified  association  between  an
              Amazon VPC and a query logging configuration.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the query logging association.

              ResolverQueryLogConfigId -> (string)

                 ciated with.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon VPC that is associated  with  the  query
                 logging configuration.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status of the specified query logging association. Valid
                 values include the following:

                 o CREATING : Resolver is creating an association  between  an
                   Amazon VPC and a query logging configuration.

                 o CREATED : The association between an Amazon VPC and a query
                   logging configuration was successfully created. Resolver is
                   logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.

                 o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging associa-
                   tion.
