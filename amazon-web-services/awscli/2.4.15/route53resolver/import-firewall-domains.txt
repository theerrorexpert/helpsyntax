       o It can optionally start with * (asterisk).

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            import-firewall-domains
          --firewall-domain-list-id <value>
          --operation <value>
          --domain-file-url <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-domain-list-id (string)
          The ID of the domain list that you want to modify  with  the  import
          operation.

       --operation (string)
          What you want DNS Firewall to do with the domains that are listed in
          the file. This must be set to REPLACE ,  which  updates  the  domain
          list to exactly match the list in the file.

          Possible values:

          o REPLACE

       --domain-file-url (string)
          The  fully  qualified URL or URI of the file stored in Amazon Simple
          Storage Service (Amazon S3) that contains the  list  of  domains  to
          import.

          The  file  must be in an S3 bucket that's in the same Region as your
          DNS Firewall. The file must be a text file and must contain a single
          domain per line.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To import domains into a domain list

       The  following import-firewall-domains example imports a set of domains
       from a file into a DNS Firewall domain list that you specify.

          aws route53resolver import-firewall-domains \
              --firewall-domain-list-id rslvr-fdl-d61cbb2cbexample \
              --operation REPLACE \
              --domain-file-url s3://PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE

       Output:

          {
              "Id": "rslvr-fdl-d61cbb2cbexample",
              "Name": "test",
              "Status": "IMPORTING",
              "StatusMessage": "Importing domains from provided file."
          }

       Route 53 Developer Guide.
