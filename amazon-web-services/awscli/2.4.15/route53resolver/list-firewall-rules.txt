LIST-FIREWALL-RULES()                                    LIST-FIREWALL-RULES()



NAME
       list-firewall-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  firewall  rules that you have defined for the specified
       firewall rule group. DNS Firewall uses the rules in  a  rule  group  to
       filter DNS network traffic for a VPC.

       A single call might return only a partial list of the rules. For infor-
       mation, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewall-rules is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: FirewallRules

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewall-rules
          --firewall-rule-group-id <value>
          [--priority <value>]
          [--action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of the firewall rule group that you want to
          retrieve the rules for.

       --priority (integer)
          Optional additional filter for the rules to retrieve.

          The setting that determines the processing order of the rules  in  a
          rule  group.  DNS  Firewall  processes  the rules in a rule group by
          order of priority, starting from the lowest setting.

       --action (string)
          Optional additional filter for the rules to retrieve.

          The action that DNS Firewall should take on  a  DNS  query  when  it
          matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

          o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

          o ALERT  - Permit the request to go through but send an alert to the
            logs.

          o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If  this  is  specified,  additional
            handling details are provided in the rule's BlockResponse setting.

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o BLOCK

          o ALERT

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this
          token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of  objects,  pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       FirewallRules -> (list)
          A list of the rules that you have defined.

          This  might  be  a  partial  list  of the firewall rules that you've
          defined. For information, see MaxResults .

          (structure)
              A single firewall rule in a rule group.

              FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the firewall rule group of the rule.

              FirewallDomainListId -> (string)
                 The ID of the domain list that's used in the rule.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The  priority  of the rule in the rule group. This value must
                 be unique within the rule group. DNS Firewall  processes  the
                 rules in a rule group by order of priority, starting from the
                 lowest setting.

              Action -> (string)
                 The action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query  when
                 it matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

                 o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

                 o ALERT  - Permit the request to go through but send an alert
                   to the logs.

                 o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If this is  specified,  addi-
                   tional handling details are provided in the rule's BlockRe-
                   sponse setting.

              BlockResponse -> (string)
                 The way that you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Used
                 for the rule action setting BLOCK .

                 o NODATA  - Respond indicating that the query was successful,
                   but no response is available for it.

                 o NXDOMAIN - Respond indicating that the domain  name  that's
                   in the query doesn't exist.

                 o OVERRIDE  - Provide a custom override in the response. This
                   option requires  custom  handling  details  in  the  rule's
                   BlockOverride* settings.

              BlockOverrideDomain -> (string)
                 The  custom DNS record to send back in response to the query.
                 Used for the rule action BLOCK with a  BlockResponse  setting
                 of OVERRIDE .

              BlockOverrideDnsType -> (string)
                 The  DNS  record's  type.  This  determines the format of the
                 record value that you provided in BlockOverrideDomain .  Used
                 for  the  rule  action  BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of
                 OVERRIDE .

              BlockOverrideTtl -> (integer)
                 The recommended amount of  time,  in  seconds,  for  the  DNS
                 resolver  or  web  browser  to  cache  the  provided override
                 record. Used for the rule action BLOCK with  a  BlockResponse
                 setting of OVERRIDE .

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A  unique string defined by you to identify the request. This
                 allows you to retry failed requests without the risk of  exe-
                 cuting  the  operation  twice. This can be any unique string,
                 for example, a timestamp.

              CreationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the rule was  created,  in  Unix  time
                 format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

              ModificationTime -> (string)
                 The  date  and  time that the rule was last modified, in Unix
                 time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
