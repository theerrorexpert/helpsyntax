NAME
       list-resolver-query-log-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  information  about  the  specified query logging configurations.
       Each configuration defines where you want Resolver to  save  DNS  query
       logs and specifies the VPCs that you want to log queries for.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resolver-query-log-configs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ResolverQueryLogConfigs

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An optional specification to return a subset of query  logging  con-
          figurations.

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfigs
              request and specify the NextToken parameter, you  must  use  the
              same values for Filters , if any, as in the previous request.

          (structure)
              For    Resolver   list   operations   (ListResolverEndpoints   ,
              ListResolverRules     ,      ListResolverRuleAssociations      ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                                    ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations          ),           and
              ListResolverDnssecConfigs ), an optional specification to return
              a subset of objects.

              To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules,
              you  specify Name and Values . For example, to list only inbound
              Resolver endpoints,  specify  Direction  for  Name  and  specify
              INBOUND for Values .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  parameter  that you want to use to filter
                 objects.

                 The valid values for Name depend on the  action  that  you're
                 including    the    filter    in,   ListResolverEndpoints   ,
                 ListResolverRules    ,     ListResolverRuleAssociations     ,
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                ,               or
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations .

                 NOTE:
                        In early versions of Resolver, values  for  Name  were
                        listed  as  uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters.
                        For example, CreatorRequestId was originally listed as
                        CREATOR_REQUEST_ID  .  Uppercase  values  for Name are
                        still supported.

                     ListResolverEndpoints

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Direction  : Whether you want to return inbound or outbound
                   Resolver endpoints. If you specify  DIRECTION  for  Name  ,
                   specify INBOUND or OUTBOUND for Values .

                 o HostVPCId : The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass
                   through on the way from your network  to  your  VPCs  in  a
                   region,  or  the  VPC that outbound queries pass through on
                   the  way  from  your   VPCs   to   your   network.   In   a
                   CreateResolverEndpoint request, SubnetId indirectly identi-
                   fies the VPC. In a GetResolverEndpoint request, the VPC  ID
                   for  a  Resolver endpoint is returned in the HostVPCId ele-
                   ment.

                 o IpAddressCount : The number of IP addresses that  you  have
                   associated with the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver endpoint.

                 o SecurityGroupIds  : The IDs of the VPC security groups that
                   you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you  spec-
                   ify  Status  for Name , specify one of the following status
                   codes for Values : CREATING  ,  OPERATIONAL  ,  UPDATING  ,
                   AUTO_RECOVERING  ,  ACTION_NEEDED  , or DELETING . For more
                   information, see Status in ResolverEndpoint .
                     ListResolverRules

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver rule.

                 o DomainName : The domain name for which Resolver is forward-
                   ing DNS queries to your network.  In  the  value  that  you
                   specify  for  Values , include a trailing dot (.) after the
                   domain name. For example,  if  the  domain  name  is  exam-
                   ple.com,  specify  the  following value. Note the "." after
                   com :  example.com.

                 o ResolverEndpointId : The ID of the Resolver  endpoint  that
                   the Resolver rule is associated with.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can  filter  on the Resolver endpoint only for rules
                     that have a value of FORWARD for RuleType .

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver rule.  If  you  specify
                   Status for Name , specify one of the following status codes
                   for Values : COMPLETE , DELETING , UPDATING , or FAILED .

              Values -> (list)
                 When you're using a List operation and you want the operation
                 to return a subset of objects, such as Resolver endpoints  or
                 Resolver  rules,  the value of the parameter that you want to
                 use to filter objects. For  example,  to  list  only  inbound
                 Resolver  endpoints,  specify  Direction for Name and specify
                 INBOUND for Values .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-by (string)
          The element that you want Resolver to sort query logging  configura-
          tions by.

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfigs
              request and specify the NextToken parameter, you  must  use  the
              same value for SortBy , if any, as in the previous request.

          Valid values include the following elements:

          o Arn : The ARN of the query logging configuration

          o AssociationCount : The number of VPCs that are associated with the
            specified configuration

          o CreationTime : The date and time that Resolver returned  when  the
            configuration was created

          o CreatorRequestId  :  The  value  that was specified for CreatorRe-
            questId when the configuration was created

          o DestinationArn : The location that logs are sent to

          o Id : The ID of the configuration

          o Name : The name of the configuration

          o OwnerId : The Amazon Web Services account number  of  the  account
            that created the configuration

          o ShareStatus  : Whether the configuration is shared with other Ama-
            zon Web Services accounts or shared with the  current  account  by
            another Amazon Web Services account. Sharing is configured through
            Resource Access Manager (RAM).

          o Status : The current status of  the  configuration.  Valid  values
            include the following:

            o CREATING : Resolver is creating the query logging configuration.

            o CREATED : The query logging configuration was successfully  cre-
              ated.  Resolver  is logging queries that originate in the speci-
              fied VPC.

            o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this  query  logging  configura-
              tion.

            o FAILED  : Resolver either couldn't create or couldn't delete the
              query logging configuration. Here are two common causes:

              o The specified destination (for example, an Amazon  S3  bucket)
                was deleted.

              o Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

       --sort-order (string)
          If  you specified a value for SortBy , the order that you want query
          logging configurations to be listed in, ASCENDING or DESCENDING .

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfigs
              request  and  specify  the NextToken parameter, you must use the
              same value for SortOrder , if any, as in the previous request.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there are more than MaxResults query logging configurations, you
          can submit another ListResolverQueryLogConfigs request  to  get  the
          next group of configurations. In the next request, specify the value
          of NextToken from the previous response.

       TotalCount -> (integer)
          The total number of query logging configurations that  were  created
          by  the current account in the specified Region. This count can dif-
          fer from  the  number  of  query  logging  configurations  that  are
          returned in a ListResolverQueryLogConfigs response, depending on the
          values that you specify in the request.

       TotalFilteredCount -> (integer)
          The total number of query logging configurations that  were  created
          by  the  current  account in the specified Region and that match the
          filters  that  were  specified  in  the  ListResolverQueryLogConfigs
          request.  For  the total number of query logging configurations that
          were created by the current account in  the  specified  Region,  see
          TotalCount .

       ResolverQueryLogConfigs -> (list)
          A  list  that  contains  one ResolverQueryLogConfig element for each
          query logging configuration that matches the values that you  speci-
          fied for Filter .

          (structure)
              In    the   response   to   a   CreateResolverQueryLogConfig   ,
              DeleteResolverQueryLogConfig ,  GetResolverQueryLogConfig  ,  or
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs  request,  a  complex type that con-
              tains settings for one query logging configuration.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID for the query logging configuration.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that  cre-
                 ated the query logging configuration.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the  specified  query logging configuration.
                 Valid values include the following:

                 o CREATING : Resolver is creating the query logging  configu-
                   ration.

                 o CREATED  : The query logging configuration was successfully
                   created. Resolver is logging queries that originate in  the
                   specified VPC.

                 o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging configu-
                   ration.

                 o FAILED : Resolver can't deliver logs to the  location  that
                   is  specified  in the query logging configuration. Here are
                   two common causes:

                   o The specified destination  (for  example,  an  Amazon  S3
