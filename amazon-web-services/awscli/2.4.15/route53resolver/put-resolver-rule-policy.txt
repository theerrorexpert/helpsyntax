NAME
       put-resolver-rule-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Specifies  an  Amazon  Web  Services  rule  that you want to share with
       another account, the account that you want to share the rule with,  and
       the  operations  that you want the account to be able to perform on the
       rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-resolver-rule-policy
          --arn <value>
          --resolver-rule-policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule that you  want  to  share
          with another account.

       --resolver-rule-policy (string)
          An  Identity  and  Access Management policy statement that lists the
          rules that you want  to  share  with  another  Amazon  Web  Services
          account  and  the operations that you want the account to be able to
          perform. You can specify the following operations in the Action sec-
          tion of the statement:

          o route53resolver:GetResolverRule

          o route53resolver:AssociateResolverRule

          o route53resolver:DisassociateResolverRule

          o route53resolver:ListResolverRules

          o route53resolver:ListResolverRuleAssociations

          In  the  Resource  section of the statement, specify the ARN for the
          rule that you want to share with another account. Specify  the  same
          ARN that you specified in Arn .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To share a Resolver rule with another AWS account

       The  following  put-resolver-rule-policy  example  specifies a Resolver
       rule that you want to share with another AWS account, the account  that
       you  want  to share the rule with, and the rule-related operations that
       you want the account to be able to perform on the rules.

       Note You must run this command using credentials from the same  account
       that created the rule.

          aws route53resolver put-resolver-rule-policy \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --arn "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-east-1:111122223333:resolver-rule/rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example" \
              --resolver-rule-policy "{\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \
                  \"Statement\": [ { \
                  \"Effect\" : \"Allow\", \
                  \"Principal\" : {\"AWS\" : \"444455556666\" }, \
                  \"Action\" : [ \
                      \"route53resolver:GetResolverRule\", \
                      \"route53resolver:AssociateResolverRule\", \
                      \"route53resolver:DisassociateResolverRule\", \
                      \"route53resolver:ListResolverRules\", \
                      \"route53resolver:ListResolverRuleAssociations\" ], \
                  \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:route53resolver:us-east-1:111122223333:resolver-rule/rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example\" ] } ] }"

       Output:

          {
              "ReturnValue": true
          }

       After  you  run put-resolver-rule-policy, you can run the following two
       Resource Access Manager (RAM) commands. You must use the  account  that
       you want to share the rule with:

       o get-resource-share-invitations returns the value resourceShareInvita-
         tionArn. You need this value to accept  the  invitation  to  use  the
         shared rule.

       o accept-resource-share-invitation  accepts  the  invitation to use the
         shared rule.

       For more information, see the following documentation:

       o get-resource-share-invitations

       o accept-resource-share-invitations

       o Sharing Forwarding Rules with Other AWS  Accounts  and  Using  Shared
         Rules in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide

OUTPUT
       ReturnValue -> (boolean)
          Whether the PutResolverRulePolicy request was successful.
