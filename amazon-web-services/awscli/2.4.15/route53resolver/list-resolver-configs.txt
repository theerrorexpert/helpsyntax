LIST-RESOLVER-CONFIGS()                                LIST-RESOLVER-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-resolver-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  Resolver configurations that you have defined. Route 53
       Resolver uses the configurations to manage DNS resolution behavior  for
       your VPCs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resolver-configs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ResolverConfigs

SYNOPSIS
            list-resolver-configs
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  a response includes the last of the Resolver configurations that
          are associated with the current Amazon Web Services account, NextTo-
          ken doesn't appear in the response.

          If  a  response  doesn't include the last of the configurations, you
          can get more configurations by submitting  another  ListResolverCon-
          figs  request.  Get  the  value  of  NextToken  that Amazon Route 53
          returned in the previous response and include it in NextToken in the
          next request.

       ResolverConfigs -> (list)
          An array that contains one ResolverConfigs element for each Resolver
          configuration that is associated with the current  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices account.

          (structure)
              A  complex  type that contains information about a Resolver con-
              figuration for a VPC.

              Id -> (string)
                 ID for the Resolver configuration.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud  VPC  that  you're
                 configuring Resolver for.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The owner account ID of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC.

              AutodefinedReverse -> (string)
                 The status of whether or not the Resolver will create autode-
                 fined  rules  for  reverse  DNS  lookups.  This is enabled by
                 default. The status can be one of following:

                 Status of the rules generated by VPCs  based  on  CIDR/Region
                 for  reverse DNS resolution. The status can be one of follow-
                 ing:

                 o ENABLING: Autodefined rules for  reverse  DNS  lookups  are
                   being enabled but are not complete.

                 o ENABLED:  Autodefined  rules  for  reverse  DNS lookups are
                   enabled.

                 o DISABLING: Autodefined rules for reverse  DNS  lookups  are
                   being disabled but are not complete.

                 o DISABLED:  Autodefined  rules  for  reverse DNS lookups are
                   disabled.
