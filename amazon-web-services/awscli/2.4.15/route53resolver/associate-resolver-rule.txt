ASSOCIATE-RESOLVER-RULE()                            ASSOCIATE-RESOLVER-RULE()



NAME
       associate-resolver-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates a Resolver rule with a VPC. When you associate a rule with a
       VPC, Resolver forwards all DNS queries for  the  domain  name  that  is
       specified  in  the  rule and that originate in the VPC. The queries are
       forwarded to the IP addresses for the DNS resolvers that are  specified
       in the rule. For more information about rules, see CreateResolverRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-resolver-rule
          --resolver-rule-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          --vpc-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-rule-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver rule that you want to associate with the VPC.
          To list the existing Resolver rules, use ListResolverRules .

       --name (string)
          A  name  for the association that you're creating between a Resolver
          rule and a VPC.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC that you want to associate the Resolver rule with.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate a Resolver rule with a VPC

       The  following  associate-resolver-rule  example  associates a Resolver
       rule with an Amazon VPC. After you run the command, Resolver starts  to
       forward  DNS queries to your network based on the settings in the rule,
       such as the domain name of the queries that are forwarded.

          aws route53resolver associate-resolver-rule \
              --name my-resolver-rule-association \
              --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example \
              --vpc-id vpc-304bexam

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverRuleAssociation": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-rrassoc-d61cbb2c8bexample",
                  "ResolverRuleId": "rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example",
                  "Name": "my-resolver-rule-association",
                  "VPCId": "vpc-304bexam",
                  "Status": "CREATING",
                  "StatusMessage": "[Trace id: 1-5dc5a8fa-ec2cc480d2ef07617example] Creating the association."
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ResolverRuleAssociation -> (structure)

          status of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the association between a Resolver  rule  and  a  VPC.
              Resolver    assigns    this    value    when   you   submit   an
              AssociateResolverRule request.

          ResolverRuleId -> (string)
              The ID of the Resolver rule that you  associated  with  the  VPC
              that is specified by VPCId .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of an association between a Resolver rule and a VPC.

          VPCId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC that you associated the Resolver rule with.

          Status -> (string)
              A  code  that  specifies  the  current status of the association
              between a Resolver rule and a VPC.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of the association  between
              a Resolver rule and a VPC.
