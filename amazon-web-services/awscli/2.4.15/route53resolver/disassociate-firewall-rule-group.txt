DISASSOCIATE-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP()          DISASSOCIATE-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP()



NAME
       disassociate-firewall-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a  FirewallRuleGroup from a VPC, to remove DNS filtering
       from the VPC.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-firewall-rule-group
          --firewall-rule-group-association-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-association-id (string)
          The identifier of the  FirewallRuleGroupAssociation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disassociate a firewall rule group from a VPC

       The following disassociate-firewall-rule-group example disassociates  a
       DNS Firewall rule group from an Amazon VPC.

          aws route53resolver disassociate-firewall-rule-group \
              --firewall-rule-group-association-id rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRuleGroupAssociation": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-rule-group-association/rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example",
                  "FirewallRuleGroupId": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-31e92222",
                  "Name": "test-association",
                  "Priority": 103,
                  "MutationProtection": "DISABLED",
                  "Status": "DELETING",
                  "StatusMessage": "Deleting the Firewall Rule Group Association",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "2ca1a304-32b3-4f5f-bc4c-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T21:47:48.755768Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T21:51:02.377887Z"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       FirewallRuleGroupAssociation -> (structure)
          The firewall rule group association that you just removed.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier for the association.

          Arn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall rule group asso-
              ciation.

          FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the firewall rule group.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the VPC that  is  associated  with  the
              rule group.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the association.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The  setting  that  determines  the processing order of the rule
              group among the rule groups that are associated  with  a  single
              VPC.  DNS  Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from rule group
              with the lowest numeric priority setting.

          MutationProtection -> (string)
              If enabled, this setting disallows modification  or  removal  of
              the  association,  to help prevent against accidentally altering
              DNS firewall protections.

          ManagedOwnerName -> (string)
              The owner of the association, used only  for  associations  that
              are  not  managed  by you. If you use Firewall Manager to manage
              your DNS Firewalls, then this reports Firewall  Manager  as  the
              managed owner.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the association.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Additional  information  about  the  status  of the response, if
              available.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to  identify  the  request.  This
              allows  you to retry failed requests without the risk of running
              the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example,
              a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the association was created, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the association  was  last  modified,  in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
