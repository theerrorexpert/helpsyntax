LIST-RESOLVER-RULES()                                    LIST-RESOLVER-RULES()



NAME
       list-resolver-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the Resolver rules that were created using the current Amazon Web
       Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resolver-rules is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ResolverRules

SYNOPSIS
            list-resolver-rules
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An optional specification to return a subset of Resolver rules, such
          as all Resolver rules that are associated  with  the  same  Resolver
          endpoint.

          NOTE:
              If  you  submit a second or subsequent ListResolverRules request
              and specify the NextToken parameter, you must use the same  val-
              ues for Filters , if any, as in the previous request.

          (structure)
              For    Resolver   list   operations   (ListResolverEndpoints   ,
              ListResolverRules     ,      ListResolverRuleAssociations      ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                                    ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations          ),           and
              ListResolverDnssecConfigs ), an optional specification to return
              a subset of objects.

              To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules,
              you  specify Name and Values . For example, to list only inbound
              Resolver endpoints,  specify  Direction  for  Name  and  specify
              INBOUND for Values .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  parameter  that you want to use to filter
                 objects.

                 The valid values for Name depend on the  action  that  you're
                 including    the    filter    in,   ListResolverEndpoints   ,
                 ListResolverRules    ,     ListResolverRuleAssociations     ,
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                ,               or
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations .

                 NOTE:
                        In early versions of Resolver, values  for  Name  were
                        listed  as  uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters.
                        For example, CreatorRequestId was originally listed as
                        CREATOR_REQUEST_ID  .  Uppercase  values  for Name are
                        still supported.

                     ListResolverEndpoints

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Direction  : Whether you want to return inbound or outbound
                   Resolver endpoints. If you specify  DIRECTION  for  Name  ,
                   specify INBOUND or OUTBOUND for Values .

                 o HostVPCId : The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass
                   through on the way from your network  to  your  VPCs  in  a
                   region,  or  the  VPC that outbound queries pass through on
                   the  way  from  your   VPCs   to   your   network.   In   a
                   CreateResolverEndpoint request, SubnetId indirectly identi-
                   fies the VPC. In a GetResolverEndpoint request, the VPC  ID
                   for  a  Resolver endpoint is returned in the HostVPCId ele-
                   ment.

                 o IpAddressCount : The number of IP addresses that  you  have
                   associated with the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver endpoint.

                 o SecurityGroupIds  : The IDs of the VPC security groups that
                   you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you  spec-
                   ify  Status  for Name , specify one of the following status
                   codes for Values : CREATING  ,  OPERATIONAL  ,  UPDATING  ,
                   AUTO_RECOVERING  ,  ACTION_NEEDED  , or DELETING . For more
                   information, see Status in ResolverEndpoint .
                     ListResolverRules

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver rule.

                 o DomainName : The domain name for which Resolver is forward-
                   ing DNS queries to your network.  In  the  value  that  you
                   specify  for  Values , include a trailing dot (.) after the
                   domain name. For example,  if  the  domain  name  is  exam-
                   ple.com,  specify  the  following value. Note the "." after
                   com :  example.com.

                 o ResolverEndpointId : The ID of the Resolver  endpoint  that
                   the Resolver rule is associated with.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can  filter  on the Resolver endpoint only for rules
                     that have a value of FORWARD for RuleType .

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver rule.  If  you  specify
                   Status for Name , specify one of the following status codes
                   for Values : COMPLETE , DELETING , UPDATING , or FAILED .

                 o Type : The type of the Resolver rule. If you  specify  TYPE
                   for Name , specify FORWARD or SYSTEM for Values .

                 o Status : The status of the query  logging  association.  If
                   you specify Status for Name , specify the applicable status
                   code for Values : CREATING , CREATED , DELETING , or FAILED
                   . For more information, see Status .

              Values -> (list)
                 When you're using a List operation and you want the operation
                 to return a subset of objects, such as Resolver endpoints  or
                 Resolver  rules,  the value of the parameter that you want to
                 use to filter objects. For  example,  to  list  only  inbound
                 Resolver  endpoints,  specify  Direction for Name and specify
                 INBOUND for Values .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If more than MaxResults Resolver rules match the specified criteria,
          you  can  submit  another  ListResolverRules request to get the next
          group of results. In the next request, specify the value of  NextTo-
          ken from the previous response.

       MaxResults -> (integer)
          The value that you specified for MaxResults in the request.

       ResolverRules -> (list)
          The  Resolver  rules  that were created using the current Amazon Web
          Services account and that match the specified filters, if any.

          (structure)
              For queries that originate in  your  VPC,  detailed  information
              about  a Resolver rule, which specifies how to route DNS queries
              out of the  VPC.  The  ResolverRule  parameter  appears  in  the
              response   to   a   CreateResolverRule  ,  DeleteResolverRule  ,
              GetResolverRule  ,  ListResolverRules  ,  or  UpdateResolverRule
              request.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID  that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you
                 created it.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string that  you  specified  when  you  created  the
                 Resolver  rule.  CreatorRequestId  identifies the request and
                 allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of run-
                 ning the operation twice.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver rule speci-
                 fied by Id .

              DomainName -> (string)
                 DNS queries for this domain name  are  forwarded  to  the  IP
                 addresses  that  are  specified  in  TargetIps  .  If a query
                 matches multiple Resolver rules  (example.com  and  www.exam-
                 ple.com),  the  query  is routed using the Resolver rule that
                 contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com).

              Status -> (string)
                 A code that specifies the  current  status  of  the  Resolver
                 rule.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.

              RuleType -> (string)
                 When  you  want  to  forward DNS queries for specified domain
                 name to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD .

                 When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for  a
                 domain  to  your  network  and  you  want Resolver to process
                 queries for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM .

                 For example,  to  forward  DNS  queries  for  example.com  to
                 resolvers on your network, you create a rule and specify FOR-
                 WARD for RuleType . To then have Resolver process queries for
                 apex.example.com,  you  create  a rule and specify SYSTEM for
                 RuleType .

                 Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have  a  value
                 of RECURSIVE for RuleType .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name for the Resolver rule, which you specified when you
                 created the Resolver rule.

              TargetIps -> (list)
                 An array that contains the IP addresses  and  ports  that  an
                 outbound  endpoint  forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these
                 are the IP addresses of DNS resolvers on your network.  Spec-
                 ify IPv4 addresses. IPv6 is not supported.

                 (structure)
                     In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that
                     you want to forward DNS queries to.

                     Ip -> (string)
                        One IP address that you want to  forward  DNS  queries
                        to. You can specify only IPv4 addresses.

                     Port -> (integer)
                        The  port  at  Ip that you want to forward DNS queries
                        to.

              ResolverEndpointId -> (string)
                 The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 When a rule  is  shared  with  another  Amazon  Web  Services
                 account,  the  account  ID  of  the  account that the rule is
                 shared with.

              ShareStatus -> (string)
                 Whether the rule is shared and, if so,  whether  the  current
                 account  is sharing the rule with another account, or another
                 account is sharing the rule with the current account.

              CreationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the Resolver rule was created, in Unix
                 time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

              ModificationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the Resolver rule was last updated, in
                 Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
