          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and that allows  you  to
          retry  failed  requests  without  the  risk of running the operation
          twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique  string,  for  example,  a
          date/time stamp.

       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the firewall rule group where you want to
          create the rule.

       --firewall-domain-list-id (string)
          The ID of the domain list that you want to use in the rule.

       --priority (integer)
          The setting that determines the processing order of the rule in  the
          rule  group.  DNS  Firewall  processes  the rules in a rule group by
          order of priority, starting from the lowest setting.

          You must specify a unique priority for each rule in a rule group. To
          make  it  easier to insert rules later, leave space between the num-
          bers, for example, use 100, 200, and so on. You can change the  pri-
          ority setting for the rules in a rule group at any time.

       --action (string)
          The  action  that  DNS  Firewall  should take on a DNS query when it
          matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

          o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

          o ALERT - Permit the request and send  metrics  and  logs  to  Cloud
            Watch.

          o BLOCK  -  Disallow  the  request.  This option requires additional
            details in the rule's BlockResponse .

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o BLOCK

          o ALERT

       --block-response (string)
          The way that you want DNS Firewall to block the request,  used  with
          the rule action setting BLOCK .

          o NODATA  - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but no
            response is available for it.

          o NXDOMAIN - Respond indicating that the domain name that's  in  the
            query doesn't exist.

          o OVERRIDE  - Provide a custom override in the response. This option
            requires custom handling details in the rule's BlockOverride* set-
            tings.

          This setting is required if the rule action setting is BLOCK .

          Possible values:

          o NODATA

          o NXDOMAIN

          o OVERRIDE

       --block-override-domain (string)
          The  custom  DNS  record to send back in response to the query. Used
          for the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          This  setting is required if the BlockResponse setting is OVERRIDE .

       --block-override-dns-type (string)
          The DNS record's type. This determines  the  format  of  the  record
          value  that  you provided in BlockOverrideDomain . Used for the rule
          action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          This setting is required if the BlockResponse setting is OVERRIDE  .

          Possible values:

          o CNAME

       --block-override-ttl (integer)
          The  recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver or
          web browser to cache the provided override record. Used for the rule
          action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          This  setting is required if the BlockResponse setting is OVERRIDE .

       --name (string)
          A name that lets you identify the rule in the rule group.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a firewall rule

       The following create-firewall-rule example creates a firewall rule in a
       DNS Firewall rule for domains listed in a DNS Firewall domain list.

          aws route53resolver create-firewall-rule \
              --name allow-rule \
              --firewall-rule-group-id rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample \
              --firewall-domain-list-id rslvr-fdl-9e956e9ffexample \
              --priority 101 \
              --action ALLOW

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRule": {
                  "FirewallRuleGroupId": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "FirewallDomainListId": "rslvr-fdl-9e956e9ffexample",
                  "Name": "allow-rule",
                  "Priority": 101,
                  "Action": "ALLOW",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "d81e3fb7-020b-415e-939f-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T21:44:00.346093Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T21:44:00.346093Z"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       FirewallRule -> (structure)
          The firewall rule that you just created.

          FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the firewall rule group of the rule.

          FirewallDomainListId -> (string)
              The ID of the domain list that's used in the rule.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the rule.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The priority of the rule in the rule group. This value  must  be
              unique  within  the rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules
              in a rule group by order of priority, starting from  the  lowest
              setting.

          Action -> (string)
              The  action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when it
              matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

              o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

              o ALERT - Permit the request to go through but send an alert  to
                the logs.

              o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If this is specified, additional
                handling details are provided in the rule's BlockResponse set-
                ting.

          BlockResponse -> (string)
              The  way  that  you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Used
              for the rule action setting BLOCK .

              o NODATA - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but
                no response is available for it.

              o NXDOMAIN  -  Respond indicating that the domain name that's in
                the query doesn't exist.

              o OVERRIDE - Provide a custom override  in  the  response.  This
                option  requires  custom handling details in the rule's Block-
                Override* settings.

          BlockOverrideDomain -> (string)
              The custom DNS record to send back in  response  to  the  query.
              Used  for  the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of
              OVERRIDE .

          BlockOverrideDnsType -> (string)
              The DNS record's type. This determines the format of the  record
              value  that  you  provided in BlockOverrideDomain . Used for the
              rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          BlockOverrideTtl -> (integer)
              The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver
              or  web  browser to cache the provided override record. Used for
              the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A  unique  string  defined  by you to identify the request. This
              allows you to retry failed requests without the risk of  execut-
              ing  the  operation  twice.  This  can be any unique string, for
              example, a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the rule was created, in Unix time format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The  date and time that the rule was last modified, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
