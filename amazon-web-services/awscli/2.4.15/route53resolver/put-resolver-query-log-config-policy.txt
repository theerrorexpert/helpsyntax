       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-resolver-query-log-config-policy
          --arn <value>
          --resolver-query-log-config-policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the account that you want to share
          rules with.

       --resolver-query-log-config-policy (string)
          An  Identity  and  Access Management policy statement that lists the
          query logging configurations that you want  to  share  with  another
          Amazon  Web  Services  account  and the operations that you want the
          account to be able to perform. You can specify the following  opera-
          tions in the Actions section of the statement:

          o route53resolver:AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig

          o route53resolver:DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig

          o route53resolver:ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations

          o route53resolver:ListResolverQueryLogConfigs

          In  the  Resource section of the statement, you specify the ARNs for
          the query logging configurations that you want  to  share  with  the
          account that you specified in Arn .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ReturnValue -> (boolean)
          Whether  the PutResolverQueryLogConfigPolicy request was successful.
