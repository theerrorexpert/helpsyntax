NAME
       create-firewall-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  empty  DNS  Firewall  rule group for filtering DNS network
       traffic in a VPC. You can add rules to the new rule  group  by  calling
       CreateFirewallRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-firewall-rule-group
          [--creator-request-id <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          A  unique string defined by you to identify the request. This allows
          you to retry failed requests without the risk of running the  opera-
          tion twice. This can be any unique string, for example, a timestamp.

       --name (string)
          A name that lets you identify the rule group, to manage and use  it.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  the tag keys and values that you want to associate with
          the rule group.

          (structure)
              One tag that you want to add to the specified  resource.  A  tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  for the tag. For example, if you want to associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  for  the tag. For example, if Key is account-id ,
                 then Value might be the  ID  of  the  customer  account  that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a Firewall rule group

       The following create-firewall-rule-group example creates a DNS Firewall
       rule group.

          aws route53resolver create-firewall-rule-group \
              --creator-request-id my-request-id \
              --name test

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRuleGroup": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-rule-group/rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "Name": "test",
                  "RuleCount": 0,
                  "Status": "COMPLETE",
                  "StatusMessage": "Created Firewall Rule Group",
                  "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "my-request-id",
                  "ShareStatus": "NOT_SHARED",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T18:59:26.490017Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T18:59:26.490017Z"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       FirewallRuleGroup -> (structure)
          A collection of rules used to filter DNS network traffic.

              The ID of the rule group.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the rule group.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the rule group.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that  created
              the  rule  group. When a rule group is shared with your account,
              this is the account that has shared the rule group with you.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to  identify  the  request.  This

              Whether  the rule group is shared with other Amazon Web Services
              accounts, or was shared with the current account by another Ama-
              zon Web Services account. Sharing is configured through Resource
              Access Manager (RAM).

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the rule group was created, in Unix  time
