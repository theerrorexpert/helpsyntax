DELETE-RESOLVER-RULE()                                  DELETE-RESOLVER-RULE()



NAME
       delete-resolver-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  Resolver  rule.  Before you can delete a Resolver rule, you
       must disassociate it from all the VPCs that you associated the Resolver
       rule with. For more information, see DisassociateResolverRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-resolver-rule
          --resolver-rule-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-rule-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver rule that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a Resolver rule

       The  following delete-resolver-rule example deletes the specified rule.

       Note If a rule is associated with any VPCs, you must first disassociate
       the rule from the VPCs before you can delete it.

OUTPUT
       ResolverRule -> (structure)
          Information about the DeleteResolverRule request, including the sta-
          tus of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you cre-
              ated it.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that you specified when you created the Resolver
              rule. CreatorRequestId identifies the request and allows  failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver  rule  specified
              by Id .

          DomainName -> (string)
              DNS  queries  for  this  domain  name  are  forwarded  to the IP
              addresses that are specified in TargetIps . If a  query  matches
              multiple  Resolver  rules (example.com and www.example.com), the
              query is routed using the Resolver rule that contains  the  most
              specific domain name (www.example.com).

          Status -> (string)
              A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver rule.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.

          RuleType -> (string)
              When  you  want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name
              to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD .

              When you have a forwarding rule to forward  DNS  queries  for  a
              domain  to your network and you want Resolver to process queries
              for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM .

              For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers
              on your network, you create a rule and specify FORWARD for Rule-
              Type . To then have  Resolver  process  queries  for  apex.exam-
              ple.com, you create a rule and specify SYSTEM for RuleType .

              Currently,  only  Resolver can create rules that have a value of
              RECURSIVE for RuleType .

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the Resolver rule, which  you  specified  when  you
              created the Resolver rule.

          TargetIps -> (list)
              An  array  that contains the IP addresses and ports that an out-
              bound endpoint forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these are the
              IP  addresses  of  DNS  resolvers  on your network. Specify IPv4
              addresses. IPv6 is not supported.

              (structure)
                 In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that you
                 want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ip -> (string)
                     One  IP  address that you want to forward DNS queries to.
                     You can specify only IPv4 addresses.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port at Ip that you want to forward DNS queries to.

          ResolverEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              When a rule is shared with another Amazon Web Services  account,
              the account ID of the account that the rule is shared with.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              Whether  the  rule  is  shared  and,  if so, whether the current
              account is sharing the rule with  another  account,  or  another
              account is sharing the rule with the current account.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time that the Resolver rule was created, in Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the Resolver rule was  last  updated,  in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
