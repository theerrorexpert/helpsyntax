NAME
       list-resolver-rule-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  associations  that  were created between Resolver rules and
       VPCs using the current Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resolver-rule-associations is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ResolverRuleAssociations

SYNOPSIS
            list-resolver-rule-associations
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An optional specification to return a subset of Resolver rules, such
          as Resolver rules that are associated with the same VPC ID.

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second  or  subsequent  ListResolverRuleAssocia-
              tions  request and specify the NextToken parameter, you must use
              the same values for  Filters  ,  if  any,  as  in  the  previous
              request.

          (structure)
              For    Resolver   list   operations   (ListResolverEndpoints   ,
              ListResolverRules     ,      ListResolverRuleAssociations      ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                                    ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations          ),           and
              ListResolverDnssecConfigs ), an optional specification to return
              a subset of objects.

              To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules,
              you  specify Name and Values . For example, to list only inbound
              Resolver endpoints,  specify  Direction  for  Name  and  specify
              INBOUND for Values .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  parameter  that you want to use to filter
                 objects.

                 The valid values for Name depend on the  action  that  you're
                 including    the    filter    in,   ListResolverEndpoints   ,
                 ListResolverRules    ,     ListResolverRuleAssociations     ,
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                ,               or
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations .

                 NOTE:
                        In early versions of Resolver, values  for  Name  were
                        listed  as  uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters.
                        For example, CreatorRequestId was originally listed as
                        CREATOR_REQUEST_ID  .  Uppercase  values  for Name are
                        still supported.

                     ListResolverEndpoints

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Direction  : Whether you want to return inbound or outbound
                   Resolver endpoints. If you specify  DIRECTION  for  Name  ,
                   specify INBOUND or OUTBOUND for Values .

                 o HostVPCId : The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass
                   through on the way from your network  to  your  VPCs  in  a
                   region,  or  the  VPC that outbound queries pass through on
                   the  way  from  your   VPCs   to   your   network.   In   a
                   CreateResolverEndpoint request, SubnetId indirectly identi-
                   fies the VPC. In a GetResolverEndpoint request, the VPC  ID
                   for  a  Resolver endpoint is returned in the HostVPCId ele-
                   ment.

                 o IpAddressCount : The number of IP addresses that  you  have
                   associated with the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver endpoint.

                 o SecurityGroupIds  : The IDs of the VPC security groups that
                   you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you  spec-
                   ify  Status  for Name , specify one of the following status
                   codes for Values : CREATING  ,  OPERATIONAL  ,  UPDATING  ,
                   AUTO_RECOVERING  ,  ACTION_NEEDED  , or DELETING . For more
                   information, see Status in ResolverEndpoint .
                     ListResolverRules

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver rule.

                 o DomainName : The domain name for which Resolver is forward-
                   ing DNS queries to your network.  In  the  value  that  you
                   specify  for  Values , include a trailing dot (.) after the
                   domain name. For example,  if  the  domain  name  is  exam-
                   ple.com,  specify  the  following value. Note the "." after
                   com :  example.com.

                 o ResolverEndpointId : The ID of the Resolver  endpoint  that
                   the Resolver rule is associated with.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can  filter  on the Resolver endpoint only for rules
                     that have a value of FORWARD for RuleType .

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver rule.  If  you  specify
                   Status for Name , specify one of the following status codes
                   for Values : COMPLETE , DELETING , UPDATING , or FAILED .

                 o Type : The type of the Resolver rule. If you  specify  TYPE
                   for Name , specify FORWARD or SYSTEM for Values .

              Values -> (list)
                 When you're using a List operation and you want the operation
                 to return a subset of objects, such as Resolver endpoints  or
                 Resolver  rules,  the value of the parameter that you want to
                 use to filter objects. For  example,  to  list  only  inbound
                 Resolver  endpoints,  specify  Direction for Name and specify
                 INBOUND for Values .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If more than MaxResults rule associations match the specified crite-
          ria,  you  can submit another ListResolverRuleAssociation request to
          get the next group of results. In  the  next  request,  specify  the
          value of NextToken from the previous response.

       MaxResults -> (integer)
          The value that you specified for MaxResults in the request.

       ResolverRuleAssociations -> (list)
          The  associations  that were created between Resolver rules and VPCs
          using the current Amazon Web Services account, and  that  match  the
          specified filters, if any.

          (structure)
              In     the    response    to    an    AssociateResolverRule    ,
              DisassociateResolverRule   ,   or   ListResolverRuleAssociations
              request,  provides  information  about  an association between a
              Resolver rule and a VPC. The association  determines  which  DNS
              queries that originate in the VPC are forwarded to your network.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the association between a Resolver rule and a  VPC.
                 Resolver    assigns   this   value   when   you   submit   an
                 AssociateResolverRule request.

              ResolverRuleId -> (string)
