DELETE-RESOLVER-ENDPOINT()                          DELETE-RESOLVER-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       delete-resolver-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a Resolver endpoint. The effect of deleting a Resolver endpoint
       depends on whether it's an inbound or an outbound Resolver endpoint:

       o Inbound : DNS queries from your network are no longer routed  to  the
         DNS service for the specified VPC.

       o Outbound  :  DNS queries from a VPC are no longer routed to your net-
         work.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-resolver-endpoint
          --resolver-endpoint-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver endpoint that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a Resolver endpoint

       The following delete-resolver-endpoint example  deletes  the  specified
       endpoint.

       Important If you delete an inbound endpoint, DNS queries from your net-
       work are no longer forwarded to Resolver in the VPC that you  specified
       in  the  endpoint.  If  you delete an outbound endpoint, Resolver stops
       forwarding DNS queries from your VPC to your  network  for  rules  that
       specify the deleted outbound endpoint.

          aws route53resolver delete-resolver-endpoint \
              --resolver-endpoint-id rslvr-in-497098ad59example

OUTPUT
       ResolverEndpoint -> (structure)
          Information  about the DeleteResolverEndpoint request, including the
          status of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies the  request  that  created  the
              Resolver  endpoint.  The CreatorRequestId allows failed requests
              to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver endpoint.

          Name -> (string)
              The name that you assigned to the  Resolver  endpoint  when  you
              submitted a CreateResolverEndpoint request.

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The  ID  of  one  or more security groups that control access to
              this VPC. The security group must include one  or  more  inbound
              rules  (for  inbound  endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound
              endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow  TCP  and  UDP
              access.  For  inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access,
              open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

              (string)

          Direction -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  the Resolver endpoint allows inbound or out-
              bound DNS queries:

              o INBOUND : allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network

              o OUTBOUND : allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network

          IpAddressCount -> (integer)
              The number of IP addresses that the Resolver  endpoint  can  use
              for DNS queries.

          HostVPCId -> (string)
              The  ID of the VPC that you want to create the Resolver endpoint
              in.

          Status -> (string)
              A code that specifies the current status of  the  Resolver  end-
              point. Valid values include the following:

              o CREATING  :  Resolver  is creating and configuring one or more
                Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.

              o OPERATIONAL : The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this  end-
                point  are  correctly  configured  and able to pass inbound or
                outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.

              o UPDATING : Resolver is associating or  disassociating  one  or
                more network interfaces with this endpoint.

              o AUTO_RECOVERING : Resolver is trying to recover one or more of
                the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint.
                During  the recovery process, the endpoint functions with lim-
                ited capacity because of  the  limit  on  the  number  of  DNS
                queries  per  IP address (per network interface). For the cur-
                rent limit, see Limits on Route 53 Resolver .

              o ACTION_NEEDED : This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't
                automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend
                that you check each IP address that you  associated  with  the
                endpoint.  For  each  IP  address  that  isn't  available, add
                another IP address and then delete the IP address  that  isn't
                available.  (An  endpoint  must always include at least two IP
                addresses.) A status of ACTION_NEEDED can have  a  variety  of
                causes. Here are two common causes:

                o One  or  more  of the network interfaces that are associated
                  with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.

                o The network interface couldn't be created  for  some  reason
                  that's outside the control of Resolver.

              o DELETING  : Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the associ-
                ated network interfaces.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the endpoint was created,  in  Unix  time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and time that the endpoint was last modified, in Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
