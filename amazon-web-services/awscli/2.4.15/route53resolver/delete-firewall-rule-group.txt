DELETE-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP()                      DELETE-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP()



NAME
       delete-firewall-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified firewall rule group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-firewall-rule-group
          --firewall-rule-group-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of the firewall rule group that you want to
          delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FirewallRuleGroup -> (structure)
          A collection of rules used to filter DNS network traffic.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the rule group.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the rule group.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the rule group.

          RuleCount -> (integer)
              The number of rules in the rule group.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the domain list.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Additional information about the status of the  rule  group,  if
              available.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that created
              the rule group. When a rule group is shared with  your  account,

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A  unique  string  defined  by you to identify the request. This
              allows you to retry failed requests without the risk of  running

              a timestamp.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              Whether the rule group is shared with other Amazon Web  Services
              accounts, or was shared with the current account by another Ama-
              zon Web Services account. Sharing is configured through Resource
              Access Manager (RAM).

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date and time that the rule group was created, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the rule group was last modified, in Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
