LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUPS()                        LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-firewall-rule-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  minimal high-level information for the rule groups that
       you have defined.

       A single call might return only a partial list of the rule groups.  For
       information, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewall-rule-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: FirewallRuleGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewall-rule-groups
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of your Firewall rule groups

       The following list-firewall-rule-groups example lists your DNS Firewall
       rule groups.

          aws route53resolver list-firewall-rule-groups

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRuleGroups": [
                  {
                      "Id": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-rule-group/rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                      "Name": "test",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "CreatorRequestId": "my-request-id",
                      "ShareStatus": "NOT_SHARED"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Managing rule groups and rules in  DNS  Fire-
       wall in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this
          token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of  objects,  pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       FirewallRuleGroups -> (list)
          A list of your firewall rule groups.

          This  might  be  a  partial  list  of  the rule groups that you have
          defined. For information, see MaxResults .

          (structure)
              Minimal high-level information for a firewall  rule  group.  The
              action    ListFirewallRuleGroups   returns  an  array  of  these
              objects.

              To retrieve full information for a  firewall  rule  group,  call
              GetFirewallRuleGroup and  ListFirewallRules .

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the rule group.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the rule group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule group.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that cre-
                 ated the rule group. When a rule group is  shared  with  your
                 account,  this  is the account that has shared the rule group
                 with you.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string defined by you to identify the request.  This
                 allows  you to retry failed requests without the risk of run-
                 ning the operation twice. This can be any unique string,  for
                 example, a timestamp.

              ShareStatus -> (string)
                 Whether  the  rule group is shared with other Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices accounts, or was shared with  the  current  account  by
                 another  Amazon  Web  Services account. Sharing is configured
                 through Resource Access Manager (RAM).
