NAME
       get-resolver-query-log-config-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a specified association between a Resolver query
       logging configuration and an Amazon VPC. When you associate a VPC  with
       a query logging configuration, Resolver logs DNS queries that originate
       in that VPC.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resolver-query-log-config-association
          --resolver-query-log-config-association-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-query-log-config-association-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver query logging configuration association  that
          you want to get information about.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociation -> (structure)
          Information  about the Resolver query logging configuration associa-
          tion that you specified in a GetQueryLogConfigAssociation request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the query logging association.

          ResolverQueryLogConfigId -> (string)
              The ID of the query logging configuration that a VPC is  associ-
              ated with.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The  ID of the Amazon VPC that is associated with the query log-
              ging configuration.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the specified  query  logging  association.  Valid
              values include the following:

              o CREATING : Resolver is creating an association between an Ama-
                zon VPC and a query logging configuration.

              o CREATED : The association between an Amazon VPC  and  a  query
                logging  configuration  was  successfully created. Resolver is
                logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this  query  logging  associa-
                tion.

              o FAILED  :  Resolver  either couldn't create or couldn't delete
                the query logging association.

          Error -> (string)
              If the value of Status is FAILED , the value of Error  indicates
              the cause:

              o DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND  :  The specified destination (for exam-
                ple, an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted.

              o ACCESS_DENIED : Permissions don't allow sending  logs  to  the
                destination.

              If  the  value of Status is a value other than FAILED , Error is
              null.

          ErrorMessage -> (string)
              Contains additional information about the error. If the value or
              Error is null, the value of ErrorMessage also is null.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time  that the VPC was associated with the query
              logging configuration, in Unix time format and Coordinated  Uni-
              versal Time (UTC).
