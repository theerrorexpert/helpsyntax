CREATE-TIMELINE-EVENT()                                CREATE-TIMELINE-EVENT()



NAME
       create-timeline-event -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  custom  timeline  event  on the incident details page of an
       incident record. Timeline events are automatically created by  Incident
       Manager,  marking  key moment during an incident. You can create custom
       timeline  events  to  mark  important  events  that  are  automatically
       detected by Incident Manager.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-timeline-event
          [--client-token <value>]
          --event-data <value>
          --event-time <value>
          --event-type <value>
          --incident-record-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the action is called only once with the speci-
          fied details.

       --event-data (string)
          A short description of the event as a valid JSON string. There is no
          other schema imposed.

       --event-time (timestamp)
          The time that the event occurred.

       --event-type (string)
          The type of the event. You can create timeline events of type Custom
          Event .

       --incident-record-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the incident record to  which  the
          event will be added.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              --event-time 2020-10-01T20:30:00.000 \
              --event-type "Custom Event" \
              --incident-record-arn "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/Example-Response-Plan/6ebcc812-85f5-b7eb-8b2f-283e4d844308"

              "incidentRecordArn": "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/Example-Response-Plan/6ebcc812-85f5-b7eb-8b2f-283e4d844308"
          }
