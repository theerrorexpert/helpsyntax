       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-incident
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--impact <value>]
          [--related-items <value>]
          --response-plan-arn <value>
          [--title <value>]
          [--trigger-details <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the operation is called  only  once  with  the
          specified details.

       --impact (integer)
          Defines  the impact to the customers. Providing an impact overwrites
          the impact provided by a response plan.
              Possible impacts:

          o 1 - Critical impact, this typically relates  to  full  application
            failure that impacts many to all customers.

          o 2  -  High impact, partial application failure with impact to many
            customers.

          o 3 - Medium impact, the application is providing reduced service to
            customers.

          o 4 - Low impact, customer might aren't impacted by the problem yet.

          o 5 - No impact, customers  aren't  currently  impacted  but  urgent
            action is needed to avoid impact.

       --related-items (list)
          Add  related  items  to  the  incident  for other responders to use.
          Related items are AWS resources, external links, or  files  uploaded
          to an Amazon S3 bucket.

          (structure)
              Resources  that  responders use to triage and mitigate the inci-
              dent.

              identifier -> (structure)

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of related item. Incident Manager  supports  the

                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the related item, if
                        the related item is an Amazon resource.

                     metricDefinition -> (string)
                        The metric definition, if the related item is a metric
                        in Amazon CloudWatch.

                     url -> (string)
                        The  URL, if the related item is a non-Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices resource.

                 The title of the related item.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          identifier={type=string,value={arn=string,metricDefinition=string,url=string}},title=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "identifier": {
                "type": "ANALYSIS"|"INCIDENT"|"METRIC"|"PARENT"|"ATTACHMENT"|"OTHER",
                "value": {
                  "arn": "string",
                  "metricDefinition": "string",
                  "url": "string"
                }
              },
              "title": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --response-plan-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the response plan that pre-defines
          summary,  chat  channels,  Amazon  SNS  topics, runbooks, title, and
          impact of the incident.

       --title (string)
          Provide a title for the incident. Providing a title  overwrites  the
          title provided by the response plan.

       --trigger-details (structure)
          Details of what created the incident record in Incident Manager.

          rawData -> (string)
              Raw  data  passed  from either Amazon EventBridge, Amazon Cloud-
              Watch, or Incident Manager when an incident is created.

          source -> (string)
              Identifies the  service  that  sourced  the  event.  All  events
              sourced  from within Amazon Web Services begin with "aws. " Cus-
              tomer-generated events can have any value here, as  long  as  it
              doesn't  begin  with  "aws. " We recommend the use of Java pack-
              age-name style reverse domain-name strings.

          timestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time that the incident was detected.

          triggerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source that  detected  the
              incident.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          rawData=string,source=string,timestamp=timestamp,triggerArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "rawData": "string",
            "source": "string",
            "timestamp": timestamp,
            "triggerArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start an incident

       The following start-incident example starts an incident using the spec-
       ified response plan.

          aws ssm-incidents start-incident \
              --response-plan-arn "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:response-plan/Example-Response-Plan"

       Output:

          {
              "incidentRecordArn": "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::682428703967:incident-record/Example-Response-Plan/6ebcc812-85f5-b7eb-8b2f-283e4d844308"
          }

       For more information, see Incident creation  in  the  Incident  Manager
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       incidentRecordArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the newly created incident record.
