OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the incident record you are updat-
          ing.

       --chat-channel (structure)
          The Chatbot chat channel where responders can collaborate.

          chatbotSns -> (list)
              The  Amazon  SNS  targets  that  Chatbot uses to notify the chat
              channel of updates to an incident. You can also make updates  to
              the  incident  through  the chat channel by using the Amazon SNS
              topics.

              (string)

          empty -> (structure)
              Used to remove the chat  channel  from  an  incident  record  or
              response plan.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          chatbotSns=string,string,empty={}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "chatbotSns": ["string", ...],
            "empty": {

            }
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A token that ensures that the operation is called only once with the
          specified details.

       --impact (integer)
          Defines the impact of the incident to  customers  and  applications.
          Providing  an  impact overwrites the impact provided by the response
          plan.
              Possible impacts:

          o 1 - Critical impact, full application failure that impacts many to
            all customers.

            customers.

          o 3 - Medium impact, the application is providing reduced service to
            customers.

          o 4 - Low impact, customer aren't impacted by the problem yet.

          o 5  -  No  impact,  customers  aren't currently impacted but urgent
            action is needed to avoid impact.

       --notification-targets (list)
          The Amazon SNS targets that are notified when updates are made to an
          incident.

          Using  multiple  SNS  topics  creates redundancy in the event that a
          Region is down during the incident.

              The SNS targets that are notified when updates are  made  to  an

       Shorthand Syntax:

          snsTopicArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "snsTopicArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --status (string)
          The status of the incident. An incident can be Open or Resolved .

       --title (string)
          A brief description of the incident.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
