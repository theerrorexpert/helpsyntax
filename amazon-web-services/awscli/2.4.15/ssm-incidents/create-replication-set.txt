CREATE-REPLICATION-SET()                              CREATE-REPLICATION-SET()



NAME
       create-replication-set -

DESCRIPTION
       A  replication  set  replicates  and encrypts your data to the provided
       Regions with the provided KMS key.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-replication-set
          [--client-token <value>]
          --regions <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the operation is called  only  once  with  the
          specified details.

       --regions (map)
          The  Regions  that Incident Manager replicates your data to. You can
          have up to three Regions in your replication set.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The mapping between a Amazon Web Services  Region  and  the  key
              that's used to encrypt the data.

              sseKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The KMS key used to encrypt the data in your replication set.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=sseKmsKeyId=string,KeyName2=sseKmsKeyId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "sseKmsKeyId": "string"
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create the replication set

       The following create-replication-set example  creates  the  replication
       set  Incident Manager uses to replicate and encrypt data in your Amazon
       Web Services account. This example uses  the  us-east-1  and  us-east-2
       Regions while creating the replication set.

          aws ssm-incidents create-replication-set \
              --regions '{"us-east-1": {"sseKmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"}, "us-east-2": {"sseKmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"}}'

       Output:

          {
              "replicationSetArns": [
                  "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:replication-set/c4bcb603-4bf9-bb3f-413c-08df53673b57"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Using the Incident Manager replication set in
       the Incident Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication set.
