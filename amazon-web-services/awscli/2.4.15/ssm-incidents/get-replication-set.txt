GET-REPLICATION-SET()                                    GET-REPLICATION-SET()



NAME
       get-replication-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve your Incident Manager replication set.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-replication-set
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the replication set you want to
          retrieve.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the replication set

       The following get-replication-set  example  gets  the  details  of  the
       replication  set Incident Manager uses to replicate and encrypt data in
       your Amazon Web Services account.

          aws ssm-incidents get-replication-set \
              --arn "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:replication-set/c4bcb603-4bf9-bb3f-413c-08df53673b57"

       Output:

          {
              "replicationSet": {
                  "createdBy": "arn:aws:sts::111122223333:assumed-role/Admin/username",
                  "createdTime": "2021-05-14T17:57:22.010000+00:00",
                  "deletionProtected": false,
                  "lastModifiedBy": "arn:aws:sts::111122223333:assumed-role/Admin/username",
                  "lastModifiedTime": "2021-05-14T17:57:22.010000+00:00",
                  "regionMap": {
                      "us-east-1": {
                          "sseKmsKeyId": "DefaultKey",
                          "status": "ACTIVE"
                      },
                      "us-east-2": {
                          "sseKmsKeyId": "DefaultKey",
                          "status": "ACTIVE",
                          "statusMessage": "Tagging inaccessible"
                      }
                  },
                  "status": "ACTIVE"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       replicationSet -> (structure)
          Details of the replication set.

          arn -> (string)

              When the replication set was created.

          deletionProtected -> (boolean)
              Determines if the replication set deletion protection is enabled
              or not. If deletion protection is enabled, you can't delete  the
              last Amazon Web Services Region in the replication set.

          lastModifiedBy -> (string)
              Who last modified the replication set.

          lastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              When the replication set was last updated.

          regionMap -> (map)
              The map between each Amazon Web Services Region in your replica-
              tion set and the KMS key that's used to encrypt the data in that
              Region.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Information about a Amazon Web Services Region in your repli-
                 cation set.

                 sseKmsKeyId -> (string)
                     The ID of the KMS key used to encrypt the  data  in  this
                     Amazon Web Services Region.

                     The  status  of  the  Amazon  Web  Services Region in the
                     replication set.

                 statusMessage -> (string)
                     Information displayed about the status of the Amazon  Web
                     Services Region.
