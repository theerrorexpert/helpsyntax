SYNOPSIS
            batch-snooze-alarm
          --snooze-action-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snooze-action-requests (list)
          The list of snooze  action  requests.  You  can  specify  up  to  10
          requests per operation.

          (structure)
              Information needed to snooze the alarm.

              requestId -> (string)
                 The request ID. Each ID must be unique within each batch.

              alarmModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the alarm model.

              keyValue -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the  key  used as a filter to select only the
                 alarms associated with the key .

              note -> (string)
                 The note that you can leave when you snooze the alarm.

              snoozeDuration -> (integer)
                 The snooze time in seconds. The alarm  automatically  changes
                 to the NORMAL state after this duration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          requestId=string,alarmModelName=string,keyValue=string,note=string,snoozeDuration=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "requestId": "string",
              "alarmModelName": "string",
              "keyValue": "string",
              "note": "string",
              "snoozeDuration": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       errorEntries -> (list)
          A  list  of errors associated with the request, or null if there are
          no errors. Each error entry contains an  entry  ID  that  helps  you
          identify the entry that failed.

          (structure)
              Contains  error  messages  associated  with one of the following
              requests:

              o BatchAcknowledgeAlarm

              o BatchDisableAlarm

              o BatchEnableAlarm

              o BatchResetAlarm

              o BatchSnoozeAlarm

              requestId -> (string)
                 The request ID. Each ID must be unique within each batch.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 A message that describes the error.
