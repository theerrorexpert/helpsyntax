SYNOPSIS
            batch-acknowledge-alarm
          --acknowledge-action-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --acknowledge-action-requests (list)
          The list of acknowledge action requests. You can specify  up  to  10
          requests per operation.

          (structure)
              Information needed to acknowledge the alarm.

              requestId -> (string)
                 The request ID. Each ID must be unique within each batch.

              alarmModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the alarm model.

              keyValue -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the  key  used as a filter to select only the
                 alarms associated with the key .

              note -> (string)
                 The note that you can leave when you acknowledge the alarm.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          requestId=string,alarmModelName=string,keyValue=string,note=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "requestId": "string",
              "alarmModelName": "string",
              "keyValue": "string",
              "note": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       errorEntries -> (list)
          A list of errors associated with the request, or null if  there  are
          no  errors.  Each  error  entry  contains an entry ID that helps you
          identify the entry that failed.

          (structure)
              Contains error messages associated with  one  of  the  following
              requests:

              o BatchAcknowledgeAlarm

              o BatchDisableAlarm

              o BatchEnableAlarm

              o BatchResetAlarm

              o BatchSnoozeAlarm

              requestId -> (string)
                 The request ID. Each ID must be unique within each batch.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 A message that describes the error.
