SYNOPSIS
            list-text-translation-jobs
          [--filter <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          The   parameters  that  specify  which  batch  translation  jobs  to
          retrieve. Filters include job name, job status, and submission time.
          You can only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters the list of jobs by name.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters the list of jobs based by job status.

          SubmittedBeforeTime -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing and returns only the jobs submitted before
              the specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest
              to newest.

          SubmittedAfterTime -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for processing and returns only the jobs submitted after
              the specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order,  new-
              est to oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmittedBeforeTime=timestamp,SubmittedAfterTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"COMPLETED_WITH_ERROR"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmittedBeforeTime": timestamp,
            "SubmittedAfterTime": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to return in each page. The default
          value is 100.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 ContentType -> (string)
                     Describes  the format of the data that you submit to Ama-
                     zon Translate as input. You can specify one of  the  fol-
                     lowing multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

                     o text/html : The input data consists of one or more HTML
                       files.  Amazon  Translate translates only the text that
                       resides in the html element in each file.

                     o text/plain : The input data consists  of  one  or  more
                       unformatted  text  files.  Amazon  Translate translates
                       every character in this type of input.

                     o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordpro-
                       cessingml.document  : The input data consists of one or
                       more Word documents (.docx).

                     o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presenta-
                       tionml.presentation : The input data consists of one or
                       more PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).

                     o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spread-
                       sheetml.sheet  : The input data consists of one or more
                       Excel Workbook files (.xlsx).

                       one  or  more  XML Localization Interchange File Format
                       (XLIFF) files (.xlf). Amazon  Translate  supports  only

                     WARNING:
                        If  you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that
                        you set this parameter to text/html . By doing so, you
                        cut  costs by limiting the translation to the contents
                        of the html element in each file.  Otherwise,  if  you
                        set  this  parameter  to  text/plain , your costs will
                        cover the translation of every character.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output configuration properties that were specified  when
                 the job was requested.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  URI  of  the  S3  folder that contains a translation
                     job's output file. The folder must be in the same  Region
                     as the API endpoint that you are calling.

                 EncryptionKey -> (structure)

                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  encryption  key

                     to mask profane words and  phrases  in  your  translation
                     output.

                     To  mask  profane  words  and  phrases,  Amazon Translate
                     replaces them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-char-
                     acter  sequence  is used for each profane word or phrase,
                     regardless of the length or number of words.

                     Amazon Translate does not detect profanity in all of  its
                     supported languages. For languages that support profanity
                     detection, see Supported Languages and Language Codes  in
                     the Amazon Translate Developer Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
