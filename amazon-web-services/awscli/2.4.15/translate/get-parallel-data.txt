GET-PARALLEL-DATA()                                        GET-PARALLEL-DATA()



NAME
       get-parallel-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about a parallel data resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-parallel-data
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the parallel data resource that is being retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          WARNING:
              Amazon  Translate  doesn't  scan all input files for the risk of
              CSV injection attacks.

              CSV injection occurs when a .csv or .tsv file is altered so that
              a  record contains malicious code. The record begins with a spe-
              cial character, such as =, +, -, or @. When the file  is  opened
              in a spreadsheet program, the program might interpret the record
              as a formula and run the code within it.

              Before you download an input file from Amazon  S3,  ensure  that
              you recognize the file and trust its creator.

          RepositoryType -> (string)
              Describes  the  repository that contains the parallel data input
              file.

          Location -> (string)
