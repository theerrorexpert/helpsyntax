LIST-PARALLEL-DATA()                                      LIST-PARALLEL-DATA()



NAME
       list-parallel-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a list of your parallel data resources in Amazon Translate.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-parallel-data
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A string that specifies the next page of results to return in a pag-
          inated response.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of parallel  data  resources  returned  for  each
          request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of the parallel data resource. When the parallel

              SourceLanguageCode -> (string)
                 The source language of the translations in the parallel  data
                 file.

                 The  language codes for the target languages available in the
                 parallel  data  file.  All  possible  target  languages   are
                 returned as an array.

                 (string)

              ParallelDataConfig -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  format  and  S3 location of the parallel data
                 input file.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The URI of the Amazon S3 folder that contains the  paral-
                     lel  data  input  file.  The  folder  must be in the same
                     Region as the API endpoint you are calling.

                 Format -> (string)
                     The format of the parallel data input file.

              Message -> (string)

                 The number of UTF-8 characters that Amazon Translate imported
                 from the parallel data input file. This number includes  only
                 the  characters  in  your  translation  examples. It does not
                 include characters that are used to  format  your  file.  For

                 lel data input file.

              SkippedRecordCount -> (long)
                 The number of items in the input file that  Amazon  Translate
                 skipped  when  you  created  or  updated  the  parallel  data

                     The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  encryption  key
                     being used to encrypt this object.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the parallel data resource was created.

              LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
