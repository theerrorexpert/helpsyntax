NAME
       describe-text-translation-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  properties associated with an asynchronous batch translation
       job including name, ID, status, source and target languages, input/out-
       put S3 buckets, and so on.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-text-translation-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  identifier  that  Amazon  Translate  generated for the job. The
          StartTextTranslationJob operation returns  this  identifier  in  its
          response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The folder must be in the same Region as the API endpoint you
                 are calling.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 Describes the format of the data that you  submit  to  Amazon
                 Translate as input. You can specify one of the following mul-
                 tipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

                 o text/html : The input data consists of  one  or  more  HTML
                   files.  Amazon  Translate  translates  only  the  text that
                   resides in the html element in each file.

                 o text/plain : The input data consists of one or more  unfor-
                   matted  text files. Amazon Translate translates every char-
                   acter in this type of input.

                 o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocess-
                   ingml.document  :  The  input  data consists of one or more
                   Word documents (.docx).

                 o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presenta-
                   tionml.presentation  :  The  input  data consists of one or
                   more PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).

                 o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spread-
                   sheetml.sheet  :  The  input  data  consists of one or more
                   Excel Workbook files (.xlsx).

                 o application/x-xliff+xml : The input data consists of one or
                   more XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF) files
                   (.xlf). Amazon Translate supports only XLIFF version 1.2.

                 WARNING:
                     If you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that you
                     set  this  parameter  to text/html . By doing so, you cut
                     costs by limiting the translation to the contents of  the
                     html  element  in  each  file. Otherwise, if you set this
                     parameter to text/plain  ,  your  costs  will  cover  the
                     translation of every character.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output configuration properties that were specified when the
              job was requested.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The URI of the S3 folder that contains  a  translation  job's
                 output file. The folder must be in the same Region as the API
                 endpoint that you are calling.

              EncryptionKey -> (structure)
                 The encryption key used to encrypt this object.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of encryption key used by  Amazon  Translate  to
                     encrypt this object.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the encryption key
                     being used to encrypt this object.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an  AWS  Identity  Access  and
              Management  (IAM) role that granted Amazon Translate read access
              to the job's input data.

          Settings -> (structure)
              Settings that configure the translation output.

              Profanity -> (string)
                 Enable the profanity setting if you want Amazon Translate  to
                 mask profane words and phrases in your translation output.

                 To  mask profane words and phrases, Amazon Translate replaces
                 them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-character sequence
                 is  used  for  each profane word or phrase, regardless of the
                 length or number of words.

                 Amazon Translate does not detect profanity in all of its sup-
                 ported languages. For languages that support profanity detec-
                 tion, see Supported Languages and Language Codes in the  Ama-
                 zon Translate Developer Guide .
