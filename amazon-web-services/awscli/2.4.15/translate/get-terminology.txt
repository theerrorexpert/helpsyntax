GET-TERMINOLOGY()                                            GET-TERMINOLOGY()



NAME
       get-terminology -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a custom terminology.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-terminology
          --name <value>
          [--terminology-data-format <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the custom terminology being retrieved.

       --terminology-data-format (string)
          The data format of the custom terminology being retrieved.

          If you don't specify this parameter, Amazon Translate returns a file
          that has the same format as the file that was imported to create the
          terminology.

          If  you specify this parameter when you retrieve a multi-directional
          terminology resource, you must specify the same format  as  that  of
          the  input  file  that  was imported to create it. Otherwise, Amazon
          Translate throws an error.

          Possible values:

          o CSV

          o TMX

          o TSV

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)

          WARNING:
              Amazon  Translate  doesn't  scan all input files for the risk of
              CSV injection attacks.

              CSV injection occurs when a .csv or .tsv file is altered so that
              a  record contains malicious code. The record begins with a spe-
              cial character, such as =, +, -, or @. When the file  is  opened
              in a spreadsheet program, the program might interpret the record
              as a formula and run the code within it.

              Before you download an input file from Amazon  S3,  ensure  that
              you recognize the file and trust its creator.

          RepositoryType -> (string)
              The repository type for the custom terminology data.

          Location -> (string)
              The  Amazon  S3  location  of the most recent custom terminology
              input file that was successfully imported into Amazon Translate.
              The location is returned as a presigned URL that has a 30 minute
              expiration.

       AuxiliaryDataLocation -> (structure)
          The Amazon S3 location of a file that provides any errors  or  warn-
          ings  that  were  produced by your input file. This file was created
