STOP-TEXT-TRANSLATION-JOB()                        STOP-TEXT-TRANSLATION-JOB()



NAME
       stop-text-translation-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops an asynchronous batch translation job that is in progress.

       If the job's state is IN_PROGRESS , the job will be marked for termina-
       tion and put into the STOP_REQUESTED state. If the job completes before
       it  can  be stopped, it is put into the COMPLETED state. Otherwise, the
       job is put into the STOPPED state.

       Asynchronous batch translation jobs are started  with  the   StartText-
       TranslationJob  operation.  You can use the  DescribeTextTranslationJob
       or  ListTextTranslationJobs operations to get a batch translation job's
       JobId .

SYNOPSIS
            stop-text-translation-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The job ID of the job to be stopped.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The job ID of the stopped batch translation job.

       JobStatus -> (string)
          The  status  of  the designated job. Upon successful completion, the
          job's status will be STOPPED .
