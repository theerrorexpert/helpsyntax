SYNOPSIS
            translate-text
          --text <value>
          [--terminology-names <value>]
          --source-language-code <value>
          --target-language-code <value>
          [--settings <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          The  text  to  translate.  The text string can be a maximum of 5,000
          bytes long. Depending on your character set, this may be fewer  than
          5,000 characters.

       --terminology-names (list)
          The  name  of the terminology list file to be used in the Translate-
          Text request. You can use 1 terminology list at most in a Translate-
          Text  request. Terminology lists can contain a maximum of 256 terms.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-language-code (string)
          The language code for the language of the source text. The  language
          must be a language supported by Amazon Translate. For a list of lan-
          guage codes, see  what-is-languages .

          To have Amazon Translate determine the source language of your text,
          you can specify auto in the SourceLanguageCode field. If you specify
          auto , Amazon Translate will call Amazon Comprehend to determine the
          source language.

       --target-language-code (string)
          The language code requested for the language of the target text. The
          language must be a language supported by Amazon Translate.

       --settings (structure)
          Settings to configure your translation output, including the  option
          to mask profane words and phrases.

          Profanity -> (string)
              Enable  the  profanity  setting  if you want Amazon Translate to
              mask profane words and phrases in your translation output.

              To mask profane words and  phrases,  Amazon  Translate  replaces
              them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-character sequence is
              used for each profane word or phrase, regardless of  the  length
              or number of words.

              Amazon  Translate  does  not detect profanity in all of its sup-
              ported languages. For languages that  support  profanity  detec-
              tion,  see  Supported Languages and Language Codes in the Amazon
              Translate Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Profanity=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Profanity": "MASK"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              used  for  each profane word or phrase, regardless of the length
              or number of words.

              Amazon Translate does not detect profanity in all  of  its  sup-
              ported  languages.  For  languages that support profanity detec-
              tion, see Supported Languages and Language Codes in  the  Amazon
