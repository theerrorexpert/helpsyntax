START-TEXT-TRANSLATION-JOB()                      START-TEXT-TRANSLATION-JOB()



NAME
       start-text-translation-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  asynchronous  batch translation job. Batch translation jobs
       can be used to translate large volumes of text  across  multiple  docu-
       ments at once. For more information, see  async .

       Batch  translation jobs can be described with the  DescribeTextTransla-
       tionJob operation, listed with the  ListTextTranslationJobs  operation,
       and stopped with the  StopTextTranslationJob operation.

       NOTE:
          Amazon  Translate  does  not  support  batch translation of multiple
          source languages at once.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The name of the batch translation job to be performed.

       --input-data-config (structure)
          Specifies the format and S3 location of the input documents for  the
          translation job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The  URI  of the AWS S3 folder that contains the input file. The
              folder must be in the same Region as the API  endpoint  you  are
              calling.

          ContentType -> (string)
              Describes  the  format  of  the  data  that you submit to Amazon
              Translate as input. You can specify one of the following  multi-
              purpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

              o text/html : The input data consists of one or more HTML files.
                Amazon Translate translates only the text that resides in  the
                html element in each file.

              o text/plain  : The input data consists of one or more unformat-
                ted text files. Amazon Translate translates every character in
                this type of input.

              o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocess-
                ingml.document : The input data consists of one or  more  Word
                documents (.docx).

              o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presenta-
                tionml.presentation : The input data consists of one  or  more
                PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).

              o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spread-
                sheetml.sheet : The input data consists of one or  more  Excel
                Workbook files (.xlsx).

              o application/x-xliff+xml  :  The  input data consists of one or
                more XML Localization Interchange File  Format  (XLIFF)  files
                (.xlf). Amazon Translate supports only XLIFF version 1.2.

              WARNING:
                 If you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that you set
                 this parameter to text/html . By doing so, you cut  costs  by
                 limiting  the translation to the contents of the html element
                 in each  file.  Otherwise,  if  you  set  this  parameter  to
                 text/plain  ,  your costs will cover the translation of every
                 character.

              The URI of the S3 folder that contains a translation job's  out-
              put  file. The folder must be in the same Region as the API end-
              point that you are calling.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string",
            "EncryptionKey": {
              "Type": "KMS",
              "Id": "string"
            }
          }

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity Access and Manage-

          ment .

       --source-language-code (string)
          The  language  code  of  the  input language. For a list of language
          codes, see  what-is-languages .

          Amazon Translate does not automatically  detect  a  source  language
          during batch translation jobs.

       --target-language-codes (list)
          The language code of the output language.

          (string)

       --terminology-names (list)
          The  name of a custom terminology resource to add to the translation
          job. This resource lists  examples  source  terms  and  the  desired
          translation for each term.

          This parameter accepts only one custom terminology resource.

          For a list of available custom terminology resources, use the  List-
          Terminologies operation.

          For more information, see  how-custom-terminology .

          (string)

          "string" "string" ...

       --parallel-data-names (list)
          The name of a parallel data resource to add to the translation  job.
          This  resource  consists of examples that show how you want segments
          of text to be translated. When you add parallel data to  a  transla-
          tion job, you create an Active Custom Translation job.

          This parameter accepts only one parallel data resource.

          NOTE:
              Active  Custom Translation jobs are priced at a higher rate than
              other jobs that don't use parallel data. For  more  information,
              see Amazon Translate pricing .

          For a list of available parallel data resources, use the  ListParal-
          lelData operation.

          For more information, see  customizing-translations-parallel-data  .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-token (string)

          when using the Amazon Translate SDK.

       --settings (structure)
          Settings to configure your translation output, including the  option
          to mask profane words and phrases.

          Profanity -> (string)
              Enable  the  profanity  setting  if you want Amazon Translate to
              mask profane words and phrases in your translation output.

              To mask profane words and  phrases,  Amazon  Translate  replaces
              them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-character sequence is
              used for each profane word or phrase, regardless of  the  length
              or number of words.

              Amazon  Translate  does  not detect profanity in all of its sup-
              ported languages. For languages that  support  profanity  detec-
              tion,  see  Supported Languages and Language Codes in the Amazon
              Translate Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Profanity=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Profanity": "MASK"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
