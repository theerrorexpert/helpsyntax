       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            ungroup-resources
          --group <value>
          --resource-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group (string)
          The  name  or the ARN of the resource group from which to remove the
          resources.

       --resource-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the resources to be removed from the group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Succeeded -> (list)
          A list of resources that were successfully removed from the group by
          this operation.

          (string)

       Failed -> (list)
          A  list of any resources that failed to be removed from the group by
          this operation.

          (structure)
              A resource that failed to be added to or removed from a group.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource that failed to be added or removed.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message text associated with the failure.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code associated with the failure.

       Pending -> (list)
          A list of any resources that are  still  in  the  process  of  being
          removed  from  the  group  by this operation. These pending removals
          continue  asynchronously.  You  can  check  the  status  of  pending
          removals by using the ``  ListGroupResources `` operation. After the
          resource is successfully  removed,  it  no  longer  appears  in  the
          response.

          (structure)
              A structure that identifies a resource that is currently pending
              addition to the group as  a  member.  Adding  a  resource  to  a
              resource  group  happens asynchronously as a background task and
              this one isn't completed yet.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the resource  that's  in  a
                 pending state.
