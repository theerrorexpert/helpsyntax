       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            group-resources
          --group <value>
          --resource-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group (string)
          The name or the ARN of the resource group to add resources to.

       --resource-arns (list)
          The list of ARNs for resources to be added to the group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Succeeded -> (list)
          A  list  of  ARNs  of  resources that were successfully added to the
          group by this operation.

          (string)

       Failed -> (list)
          A list of ARNs of any resources that failed to be added to the group
          by this operation.

          (structure)
              A resource that failed to be added to or removed from a group.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource that failed to be added or removed.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message text associated with the failure.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code associated with the failure.

       Pending -> (list)
          A  list  of  ARNs  of any resources that are still in the process of
          being added to the group by this operation. These pending  additions
          continue  asynchronously.  You can check the status of pending addi-
          tions by using the ``  ListGroupResources `` operation, and checking
          the  Resources  array  in  the response and the Status field of each
          object in that array.

          (structure)
              A structure that identifies a resource that is currently pending
              addition  to  the  group  as  a  member.  Adding a resource to a
              resource group happens asynchronously as a background  task  and
              this one isn't completed yet.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  resource  name (ARN) of the resource that's in a
                 pending state.
