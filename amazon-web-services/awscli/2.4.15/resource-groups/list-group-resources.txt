NAME
       list-group-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of ARNs of the resources that are members of a specified
       resource group.
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

       o resource-groups:ListGroupResources

       o cloudformation:DescribeStacks

       o cloudformation:ListStackResources

       o tag:GetResources

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-group-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ResourceIdentifiers, Resources

SYNOPSIS
            list-group-resources
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)

          WARNING:

              o Deprecated  -  don't  use  this  parameter.  Use the ``Group``
                request field instead. *

       --group (string)
          The name or the ARN of the resource group

       --filters (list)
          Filters, formatted as  ResourceFilter  objects,  that  you  want  to
          apply  to  a  ListGroupResources  operation.  Filters the results to
          include only those of the specified resource types.

          o resource-type - Filter resources by their type. Specify up to five
            resource  types in the format AWS::ServiceCode::ResourceType . For
            example, AWS::EC2::Instance , or AWS::S3::Bucket .

          When you specify a resource-type filter for ListGroupResources , AWS
          Resource  Groups  validates  your  filter resource types against the
          types that are defined in the query associated with the  group.  For
          example, if a group contains only S3 buckets because its query spec-
          ifies  only  that  resource  type,  but  your  resource-type  filter
          includes  EC2 instances, AWS Resource Groups does not filter for EC2
          instances. In this case,  a  ListGroupResources  request  returns  a
          BadRequestException error with a message similar to the following:
              The  resource  types specified as filters in the request are not
              valid.

          The error includes a list of resource types that failed the  valida-
          tion  because  they  are  not  part of the query associated with the
          group. This validation doesn't occur when the group query  specifies
          AWS::AllSupported  ,  because a group based on such a query can con-
          tain any of the allowed resource types for the query type (tag-based
          or AWS CloudFormation stack-based queries).

          (structure)
              A  filter  name  and value pair that is used to obtain more spe-
              cific results from a list of resources.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values.  Allowed  filter  values  vary  by
                 resource filter name, and are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "resource-type",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all of the resources in a resource group

       Example 1: The following list-resource-groups example lists all of  the
       resources that are part of the specified resource group.

          aws resource-groups list-group-resources \
              --group-name tbq-WebServer

       Output:

          {
              "ResourceIdentifiers": [
                  {
                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-09f77fa38c12345ab",
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example  2:  The  following  example  lists all of the resources in the
       group that also have a 'resource-type' of the 'AWS::EC2::Instance'. :

          aws resource-groups list-group-resources
                 --group-name tbq-WebServer --filters  Name=resource-type,Val-
                 ues=AWS::EC2::Instance

OUTPUT
       Resources -> (list)
          An  array  of resources from which you can determine each resource's
          identity, type, and group membership status.

          (structure)
              A structure returned by the  ListGroupResources  operation  that
              contains  identity  and  group membership status information for
              one of the resources in the group.

              Identifier -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains the  ARN  of  a  resource  and  its
                 resource type.

                 ResourceArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of a resource.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     The    resource    type    of   a   resource,   such   as
                     AWS::EC2::Instance .

              Status -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains the status of this resource's  mem-
                 bership in the group.

                 NOTE:
                     This  field  is present in the response only if the group
                     is of type AWS::EC2::HostManagement .

                 Name -> (string)
                     The current status.

       ResourceIdentifiers -> (list)

          WARNING:
              ** Deprecated - don't use this parameter. Use the  ``Resources``
              response field instead. **

          (structure)
              A structure that contains the ARN of a resource and its resource
              type.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type of a resource, such as AWS::EC2::Instance .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value  in  the  NextToken  request
          parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element comes back as null .

       QueryErrors -> (list)
          A  list of QueryError objects. Each error is an object that contains
          ErrorCode and Message structures. Possible values for ErrorCode  are
          CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE  and CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_NOT_EXISTING
          .

          (structure)
              A two-part error structure that can occur in  ListGroupResources
              or  SearchResources  operations  on  CloudFormation  stack-based
              queries. The error occurs if the CloudFormation stack  on  which
              the  query  is based either does not exist, or has a status that
              renders the stack inactive. A  QueryError  occurrence  does  not
              necessarily mean that AWS Resource Groups could not complete the
              operation,  but  the  resulting  group  might  have  no   member
              resources.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 Possible  values are CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE and CLOUD-
                 FORMATION_STACK_NOT_EXISTING .

              Message -> (string)
                 A message that explains the ErrorCode value.  Messages  might
                 state  that the specified CloudFormation stack does not exist
                 (or no longer exists).  For  CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE  ,
                 the  message  typically  states that the CloudFormation stack
                 has a status that is not (or no longer) active, such as  CRE-
                 ATE_FAILED .
