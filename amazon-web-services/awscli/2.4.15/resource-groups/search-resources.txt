SEARCH-RESOURCES()                                          SEARCH-RESOURCES()



NAME
       search-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of AWS resource identifiers that matches the specified
       query. The query uses the same format as a resource query in a  Create-
       Group or UpdateGroupQuery operation.
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

       o resource-groups:SearchResources

       o cloudformation:DescribeStacks

       o cloudformation:ListStackResources

       o tag:GetResources

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-resources  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ResourceIdentifiers

SYNOPSIS
            search-resources
          --resource-query <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-query (structure)
          The search query, using the same  formats  that  are  supported  for
          resource  group definition. For more information, see  CreateGroup .

          Type -> (string)
              The type of the query. You can use the following values:

              o
                *
                CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0: * Specifies that the Query  contains
                an ARN for a CloudFormation stack.

              o ``TAG_FILTERS_1_0:``  * Specifies that the ``Query`` parameter
                contains a JSON string that represents a collection of  simple
                tag  filters for resource types and tags. The JSON string uses
                a    syntax    similar     to     the     ``     `GetResources
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html>`__ ``  operation,  but
                uses  only  the `` `ResourceTypeFilters <https://docs.aws.ama-
                zon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetRe-
                sources.html#resourcegrouptagging-GetRe-
                sources-request-ResourceTypeFilters>`__ `` and ``  `TagFilters
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html#resourcegrouptag-
                ging-GetResources-request-TagFiltersTagFilters>`__  `` fields.
                If you specify more than one  tag  key,  only  resources  that
                match  all  tag keys, and at least one value of each specified
                tag key, are returned in your query. If you specify more  than
                one  value  for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it
                has a tag key value that matches *any of the specified values.
                For example, consider the following sample query for resources
                that have two tags, Stage and Version , with two values  each:
                [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]        The
                results of this query could include the following.

                o An  EC2  instance  that  has   the   following   two   tags:
                  {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                o An   S3   bucket   that   has   the   following   two  tags:
                  {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

              The query would not include the following items in the  results,
              however.

                 o An   EC2   instance   that  has  only  the  following  tag:
                   {"Stage":"Deploy"} . The instance does not have all of  the
                   tag  keys  specified  in the filter, so it is excluded from
                   the results.

                 o An  RDS  database  that  has  the   following   two   tags:
                   {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database has
                   all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an  associ-
                   ated  value that matches at least one of the specified val-
                   ues in the filter.

          Query -> (string)
              The query that defines a group or a search.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Query=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0"|"CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
            "Query": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To find resources that match a query

       The  following  search-resources  example  retrieves  a list of all AWS
       resources that match the specified query.

          aws resource-groups search-resources \
              --resource-query file://query.json

       Contents of query.json:

          {
              "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
              "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Patch Group\", \"Values\":[\"Dev\"]}]}"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ResourceIdentifiers": [
                  {
                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-01a23bc45d67890ef",
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ResourceIdentifiers -> (list)
          The ARNs and resource types of resources that  are  members  of  the
          group that you specified.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains the ARN of a resource and its resource
              type.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type of a resource, such as AWS::EC2::Instance .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value  in  the  NextToken  request
          parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element comes back as null .

       QueryErrors -> (list)
          A  list of QueryError objects. Each error is an object that contains
          ErrorCode and Message structures. Possible values for ErrorCode  are
          CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE  and CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_NOT_EXISTING
          .

          (structure)
              A two-part error structure that can occur in  ListGroupResources
              or  SearchResources  operations  on  CloudFormation  stack-based
              queries. The error occurs if the CloudFormation stack  on  which
              the  query  is based either does not exist, or has a status that
              renders the stack inactive. A  QueryError  occurrence  does  not
              necessarily mean that AWS Resource Groups could not complete the
              operation,  but  the  resulting  group  might  have  no   member
              resources.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 Possible  values are CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE and CLOUD-
                 FORMATION_STACK_NOT_EXISTING .

              Message -> (string)
                 A message that explains the ErrorCode value.  Messages  might
                 state  that the specified CloudFormation stack does not exist
                 (or no longer exists).  For  CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE  ,
                 the  message  typically  states that the CloudFormation stack
                 has a status that is not (or no longer) active, such as  CRE-
                 ATE_FAILED .
