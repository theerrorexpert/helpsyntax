SYNOPSIS
            create-group
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--resource-query <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the group, which is the identifier of the group in other
          operations. You can't change the name of a resource group after  you
          create  it.  A  resource group name can consist of letters, numbers,
          hyphens, periods, and underscores. The name cannot start with AWS or
          aws  ;  these  are  reserved.  A  resource group name must be unique
          within each AWS Region in your AWS account.

       --description (string)
          The description of the resource group. Descriptions can  consist  of
          letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, periods, and spaces.

       --resource-query (structure)
          The  resource  query that determines which AWS resources are members
          of this group. For more  information  about  resource  queries,  see
          Create a tag-based group in Resource Groups .

          NOTE:
              A resource group can contain either a ResourceQuery or a Config-
              uration , but not both.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of the query. You can use the following values:

              o
                *
                CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0: * Specifies that the Query  contains
                an ARN for a CloudFormation stack.

              o ``TAG_FILTERS_1_0:``  * Specifies that the ``Query`` parameter
                contains a JSON string that represents a collection of  simple
                tag  filters for resource types and tags. The JSON string uses
                a    syntax    similar     to     the     ``     `GetResources
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html>`__ ``  operation,  but
                uses  only  the `` `ResourceTypeFilters <https://docs.aws.ama-
                zon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetRe-
                sources.html#resourcegrouptagging-GetRe-
                sources-request-ResourceTypeFilters>`__ `` and ``  `TagFilters
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html#resourcegrouptag-
                ging-GetResources-request-TagFiltersTagFilters>`__  `` fields.
                If you specify more than one  tag  key,  only  resources  that
                match  all  tag keys, and at least one value of each specified
                tag key, are returned in your query. If you specify more  than
                one  value  for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it
                has a tag key value that matches *any of the specified values.
                For example, consider the following sample query for resources
                that have two tags, Stage and Version , with two values  each:
                [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]        The
                results of this query could include the following.

                o An  EC2  instance  that  has   the   following   two   tags:
                  {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                o An   S3   bucket   that   has   the   following   two  tags:
                  {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

              The query would not include the following items in the  results,
              however.

                 o An   EC2   instance   that  has  only  the  following  tag:
                   {"Stage":"Deploy"} . The instance does not have all of  the
                   tag  keys  specified  in the filter, so it is excluded from
                   the results.

                 o An  RDS  database  that  has  the   following   two   tags:
                   {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database has
                   all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an  associ-
                   ated  value that matches at least one of the specified val-
                   ues in the filter.

          Query -> (string)
              The query that defines a group or a search.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Query=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0"|"CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
            "Query": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          The tags to add to the group. A tag is key-value pair string.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --configuration (list)
          A configuration associates the resource group with  an  AWS  service
          and specifies how the service can interact with the resources in the
          group. A configuration is an array of   GroupConfigurationItem  ele-
          ments.  For  details about the syntax of service configurations, see
          Service configurations for resource groups .

          NOTE:
              A resource  group  can  contain  either  a  Configuration  or  a
              ResourceQuery , but not both.

          (structure)
              An  item in a group configuration. A group service configuration
              can have one or more items. For details about group service con-
              figuration  syntax,  see  Service  configurations  for  resource
              groups .

              Type -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of group  configuration  item.  Each  item
                 must  have  a  unique  value for type . For the list of types
                 that you can specify for a configuration item, see  Supported
                 resource types and parameters .

              Parameters -> (list)
                 A collection of parameters for this group configuration item.
                 For the list of parameters that you can use with each config-
                 uration  item  type, see Supported resource types and parame-
                 ters .

                 (structure)
                     A parameter for a group configuration item.  For  details
                     about  group  service  configuration  syntax, see Service
                     configurations for resource groups .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the group configuration parameter. For the
                        list of parameters that you can use with each configu-
                        ration item type, see  Supported  resource  types  and
                        parameters .

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  value  or  values  to  be  used for the specified
                        parameter. For the list of values  you  can  use  with
                        each  parameter,  see  Supported  resource  types  and
                        parameters .

                        (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "string",
              "Parameters": [
                {
                  "Name": "string",
                  "Values": ["string", ...]
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a tag-based resource group

       The following create-group example creates a tag-based  resource  group
       of  Amazon  EC2  instances in the current region. It's based on a query
       for resources that are tagged with the key Name,  and  the  value  Web-
       Servers.  The  group  name is tbq-WebServer. The query is in a separate
       JSON file that is passed to the command.

          aws resource-groups create-group \
              --name tbq-WebServer \
              --resource-query file://query.json

       Contents of query.json:

          {
              "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
              "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\", \"Values\":[\"WebServers\"]}]}"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Group": {
                  "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/tbq-WebServer",
                  "Name": "tbq-WebServer"
              },
              "ResourceQuery": {
                  "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
                  "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\", \"Values\":[\"WebServers\"]}]}"
              }
          }

       Example 2: To create a CloudFormation stack-based resource group

       The  following  create-group  example  creates  an  AWS  CloudFormation
       stack-based   resource   group  named  sampleCFNstackgroup.  The  query
       includes all resources in the specified CloudFormation stack  that  are
       supported by AWS Resource Groups.

          aws resource-groups create-group \
              --name cbq-CFNstackgroup \
              --resource-query file://query.json

       Contents of query.json:

          {
              "Type": "CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
              "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::AllSupported\"],\"StackIdentifier\":\"arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/MyCFNStack/1415z9z0-z39z-11z8-97z5-500z212zz6fz\"}"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Group": {
                  "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/cbq-CFNstackgroup",
                  "Name": "cbq-CFNstackgroup"
              },
              "ResourceQuery": {
                  "Type": "CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
                  "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::AllSupported\"],\"StackIdentifier\":\"arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-2:123456789012:stack/MyCFNStack/1415z9z0-z39z-11z8-97z5-500z212zz6fz\"}"}'
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The description of the resource group.

          GroupArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource group.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the resource group.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the resource group.

       ResourceQuery -> (structure)
          The resource query associated with the group. For  more  information
          about  resource  queries,  see  Create a tag-based group in Resource
          Groups .

          Type -> (string)
              The type of the query. You can use the following values:

              o
                *
                CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0: * Specifies that the Query  contains
                an ARN for a CloudFormation stack.

              o ``TAG_FILTERS_1_0:``  * Specifies that the ``Query`` parameter
                contains a JSON string that represents a collection of  simple
                tag  filters for resource types and tags. The JSON string uses
                a    syntax    similar     to     the     ``     `GetResources
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html>`__ ``  operation,  but
                uses  only  the `` `ResourceTypeFilters <https://docs.aws.ama-
                zon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetRe-
                sources.html#resourcegrouptagging-GetRe-
                sources-request-ResourceTypeFilters>`__ `` and ``  `TagFilters

                ging-GetResources-request-TagFiltersTagFilters>`__  `` fields.
                If you specify more than one  tag  key,  only  resources  that
                match  all  tag keys, and at least one value of each specified
                tag key, are returned in your query. If you specify more  than
                one  value  for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it
                has a tag key value that matches *any of the specified values.
                For example, consider the following sample query for resources
                that have two tags, Stage and Version , with two values  each:
                [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]        The
                results of this query could include the following.

                o An  EC2  instance  that  has   the   following   two   tags:
                  {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                o An   S3   bucket   that   has   the   following   two  tags:
                  {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

              The query would not include the following items in the  results,
              however.

                 o An   EC2   instance   that  has  only  the  following  tag:
                   {"Stage":"Deploy"} . The instance does not have all of  the
                   tag  keys  specified  in the filter, so it is excluded from
                   the results.

                 o An  RDS  database  that  has  the   following   two   tags:
                   {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database has
                   all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an  associ-
                   ated  value that matches at least one of the specified val-
                   ues in the filter.
