NAME
       get-group-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  resource  query  associated with the specified resource
       group. For more  information  about  resource  queries,  see  Create  a
       tag-based group in Resource Groups .
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

       o resource-groups:GetGroupQuery

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-group-query
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          Don't use this parameter. Use Group instead.

       --group (string)
          The name or the ARN of the resource group to query.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the query attached to a resource group

       The  following  get-group-query  example displays query attached to the
       specified resource group.

          aws resource-groups get-group-query \
              --group-name tbq-WebServer

       Output:

          {
              "GroupQuery": {
                  "GroupName": "tbq-WebServer",
                  "ResourceQuery": {
                      "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
                      "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\", \"Values\":[\"WebServers\"]}]}"
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       GroupQuery -> (structure)
          The resource query associated with the  specified  group.  For  more
          information  about resource queries, see Create a tag-based group in
          Resource Groups .

          GroupName -> (string)
              The name of the resource group that is associated with the spec-
              ified resource query.

          ResourceQuery -> (structure)
              The  resource query that determines which AWS resources are mem-
              bers of the associated resource group.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the query. You can use the following values:

                 o
                   *
                   CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0: * Specifies that the  Query  con-
                   tains an ARN for a CloudFormation stack.

                 o ``TAG_FILTERS_1_0:`` * Specifies that the ``Query`` parame-
                   ter contains a JSON string that represents a collection  of
                   simple  tag  filters  for resource types and tags. The JSON
                   string uses  a  syntax  similar  to  the  ``  `GetResources
                   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                   est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html>`__  ``   operation,
                   but     uses     only     the    ``    `ResourceTypeFilters
                   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                   est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html#resourcegrouptag-
                   ging-GetResources-request-ResourceTypeFilters>`__ `` and ``
                   `TagFilters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstag-
                   ging/latest/APIReference/API_GetResources.html#resource-
                   grouptagging-GetResources-request-TagFiltersTagFilters>`__
                   `` fields. If you specify  more  than  one  tag  key,  only
                   resources  that  match all tag keys, and at least one value
                   of each specified tag key, are returned in your  query.  If
                   you  specify  more than one value for a tag key, a resource
                   matches the filter if it has a tag key value  that  matches
                   *any  of  the  specified  values. For example, consider the
                   following sample query for resources that  have  two  tags,
                   Stage    and    Version    ,    with   two   values   each:
                   [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]     The
                   results of this query could include the following.

                   o An   EC2  instance  that  has  the  following  two  tags:
                     {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                   o An  S3  bucket  that  has   the   following   two   tags:
                     {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

                 The  query  would  not  include  the  following  items in the
                 results, however.

                     o An EC2  instance  that  has  only  the  following  tag:
                       {"Stage":"Deploy"}  . The instance does not have all of
                       the tag keys specified in the filter, so it is excluded
                       from the results.

                     o An  RDS  database  that  has  the  following  two tags:
                       {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database
                       has  all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an
                       associated value that matches at least one of the spec-
                       ified values in the filter.

              Query -> (string)
                 The query that defines a group or a search.
