DESCRIPTION
       AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your
       multiple AWS accounts into an organization and  centrally  manage  your
       accounts and their resources.

       This  guide  provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For
       more information about using this service, see  the  AWS  Organizations
       User Guide .
          Support and feedback for AWS Organizations

       We     welcome     your     feedback.    Send    your    comments    to
       feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com or post your  feedback  and  ques-
       tions  in  the  AWS  Organizations support forum . For more information
       about the AWS support forums, see Forums Help .
          Endpoint to call When using the AWS CLI or the AWS SDK

       For the current release of Organizations, specify the us-east-1  region
       for  all AWS API and AWS CLI calls made from the commercial AWS Regions
       outside of China. If calling from one of the AWS Regions in China, then
       specify  cn-northwest-1 . You can do this in the AWS CLI by using these
       parameters and commands:

       o Use the following parameter with each command  to  specify  both  the
         endpoint    and   its   region:    --endpoint-url   https://organiza-
         tions.us-east-1.amazonaws.com  (from commercial AWS  Regions  outside
         of   China)     or    --endpoint-url  https://organizations.cn-north-
         west-1.amazonaws.com.cn  (from AWS Regions in China)

       o Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this
         command:   aws  configure set default.region us-east-1  (from commer-
         cial  AWS  Regions  outside  of  China)    or   aws   configure   set
         default.region cn-northwest-1  (from AWS Regions in China)

       o Use  the  following  parameter  with each command to specify the end-
         point:  --region us-east-1  (from commercial AWS Regions  outside  of
         China)   or  --region cn-northwest-1  (from AWS Regions in China)
          Recording API Requests

       AWS  Organizations  supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS
       API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an  Amazon  S3
       bucket.  By  using  information  collected  by  AWS CloudTrail, you can
       determine which requests the Organizations service received,  who  made
       the  request  and when, and so on. For more about AWS Organizations and
       its support for AWS CloudTrail, see Logging  AWS  Organizations  Events
       with AWS CloudTrail in the AWS Organizations User Guide . To learn more
       about AWS CloudTrail, including how to turn it on  and  find  your  log
       files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide .
