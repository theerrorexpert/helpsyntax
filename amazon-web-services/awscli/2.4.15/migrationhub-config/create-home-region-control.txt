DESCRIPTION
       This API sets up the home region for the calling account only.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-home-region-control
          --home-region <value>
          --target <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --home-region (string)
          The name of the home region of the calling account.

       --target (structure)
          The  account  for  which this command sets up a home region control.
          The Target is always of type ACCOUNT .

          Type -> (string)
              The target type is always an ACCOUNT .

          Id -> (string)
              The TargetID is a 12-character identifier  of  the  ACCOUNT  for
              which  the  control  was  created.  (This  must  be  the current
              account.)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Id=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "ACCOUNT",
            "Id": "string"
          }

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Optional Boolean flag to indicate whether  any  effect  should  take
          place.  It tests whether the caller has permission to make the call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          RequestedTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp representing the time when the customer called  Cre-
