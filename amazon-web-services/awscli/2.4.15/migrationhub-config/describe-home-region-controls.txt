DESCRIPTION
       This API permits filtering on the ControlId and HomeRegion fields.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-home-region-controls
          [--control-id <value>]
          [--home-region <value>]
          [--target <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --control-id (string)
          The  ControlID  is a unique identifier string of your HomeRegionCon-
          trol object.

       --home-region (string)
          The name of the home region you'd like to view.

       --target (structure)
          The target parameter specifies the  identifier  to  which  the  home
          region  is applied, which is always of type ACCOUNT . It applies the
          home region to the current ACCOUNT .

          Type -> (string)
              The target type is always an ACCOUNT .

          Id -> (string)
              The TargetID is a 12-character identifier  of  the  ACCOUNT  for
              which  the  control  was  created.  (This  must  be  the current
              account.)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Id=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "ACCOUNT",
            "Id": "string"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of filtering results to display per page.

       --next-token (string)
          If a NextToken was returned by a previous  call,  more  results  are
          available. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again
          using the returned token in NextToken .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HomeRegionControls -> (list)
          An array that contains your HomeRegionControl objects.

          (structure)
              A home region control is  an  object  that  specifies  the  home
              region for an account, with some additional information. It con-
              tains a target (always of type ACCOUNT ), an ID, and a  time  at
              which the home region was set.

              ControlId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  that's  generated for each home region
                 control. It's always a string that begins  with  "hrc-"  fol-
                 lowed by 12 lowercase letters and numbers.

              HomeRegion -> (string)
                 The  AWS  Region that's been set as home region. For example,
                 "us-west-2" or "eu-central-1" are valid home regions.

              Target -> (structure)
                 The target parameter specifies the identifier  to  which  the
                 home  region  is  applied,  which  is  always an ACCOUNT . It
                 applies the home region to the current ACCOUNT .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The target type is always an ACCOUNT .

                 Id -> (string)
                     The TargetID is a 12-character identifier of the  ACCOUNT
                     for which the control was created. (This must be the cur-
                     rent account.)

              RequestedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp representing the time when  the  customer  called
                 CreateHomeregionControl  and  set  the  home  region  for the
                 account.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If a NextToken was returned by a previous  call,  more  results  are
          available. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again
          using the returned token in NextToken .
