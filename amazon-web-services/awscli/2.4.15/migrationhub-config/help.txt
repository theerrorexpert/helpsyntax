NAME
       migrationhub-config -

DESCRIPTION
       The  AWS  Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for
       working with your Migration Hub home region. You can use these APIs  to
       determine  a  home  region, as well as to create and work with controls
       that describe the home region.

       o You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate,
         disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a HomeRe-
         gionNotSetException error is returned.

       o API calls for read actions (list, describe,  stop,  and  delete)  are
         permitted outside of your home region.

       o If  you  call a write API outside the home region, an InvalidInputEx-
         ception is returned.

       o You can call GetHomeRegion action to obtain the  account's  Migration
         Hub home region.

       For specific API usage, see the sections that follow in this AWS Migra-
       tion Hub Home Region API reference.
