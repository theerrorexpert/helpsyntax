CREATE-ROUTING-CONTROL()                              CREATE-ROUTING-CONTROL()



NAME
       create-routing-control -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new routing control.

       A  routing  control  has one of two states: ON and OFF. You can map the
       routing control state to the state of an Amazon Route 53 health  check,
       which can be used to control traffic routing.

       To  get  or  update the routing control state, see the Recovery Cluster
       (data plane) API actions for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery  Con-
       troller.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-routing-control
          [--client-token <value>]
          --cluster-arn <value>
          [--control-panel-arn <value>]
          --routing-control-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive  string  of up to 64 ASCII characters. To
          make an idempotent API request with  an  action,  specify  a  client
          token in the request.

       --cluster-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the cluster that includes the
          routing control.

       --control-panel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control  panel  that  includes
          the routing control.

       --routing-control-name (string)
          The name of the routing control.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RoutingControl -> (structure)
          The routing control that is created.

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  control  panel that
              includes the routing control.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the routing control.

          RoutingControlArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the routing control.

          Status -> (string)
              The deployment status of a routing control. Status can be one of
              the following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.
