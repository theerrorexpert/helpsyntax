CREATE-SAFETY-RULE()                                      CREATE-SAFETY-RULE()



NAME
       create-safety-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  safety  rule  in  a control panel. Safety rules let you add
       safeguards around changing routing control states, and for enabling and
       disabling routing controls, to help prevent unexpected outcomes.

       There  are two types of safety rules: assertion rules and gating rules.

       Assertion rule: An assertion rule enforces  that,  when  you  change  a
       routing control state, that a certain criteria is met. For example, the
       criteria might be that at least one routing control state is  On  after
       the  transation  so that traffic continues to flow to at least one cell
       for the application. This ensures that you avoid a fail-open  scenario.

       Gating  rule: A gating rule lets you configure a gating routing control
       as an overall "on/off" switch for a group of routing controls. Or,  you
       can configure more complex gating scenarios, for example by configuring
       multiple gating routing controls.

       For more information, see Safety rules in the Amazon Route 53  Applica-
       tion Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            create-safety-rule
          [--assertion-rule <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--gating-rule <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assertion-rule (structure)
          The assertion rule requested.

          AssertedControls -> (list)
              The  routing  controls  that  are  part of transactions that are
              evaluated to determine if a request to change a routing  control
              state  is  allowed. For example, you might include three routing
              controls, one for each of three Amazon Web Services Regions.

              (string)

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the control panel.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the assertion rule. You can use any non-white  space
              character in the name.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The criteria that you set for specific assertion controls (rout-
              ing controls) that designate how many control states must be  ON
              as  the  result of a transaction. For example, if you have three
              assertion controls, you might specify  ATLEAST  2for  your  rule
              configuration.  This  means that at least two assertion controls
              must be ON, so that at least two  Amazon  Web  Services  Regions
              have traffic flowing to them.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule  type.  That
                 is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when
                 you specify an ATLEAST type.

              Type -> (string)
                 A rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds  (ms),  during  which  any
              request  against  the  target  routing  controls will fail. This
              helps prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by
              default, but you can choose a custom value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AssertedControls=string,string,ControlPanelArn=string,Name=string,RuleConfig={Inverted=boolean,Threshold=integer,Type=string},WaitPeriodMs=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AssertedControls": ["string", ...],
            "ControlPanelArn": "string",
            "Name": "string",
            "RuleConfig": {
              "Inverted": true|false,
              "Threshold": integer,
              "Type": "ATLEAST"|"AND"|"OR"
            },
            "WaitPeriodMs": integer
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive  string  of up to 64 ASCII characters. To
          make an idempotent API request with  an  action,  specify  a  client
          token in the request.

       --gating-rule (structure)
          The gating rule requested.

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

          GatingControls -> (list)
              The  gating  controls  for the new gating rule. That is, routing
              controls that are evaluated by the rule configuration  that  you
              specify.

              (string)

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the new gating rule.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The  criteria that you set for specific gating controls (routing
              controls) that designates how many control states must be ON  to
              allow you to change (set or unset) the target control states.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule  type.  That
                 is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when
                 you specify an ATLEAST type.

              Type -> (string)
                 A rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.

          TargetControls -> (list)
              Routing controls that can only be set or unset if the  specified
              RuleConfig  evaluates  to true for the specified GatingControls.
              For example, say you have three gating controls, one for each of
              three  Amazon Web Services Regions. Now you specify AtLeast 2 as
              your RuleConfig. With these settings, you can only  change  (set
              or  unset)  the routing controls that you have specified as Tar-
              getControls if that rule evaluates to true.

              In other words, your ability to change the routing controls that
              you  have  specified as TargetControls is gated by the rule that
              you set for the routing controls in GatingControls.

              (string)

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds  (ms),  during  which  any
              request  against  the  target  routing  controls will fail. This
              helps prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by
              default, but you can choose a custom value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ControlPanelArn=string,GatingControls=string,string,Name=string,RuleConfig={Inverted=boolean,Threshold=integer,Type=string},TargetControls=string,string,WaitPeriodMs=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ControlPanelArn": "string",
            "GatingControls": ["string", ...],
            "Name": "string",
            "RuleConfig": {
              "Inverted": true|false,
              "Threshold": integer,
              "Type": "ATLEAST"|"AND"|"OR"
            },
            "TargetControls": ["string", ...],
            "WaitPeriodMs": integer
          }

       --tags (map)
          The tags associated with the safety rule.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

          AssertedControls -> (list)
              The  routing  controls  that  are  part of transactions that are
              evaluated to determine if a request to change a routing  control

              controls, one for each of three Amazon Web Services Regions.

              (string)

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

          Name -> (string)
              Name of the assertion rule. You  can  use  any  non-white  space
              character in the name.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The  criteria  that  you set for specific assertion routing con-
              trols (AssertedControls) that designate how many routing control
              states  must  be ON as the result of a transaction. For example,
              if you have three assertion routing controls, you might  specify
              atleast  2 for your rule configuration. This means that at least
              two assertion routing control states must  be  ON,  so  that  at
              least  two  Amazon  Web Services Regions have traffic flowing to
              them.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The  value  of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule type. That

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds  (ms),  during  which  any
              request  against  the  target  routing  controls will fail. This
              helps prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by
              default, but you can choose a custom value.

          GatingControls -> (list)
              An array of gating routing control Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
              For a simple "on/off" switch, specify the ARN  for  one  routing
              control.  The  gating routing controls are evaluated by the rule
              configuration that you specify to determine if the target  rout-
              ing control states can be changed.

              (string)

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  for  the gating rule. You can use any non-white space
              character in the name.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The criteria that you set for gating routing controls that  des-
              ignates  how  many  of  the routing control states must be ON to
              allow you to update target routing control states.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

          SafetyRuleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gating rule.

          Status -> (string)
              The deployment status of a gating rule. Status can be one of the
              following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.

          TargetControls -> (list)
              An array of target routing control Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)
              for  which the states can only be updated if the rule configura-
              tion that you specify evaluates to true for the  gating  routing
              control.  As  a simple example, if you have a single gating con-
              trol, it acts as an overall "on/off" switch for a set of  target
              routing  controls.  You  can use this to manually override auto-
              mated fail over, for example.

              (string)

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds  (ms),  during  which  any
              request  against  the  target  routing  controls will fail. This
              helps prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by
              default, but you can choose a custom value.
