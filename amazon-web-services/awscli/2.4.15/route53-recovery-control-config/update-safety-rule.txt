UPDATE-SAFETY-RULE()                                      UPDATE-SAFETY-RULE()



NAME
       update-safety-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Update  a  safety rule (an assertion rule or gating rule). You can only
       update the name and the waiting period for a safety rule. To make other
       updates, delete the safety rule and create a new one.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-safety-rule
          [--assertion-rule-update <value>]
          [--gating-rule-update <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assertion-rule-update (structure)
          The assertion rule to update.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name of the assertion rule. You can use any non-white space
              character in the name.

          SafetyRuleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the assertion rule.

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds  (ms),  during  which  any
              request  against  the  target  routing  controls will fail. This
              helps prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by
              default, but you can choose a custom value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,SafetyRuleArn=string,WaitPeriodMs=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "SafetyRuleArn": "string",
            "WaitPeriodMs": integer
          }

       --gating-rule-update (structure)
          The gating rule to update.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  for  the gating rule. You can use any non-white space
              character in the name.

          SafetyRuleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gating rule.

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds  (ms),  during  which  any
              request  against  the  target  routing  controls will fail. This
              helps prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by
              default, but you can choose a custom value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,SafetyRuleArn=string,WaitPeriodMs=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "SafetyRuleArn": "string",
            "WaitPeriodMs": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AssertionRule -> (structure)
          The assertion rule updated.

          AssertedControls -> (list)
              The  routing  controls  that  are  part of transactions that are
              evaluated to determine if a request to change a routing  control
              state  is  allowed. For example, you might include three routing
              controls, one for each of three Amazon Web Services Regions.

              (string)

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

          Name -> (string)
              Name of the assertion rule. You  can  use  any  non-white  space
              character in the name.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The  criteria  that  you set for specific assertion routing con-
              trols (AssertedControls) that designate how many routing control
              states  must  be ON as the result of a transaction. For example,
              if you have three assertion routing controls, you might  specify
              atleast  2 for your rule configuration. This means that at least
              two assertion routing control states must  be  ON,  so  that  at
              least  two  Amazon  Web Services Regions have traffic flowing to
              them.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The  value  of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule type. That
                 is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when
                 you specify an ATLEAST type.

              Type -> (string)
                 A rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.

          SafetyRuleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the assertion rule.

          Status -> (string)
              The deployment status of an assertion rule. Status can be one of
              the following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds  (ms),  during  which  any
              request  against  the  target  routing  controls will fail. This
              helps prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by
              default, but you can choose a custom value.

       GatingRule -> (structure)
          The gating rule updated.

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

          GatingControls -> (list)
              An array of gating routing control Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
              For a simple "on/off" switch, specify the ARN  for  one  routing
              control.  The  gating routing controls are evaluated by the rule
              configuration that you specify to determine if the target  rout-
              ing control states can be changed.

              (string)

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  for  the gating rule. You can use any non-white space
              character in the name.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The criteria that you set for gating routing controls that  des-
              ignates  how  many  of  the routing control states must be ON to
              allow you to update target routing control states.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The  value  of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule type. That
                 is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when
                 you specify an ATLEAST type.

              Type -> (string)
                 A rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.

          SafetyRuleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gating rule.

          Status -> (string)
              The deployment status of a gating rule. Status can be one of the
              following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.

          TargetControls -> (list)
              An array of target routing control Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)
              for  which the states can only be updated if the rule configura-
              tion that you specify evaluates to true for the  gating  routing
              control.  As  a simple example, if you have a single gating con-
              trol, it acts as an overall "on/off" switch for a set of  target
              routing  controls.  You  can use this to manually override auto-
              mated fail over, for example.

              (string)

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds  (ms),  during  which  any
              request  against  the  target  routing  controls will fail. This
              helps prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by
              default, but you can choose a custom value.
