DESCRIBE-CLUSTER()                                          DESCRIBE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       describe-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Display  the details about a cluster. The response includes the cluster
       name, endpoints, status, and Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster
          --cluster-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Cluster -> (structure)
          The cluster for the DescribeCluster request.

          ClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.

          ClusterEndpoints -> (list)
              Endpoints for a cluster. Specify one of these endpoints when you
              want  to set or retrieve a routing control state in the cluster.

              53 Application Recovery Controller Routing Control Actions.

              (structure)
                 A  cluster endpoint. Specify an endpoint when you want to set
                 or retrieve a routing control state in the cluster.

                 Endpoint -> (string)
                     A cluster endpoint. Specify an endpoint  and  Amazon  Web
                     Services  Region when you want to set or retrieve a rout-
                     ing control state in the cluster.

                     To get or update the routing control state, see the  Ama-
                     zon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Routing Con-

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the cluster.

          Status -> (string)
              Deployment status of a resource. Status can be one of  the  fol-
