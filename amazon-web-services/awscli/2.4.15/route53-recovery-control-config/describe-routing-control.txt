DESCRIBE-ROUTING-CONTROL()                          DESCRIBE-ROUTING-CONTROL()



NAME
       describe-routing-control -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  details about a routing control. A routing control has one of
       two states: ON and OFF. You can map the routing control  state  to  the
       state  of an Amazon Route 53 health check, which can be used to control
       routing.

       To get or update the routing control state, see  the  Recovery  Cluster
       (data  plane) API actions for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Con-
       troller.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-routing-control
          --routing-control-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --routing-control-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the routing control.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
