BATCH-GET-DEVICE-POSITION()                        BATCH-GET-DEVICE-POSITION()



NAME
       batch-get-device-position -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the latest device positions for requested devices.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-device-position
          --device-ids <value>
          --tracker-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-ids (list)
          Devices whose position you want to retrieve.

          o For     example,     for     two     devices:     device-ids=Devi-
            ceId1&device-ids=DeviceId2

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tracker-name (string)
          The tracker resource retrieving the device position.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DevicePositions -> (list)
          Contains device position details such as the  device  ID,  position,
          and timestamps for when the position was received and sampled.

          (structure)
              Contains the device position details.

              Accuracy -> (structure)
                 The accuracy of the device position.

                 Horizontal -> (double)
                     Estimated  maximum  distance, in meters, between the mea-
                     sured position and the true position of a  device,  along
                     the Earth's surface.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device whose position you retrieved.

              Position -> (list)
                 The last known device position.

                 (double)

              PositionProperties -> (map)
                 The properties associated with the position.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ReceivedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  for  when  the  tracker resource received the
                 device position in ISO 8601 format:  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ
                 .

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp at which the device's position was determined.
                 Uses ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       Errors -> (list)
          Contains error details for each device that failed to send its posi-
          tion to the tracker resource.

          (structure)
              Contains  error  details  for  each  device that didn't return a
              position.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the device that didn't return a position.

              Error -> (structure)
                 Contains details related to the error code.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The error code associated with the batch request error.

                 Message -> (string)
                     A message with the reason for the batch request error.
