DESCRIPTION
       Creates a map resource in your AWS account, which provides map tiles of
       different styles sourced from global location data providers.

       NOTE:
          If your application is tracking or routing assets you  use  in  your
          business,  such  as delivery vehicles or employees, you may only use
          HERE as your geolocation provider. See section 82 of the AWS service
          terms for more details.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Valid Esri map styles :

              o VectorEsriDarkGrayCanvas  The Esri Dark Gray Canvas map style.
                A  vector  basemap  with  a dark gray, neutral background with
                minimal colors, labels, and features that's designed  to  draw
                attention to your thematic content.

              o RasterEsriImagery   The  Esri  Imagery  map  style.  A  raster
                basemap that provides one meter or better satellite and aerial
                imagery in many parts of the world and lower resolution satel-
                lite imagery worldwide.

              o VectorEsriLightGrayCanvas  The  Esri  Light  Gray  Canvas  map
                style,  which  provides a detailed vector basemap with a light
                gray, neutral background style with  minimal  colors,  labels,
                and  features  that's  designed to draw attention to your the-
                matic content.

              o VectorEsriTopographic  The Esri Light map  style,  which  pro-
                vides a detailed vector basemap with a classic Esri map style.

              o VectorEsriStreets  The Esri World  Streets  map  style,  which
                provides  a  detailed  vector basemap for the world symbolized
                with a classic Esri street map style. The vector tile layer is
                similar  in  content  and style to the World Street Map raster
                map.

              o VectorEsriNavigation  The Esri  World  Navigation  map  style,
                which  provides  a  detailed  basemap for the world symbolized
                with a custom navigation map style  that's  designed  for  use
                during the day in mobile devices.

              Valid HERE Technologies map styles :

              o VectorHereBerlin  The HERE Berlin map style is a high contrast
                detailed base map of the world that blends 3D and  2D  render-
                ing.

              NOTE:
                 When  using  HERE  as  your  data provider, and selecting the
                 Style VectorHereBerlin , you may not  use  HERE  Technologies
                 maps for Asset Management. See the AWS Service Terms for Ama-

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Style=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Style": "string"
          }

       --description (string)
          An optional description for the map resource.

       --map-name (string)
          The name for the map resource.

          Requirements:

          o Must contain only alphanumeric characters (AZ,  az,  09),  hyphens
            (-), periods (.), and underscores (_).

          o Must be a unique map resource name.

          o No spaces allowed. For example, ExampleMap .

       --pricing-plan (string)
          No  longer used. If included, the only allowed value is RequestBase-
          dUsage .

          Possible values:

          o RequestBasedUsage

          o MobileAssetTracking

          o MobileAssetManagement

       --tags (map)
          Applies one or more tags to the map resource. A tag is  a  key-value
          pair  helps  manage,  identify, search, and filter your resources by
          labelling them.

          Format: "key" : "value"

          Restrictions:

          o Maximum 50 tags per resource

          o Each resource tag must be unique with a maximum of one value.

          o Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Can use alphanumeric characters (AZ, az, 09),  and  the  following
            characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Cannot use "aws:" as a prefix for a key.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CreateTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the map resource was created in ISO 8601 for-
          mat: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       MapArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the map resource. Used to specify
          a resource across all AWS.

          o Format example: arn:aws:geo:region:account-id:maps/ExampleMap

       MapName -> (string)
          The name of the map resource.
