BATCH-UPDATE-DEVICE-POSITION()                  BATCH-UPDATE-DEVICE-POSITION()



NAME
       batch-update-device-position -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads  position  update  data  for  one  or more devices to a tracker
       resource. Amazon Location uses the data when it reports the last  known
       device  position and position history. Amazon Location retains location
       data for 30 days.

       NOTE:
          Position updates are handled based on the PositionFiltering property
          of the tracker. When PositionFiltering is set to TimeBased , updates
          are evaluated against linked geofence collections, and location data
          is  stored  at  a maximum of one position per 30 second interval. If
          your update frequency is more often than every 30 seconds, only  one
          update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.

          When  PositionFiltering  is set to DistanceBased filtering, location
          data is stored and evaluated  against  linked  geofence  collections
          only if the device has moved more than 30 m (98.4 ft).

          When  PositionFiltering  is set to AccuracyBased filtering, location
          data is stored and evaluated  against  linked  geofence  collections
          only  if  the  device has moved more than the measured accuracy. For
          example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a  horizontal
          accuracy  of  5  m  and 10 m, the second update is neither stored or
          evaluated if the device has moved less than 15 m. If PositionFilter-
          ing  is  set  to  AccuracyBased  filtering, Amazon Location uses the
          default value { "Horizontal": 0} when accuracy is not provided on  a
          DevicePositionUpdate .

SYNOPSIS
            batch-update-device-position
          --tracker-name <value>
          --updates <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --tracker-name (string)
          The name of the tracker resource to update.

       --updates (list)
          Contains the position update details for each device.

          (structure)
              Contains the position update details for a device.

              Accuracy -> (structure)
                 The accuracy of the device position.

                 Horizontal -> (double)
                     Estimated  maximum  distance, in meters, between the mea-
                     sured position and the true position of a  device,  along
                     the Earth's surface.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device associated to the position update.

              Position -> (list)
                 The  latest  device  position defined in WGS 84 format: [X or
                 longitude, Y or latitude] .

                 (double)

              PositionProperties -> (map)
                 Associates one of more properties with the position update. A
                 property  is a key-value pair stored with the position update
                 and added to any geofence event the update may trigger.

                 Format: "key" : "value"

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp at which the device's position was  determined.
                 Uses ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accuracy={Horizontal=double},DeviceId=string,Position=double,double,PositionProperties={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},SampleTime=timestamp ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Accuracy": {
                "Horizontal": double
              },
              "DeviceId": "string",
              "Position": [double, ...],
              "PositionProperties": {"string": "string"
                ...},
              "SampleTime": timestamp
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Errors -> (list)
          Contains  error  details  for  each device that failed to update its
          position.

          (structure)
              Contains error details for each device that failed to update its
              position.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device associated with the failed location update.

              Error -> (structure)
                 Contains  details related to the error code such as the error
                 code and error message.
