NAME
       create-tracker -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a tracker resource in your AWS account, which lets you retrieve
       current and historical location of devices.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-tracker
          [--description <value>]
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--position-filtering <value>]
          [--pricing-plan <value>]
          [--pricing-plan-data-source <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          --tracker-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          An optional description for the tracker resource.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          A key identifier for an AWS KMS customer managed key . Enter  a  key
          ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN.

       --position-filtering (string)
          Specifies the position filtering for the tracker resource.

          Valid values:

          o TimeBased - Location updates are evaluated against linked geofence
            collections, but not every location  update  is  stored.  If  your
            update  frequency  is  more often than 30 seconds, only one update
            per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.

          o DistanceBased - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4  ft),
            location  updates  are  ignored. Location updates within this area
            are neither evaluated against  linked  geofence  collections,  nor
            stored.  This  helps  control  costs  by  reducing  the  number of
            geofence evaluations and historical device positions  to  paginate
            through.  Distance-based  filtering can also reduce the effects of
            GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.

          o AccuracyBased - If the device has moved  less  than  the  measured
            accuracy,  location  updates are ignored. For example, if two con-
            secutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of  5  m
            and  10  m,  the  second update is ignored if the device has moved
            less than 15 m. Ignored location  updates  are  neither  evaluated
            against  linked  geofence collections, nor stored. This can reduce
            the effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on  a
            map,  and  can  help  control your costs by reducing the number of
            geofence evaluations.

          This field is optional. If not specified, the default value is Time-
          Based .

          Possible values:

          o TimeBased

          o DistanceBased

          o AccuracyBased

       --pricing-plan (string)
          No  longer used. If included, the only allowed value is RequestBase-
          dUsage .

          Possible values:

          o RequestBasedUsage

          o MobileAssetTracking

          o MobileAssetManagement

       --pricing-plan-data-source (string)
          This parameter is no longer used.

       --tags (map)
          Applies one or more tags  to  the  tracker  resource.  A  tag  is  a
          key-value  pair  helps  manage,  identify,  search,  and filter your
          resources by labelling them.

          Format: "key" : "value"

          Restrictions:

          o Maximum 50 tags per resource

          o Each resource tag must be unique with a maximum of one value.

          o Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Can use alphanumeric characters (AZ, az, 09),  and  the  following
            characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Cannot use "aws:" as a prefix for a key.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --tracker-name (string)
          The name for the tracker resource.

          Requirements:

          o Contain  only  alphanumeric  characters  (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) , hyphens
            (-), periods (.), and underscores (_).

          o Must be a unique tracker resource name.

          o No spaces allowed. For example, ExampleTracker .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CreateTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the tracker resource was created in ISO  8601
          format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       TrackerArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for the tracker resource. Used when
          you need to specify a resource across all AWS.

          o Format   example:   arn:aws:geo:region:account-id:tracker/Example-
            Tracker

       TrackerName -> (string)
          The name of the tracker resource.
