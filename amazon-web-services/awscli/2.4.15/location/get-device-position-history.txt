GET-DEVICE-POSITION-HISTORY()                    GET-DEVICE-POSITION-HISTORY()



NAME
       get-device-position-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the device position history from a tracker resource within a
       specified range of time.

       NOTE:
          Device positions are deleted after 30 days.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-device-position-history is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DevicePositions

SYNOPSIS
            get-device-position-history
          --device-id <value>
          [--end-time-exclusive <value>]
          [--start-time-inclusive <value>]
          --tracker-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-id (string)
          The device whose position history you want to retrieve.

       --end-time-exclusive (timestamp)
          Specify  the  end  time for the position history in ISO 8601 format:
          YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ . By default, the value will  be  the  time
          that the request is made.

          Requirement:

          o The time specified for EndTimeExclusive must be after the time for
            StartTimeInclusive .

       --start-time-inclusive (timestamp)
          Specify the start time for the position history in ISO 8601  format:
          YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ  .  By  default, the value will be 24 hours
          prior to the time that the request is made.

          Requirement:

          o The time specified for StartTimeInclusive must be before  EndTime-
            Exclusive .

       --tracker-name (string)
          The  tracker  resource receiving the request for the device position
          history.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DevicePositions -> (list)
          Contains the position history details for the requested device.

          (structure)
              Contains the device position details.

              Accuracy -> (structure)
                 The accuracy of the device position.

                 Horizontal -> (double)
                     Estimated maximum distance, in meters, between  the  mea-
                     sured  position  and the true position of a device, along
                     the Earth's surface.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device whose position you retrieved.

              Position -> (list)
                 The last known device position.

                 (double)

              PositionProperties -> (map)
                 The properties associated with the position.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ReceivedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp for when  the  tracker  resource  received  the
                 device  position in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ
                 .

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp at which the device's position was  determined.
                 Uses ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination token indicating there are additional pages available.
          You can use the token in a following request to fetch the  next  set
          of results.
