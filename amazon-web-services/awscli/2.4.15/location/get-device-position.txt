GET-DEVICE-POSITION()                                    GET-DEVICE-POSITION()



NAME
       get-device-position -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a device's most recent position according to its sample time.

       NOTE:
          Device positions are deleted after 30 days.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-device-position
          --device-id <value>
          --tracker-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-id (string)
          The device whose position you want to retrieve.

       --tracker-name (string)
          The tracker resource receiving the position update.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Accuracy -> (structure)
          The accuracy of the device position.

          Horizontal -> (double)
              Estimated maximum distance,  in  meters,  between  the  measured
              position  and  the  true position of a device, along the Earth's
              surface.

       DeviceId -> (string)
          The device whose position you retrieved.

       Position -> (list)
          The last known device position.

          (double)

       PositionProperties -> (map)
          The properties associated with the position.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       ReceivedTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the  tracker  resource  received  the  device
          position in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       SampleTime -> (timestamp)
          The  timestamp  at  which the device's position was determined. Uses
          ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .
