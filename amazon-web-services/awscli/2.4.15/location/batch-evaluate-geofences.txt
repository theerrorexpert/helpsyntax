BATCH-EVALUATE-GEOFENCES()                          BATCH-EVALUATE-GEOFENCES()



NAME
       batch-evaluate-geofences -

DESCRIPTION
       Evaluates device positions against the geofence geometries from a given
       geofence collection.

       This operation always returns an empty response because  geofences  are
       asynchronously  evaluated.  The evaluation determines if the device has
       entered or exited a geofenced area, and then publishes one of the  fol-
       lowing events to Amazon EventBridge:

       o ENTER  if  Amazon  Location  determines  that  the tracked device has
         entered a geofenced area.

       o EXIT if Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has exited
         a geofenced area.

       NOTE:
          The  last  geofence that a device was observed within is tracked for
          30 days after the most recent device position update.

       NOTE:
          Geofence evaluation uses the given  device  position.  It  does  not
          account for the optional Accuracy of a DevicePositionUpdate .

SYNOPSIS
            batch-evaluate-geofences
          --collection-name <value>
          --device-position-updates <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The  geofence  collection used in evaluating the position of devices
          against its geofences.

       --device-position-updates (list)
          Contains device details for each device to be evaluated against  the
          given geofence collection.

          (structure)
              Contains the position update details for a device.

              Accuracy -> (structure)
                 The accuracy of the device position.

                 Horizontal -> (double)
                     Estimated  maximum  distance, in meters, between the mea-
                     sured position and the true position of a  device,  along
                     the Earth's surface.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device associated to the position update.

              Position -> (list)
                 The  latest  device  position defined in WGS 84 format: [X or
                 longitude, Y or latitude] .

                 (double)

              PositionProperties -> (map)
                 Associates one of more properties with the position update. A
                 property  is a key-value pair stored with the position update
                 and added to any geofence event the update may trigger.

                 Format: "key" : "value"

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp at which the device's position was  determined.
                 Uses ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accuracy={Horizontal=double},DeviceId=string,Position=double,double,PositionProperties={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},SampleTime=timestamp ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Accuracy": {
                "Horizontal": double
              },
              "DeviceId": "string",
              "Position": [double, ...],
              "PositionProperties": {"string": "string"
                ...},
              "SampleTime": timestamp
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Errors -> (list)
          Contains  error  details for each device that failed to evaluate its
          position against the given geofence collection.

          (structure)
              Contains error details for each device that failed  to  evaluate
              its  position  against the geofences in a given geofence collec-
              tion.

              DeviceId -> (string)

              Error -> (structure)
                 Contains details associated to the batch error.
