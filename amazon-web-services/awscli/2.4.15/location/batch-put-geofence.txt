BATCH-PUT-GEOFENCE()                                      BATCH-PUT-GEOFENCE()



NAME
       batch-put-geofence -

DESCRIPTION
       A  batch  request for storing geofence geometries into a given geofence
       collection, or updates the  geometry  of  an  existing  geofence  if  a
       geofence ID is included in the request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-put-geofence
          --collection-name <value>
          --entries <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The geofence collection storing the geofences.

       --entries (list)
          The batch of geofences to be stored in a geofence collection.

          (structure)
              Contains geofence geometry details.

              GeofenceId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for  the  geofence  to  be stored in a given
                 geofence collection.

              Geometry -> (structure)
                 Contains the polygon details to specify the position  of  the
                 geofence.

                 NOTE:
                     Each  geofence  polygon  can have a maximum of 1,000 ver-
                     tices.

                 Polygon -> (list)
                     An array of 1 or more linear rings. A linear ring  is  an
                     array  of  4  or  more vertices, where the first and last
                     vertex are the same to form a closed boundary. Each  ver-
                     tex  is  a  2-dimensional  point of the form: [longitude,
                     latitude] .

                     The first linear ring is an outer  ring,  describing  the
                     polygon's  boundary. Subsequent linear rings may be inner
                     or outer rings to describe holes and islands. Outer rings
                     must  list  their  vertices  in  counter-clockwise  order
                     around the ring's center, where  the  left  side  is  the
                     polygon's  exterior. Inner rings must list their vertices
                     in clockwise order, where the left side is the  polygon's
                     interior.

                     (list)
                        (list)
                            (double)

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "GeofenceId": "string",
              "Geometry": {
                "Polygon": [
                  [
                    [double, ...]
                    ...
                  ]
                  ...
                ]
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              in a given geofence collection.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp for when the geofence was stored in a geofence
