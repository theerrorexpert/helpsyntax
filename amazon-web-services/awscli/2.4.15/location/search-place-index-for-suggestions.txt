NAME
       search-place-index-for-suggestions -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  suggestions  for  addresses  and points of interest based on
       partial or misspelled free-form text. This operation is also  known  as
       autocomplete, autosuggest, or fuzzy matching.

       Optional  parameters let you narrow your search results by bounding box
       or country, or bias your search  toward  a  specific  position  on  the
       globe.

       NOTE:
          You  can  search for suggested place names near a specified position
          by using BiasPosition , or filter results within a bounding  box  by
          using  FilterBBox  .  These parameters are mutually exclusive; using
          both BiasPosition and FilterBBox in  the  same  command  returns  an
          error.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS

          [--bias-position <value>]
          [--filter-b-box <value>]
          [--filter-countries <value>]
          --index-name <value>
          [--language <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          --text <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bias-position (list)
          An  optional parameter that indicates a preference for place sugges-
          tions that are closer to a specified position.

          If provided, this parameter must contain  a  pair  of  numbers.  The
          first  number  represents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second
          number represents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

          For example, [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents the position with  lon-
          gitude -123.1174 and latitude 49.2847 .

          NOTE:
              BiasPosition  and  FilterBBox are mutually exclusive. Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-b-box (list)
          An optional parameter that limits the search  results  by  returning
          only suggestions within a specified bounding box.

          If provided, this parameter must contain a total of four consecutive
          numbers in two pairs. The first pair of numbers represents the X and
          Y  coordinates  (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the south-
          west corner of the bounding box; the second pair of  numbers  repre-
          sents the X and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively)
          of the northeast corner of the bounding box.

          For example, [-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542]  represents  a
          bounding  box  where the southwest corner has longitude -12.7935 and
          latitude -37.4835 , and the northeast corner has longitude  -12.0684
          and latitude -36.9542 .

          NOTE:
              FilterBBox  and  BiasPosition are mutually exclusive. Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-countries (list)
          An optional parameter that limits the search  results  by  returning
          only suggestions within the provided list of countries.

          o Use the ISO 3166 3-digit country code. For example, Australia uses
            three upper-case characters: AUS .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --index-name (string)
          The name of the place index resource you want to use for the search.

       --language (string)
          The  preferred  language used to return results. The value must be a
          valid BCP 47 language tag, for example, en for English.

          This setting affects the languages used in the results. It does  not
          change which results are returned. If the language is not specified,
          or not supported for a particular result, the partner  automatically
          chooses a language for the result.

          Used only when the partner selected is Here.

       --max-results (integer)
          An  optional  parameter.  The maximum number of results returned per
          request.

          The default: 5

       --text (string)
          The free-form partial text to use to generate place suggestions. For
          example, eiffel tow .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
