NAME
       search-place-index-for-position -

DESCRIPTION
       Reverse  geocodes  a  given  coordinate  and returns a legible address.
       Allows you to search for Places or points  of  interest  near  a  given
       position.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            search-place-index-for-position
          --index-name <value>
          [--language <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          --position <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-name (string)
          The name of the place index resource you want to use for the search.

       --language (string)
          The preferred language used to return results. The value must  be  a
          valid BCP 47 language tag, for example, en for English.

          This  setting affects the languages used in the results. It does not
          change which results are returned. If the language is not specified,
          or  not supported for a particular result, the partner automatically
          chooses a language for the result.

       --max-results (integer)
          An optional parameter. The maximum number of  results  returned  per
          request.

          Default value: 50

       --position (list)
          Specifies the longitude and latitude of the position to query.

          This parameter must contain a pair of numbers. The first number rep-
          resents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second number represents
          the Y coordinate, or latitude.

          For  example, [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents a position with longi-
          tude -123.1174 and latitude 49.2847 .

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Results -> (list)
          Returns a list of Places closest to  the  specified  position.  Each
          result contains additional information about the Places returned.

          (structure)
              Contains  a  search  result from a position search query that is
              run on a place index resource.

              Distance -> (double)
                 The distance in meters of  a  great-circle  arc  between  the
                 query position and the result.

                 NOTE:
                     A  great-circle  arc is the shortest path on a sphere, in
                     this case the Earth. This returns the  shortest  distance
                     between two locations.

              Place -> (structure)
                 Details  about  the  search  result,  such as its address and
                 position.

                 AddressNumber -> (string)
                     The numerical portion of an address, such as  a  building
                     number.

                     A  country/region  specified using ISO 3166 3-digit coun-
                     try/region code. For example, CAN .

                 Geometry -> (structure)
                     Places uses a point geometry to specify a location  or  a
                     Place.

                     Point -> (list)
                        A  single  point  geometry  specifies a location for a
                        Place using WGS 84 coordinates:

                        o x  Specifies the x coordinate or longitude.

                        o y  Specifies the y coordinate or latitude.

                        (double)

                 Interpolated -> (boolean)
                        True if the result is interpolated  from  other  known
                        places.

                        False if the Place is a known place.

                     mation.

                     For example, returns False for an address  location  that
                     is  found  in  the  partner  data, but returns True if an
                     address does not exist in the partner data and its  loca-
                     tion  is  calculated by interpolating between other known
                     addresses.

                 Label -> (string)
