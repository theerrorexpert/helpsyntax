SEARCH-PLACE-INDEX-FOR-TEXT()                    SEARCH-PLACE-INDEX-FOR-TEXT()



NAME
       search-place-index-for-text -

DESCRIPTION
       Geocodes  free-form  text, such as an address, name, city, or region to
       allow you to search for Places or points of interest.

       Optional parameters let you narrow your search results by bounding  box
       or  country,  or  bias  your  search  toward a specific position on the
       globe.

       NOTE:
          You can search for places near a given position using BiasPosition ,
          or filter results within a bounding box using FilterBBox . Providing
          both parameters simultaneously returns an error.

       Search results are returned in order of highest to lowest relevance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --bias-position (list)
          An optional parameter that indicates a preference  for  places  that
          are closer to a specified position.

          If  provided,  this  parameter  must  contain a pair of numbers. The
          first number represents the X coordinate, or longitude;  the  second
          number represents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

          For  example, [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents the position with lon-
          gitude -123.1174 and latitude 49.2847 .

          NOTE:
              BiasPosition and FilterBBox are mutually  exclusive.  Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-b-box (list)
          An  optional  parameter  that limits the search results by returning
          only places that are within the provided bounding box.

          If provided, this parameter must contain a total of four consecutive
          numbers in two pairs. The first pair of numbers represents the X and
          Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of  the  south-
          west  corner  of the bounding box; the second pair of numbers repre-
          sents the X and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively)
          of the northeast corner of the bounding box.

          For  example,  [-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542] represents a
          bounding box where the southwest corner has longitude  -12.7935  and
          latitude  -37.4835 , and the northeast corner has longitude -12.0684
          and latitude -36.9542 .

          NOTE:
              FilterBBox and BiasPosition are mutually  exclusive.  Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-countries (list)
          An  optional  parameter  that limits the search results by returning
          only places that are in a specified list of countries.

          o Valid values include ISO 3166 3-digit country codes. For  example,
            Australia uses three upper-case characters: AUS .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --index-name (string)
          The name of the place index resource you want to use for the search.

       --language (string)
          The preferred language used to return results. The value must  be  a
          valid BCP 47 language tag, for example, en for English.

          This  setting affects the languages used in the results. It does not
          change which results are returned. If the language is not specified,
          or  not supported for a particular result, the partner automatically
          chooses a language for the result.

       --max-results (integer)
          An optional parameter. The maximum number of  results  returned  per
          request.

          The default: 50

       --text (string)
          The  address,  name,  city,  or  region  to be used in the search in
          free-form text format. For example, 123 Any Street .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Results -> (list)
          A list of Places matching the input text. Each result contains addi-
          tional information about the specific point of interest.

          (structure)
              Contains a search result from a text search query that is run on
              a place index resource.

              Distance -> (double)
                 The distance in meters of a great-circle arc between the bias
                 position  specified and the result. Distance will be returned
                 only if a bias position was specified in the query.

                 NOTE:
                     A great-circle arc is the shortest path on a  sphere,  in
                     this  case  the Earth. This returns the shortest distance
                     between two locations.

              Place -> (structure)
                 Details about the search result,  such  as  its  address  and
                 position.

                 AddressNumber -> (string)
                     The  numerical  portion of an address, such as a building
                     number.

                     A country/region specified using ISO 3166  3-digit  coun-
                     try/region code. For example, CAN .

                 Geometry -> (structure)
                     Places  uses  a point geometry to specify a location or a
                     Place.

                     Point -> (list)
                        A single point geometry specifies  a  location  for  a
                        Place using WGS 84 coordinates:

                        o x  Specifies the x coordinate or longitude.

                        o y  Specifies the y coordinate or latitude.

                        (double)

                 Interpolated -> (boolean)
                        True  if  the  result is interpolated from other known
                        places.

                        False if the Place is a known place.

                     mation.

                     For  example,  returns False for an address location that
                     is found in the partner data,  but  returns  True  if  an
                     address  does not exist in the partner data and its loca-
                     tion is calculated by interpolating between  other  known
                     addresses.

                 Label -> (string)
                     The  full  name and address of the point of interest such

                     mat, which accompanies the address  for  the  purpose  of
                     identifying a location.

                 Region -> (string)
                     A  name  for  an area or geographical division, such as a

                 The relative confidence in the match for a result  among  the
                 results  returned. For example, if more fields for an address
                 match (including house number, street, city,  country/region,
                 and postal code), the relevance score is closer to 1.

                 Returned only when the partner selected is Esri.

       Summary -> (structure)
          Contains a summary of the request. Echoes the input values for Bias-
          Position , FilterBBox , FilterCountries , Language  ,  MaxResults  ,

              resents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second number repre-
              sents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

              For  example,  [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents the position with
              longitude -123.1174 and latitude 49.2847 .
