NAME
       describe-image-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list that describes the permissions for shared AWS account
       IDs on a private image that you own.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-image-permissions
          --name <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--shared-aws-account-ids <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the private image for which to describe permissions. The
          image must be one that you own.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of each page of results.

       --shared-aws-account-ids (list)
          The  12-digit  identifier of one or more AWS accounts with which the
          image is shared.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this  operation. If this value is null, it retrieves the first page.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
