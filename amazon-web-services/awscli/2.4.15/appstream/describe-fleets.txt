DESCRIBE-FLEETS()                                            DESCRIBE-FLEETS()



NAME
       describe-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  that describes one or more specified fleets, if the
       fleet names are provided. Otherwise, all  fleets  in  the  account  are
       described.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-fleets  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Fleets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleets
          [--names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          The names of the fleets to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     ALWAYS_ON

                 Provides  users with instant-on access to their apps. You are
                 charged for all running instances in your fleet, even  if  no
                 users are streaming apps.
                     ON_DEMAND

                 Provide users with access to applications after they connect,
                 which takes one to two minutes. You are charged for  instance
                 streaming when users are connected and a small hourly fee for
                 instances that are not streaming apps.

              ComputeCapacityStatus -> (structure)
                 The capacity status for the fleet.

                 Desired -> (integer)
                     The desired number of streaming instances.

                 Running -> (integer)
                     The total number of simultaneous streaming instances that
                     are running.

                 InUse -> (integer)
                     The number of instances in use for streaming.

                 Available -> (integer)
                     The  number  of currently available instances that can be
                     used to stream sessions.

              MaxUserDurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum amount of  time  that  a  streaming  session  can
                 remain  active, in seconds. If users are still connected to a
                 streaming instance five minutes before this limit is reached,
                 they  are  prompted  to  save any open documents before being
                 disconnected. After this time elapses, the instance is termi-
                 nated and replaced by a new instance.

                 Specify a value between 600 and 360000.

              DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  time that a streaming session remains active
                 after users disconnect. If  they  try  to  reconnect  to  the
                 streaming  session after a disconnection or network interrup-
                 tion within this time interval, they are connected  to  their
                 previous session. Otherwise, they are connected to a new ses-
                 sion with a new streaming instance.

                 Specify a value between 60 and 360000.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state for the fleet.

                 SubnetIds -> (list)
                     The identifiers of the subnets to which a network  inter-
                     face is attached from the fleet instance or image builder
                     instance. Fleet instances use one or more subnets.  Image
                     builder instances use one subnet.

                     (string)

                 SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                     The  identifiers  of the security groups for the fleet or
                     image builder.

                     (string)

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the fleet was created.

              FleetErrors -> (list)
                 The fleet errors.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a fleet error.

                     ErrorCode -> (string)
                        The error code.

                     ErrorMessage -> (string)
                        The error message.

              EnableDefaultInternetAccess -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether default internet access is enabled for  the
                 fleet.

              DomainJoinInfo -> (structure)
                 The name of the directory and organizational unit (OU) to use
                 to join the fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain.

                 DirectoryName -> (string)
                     The fully qualified name of the directory  (for  example,
                     corp.example.com).

                 OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)
                     The  distinguished  name  of  the organizational unit for
                     computer accounts.

              IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The amount of time that users can be idle  (inactive)  before
                 they  are  disconnected  from their streaming session and the
                 DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds time interval  begins.  Users  are
                 notified  before  they are disconnected due to inactivity. If
                 users try to reconnect to the streaming  session  before  the
                 time   interval   specified   in   DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds
                 elapses, they are connected to their previous session.  Users
                 are  considered  idle  when  they  stop providing keyboard or
                 mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads  and
                 downloads,  audio  in,  audio out, and pixels changing do not
                 qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle  after
                 the  time interval in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses,
                 they are disconnected.

                 To prevent users from being disconnected due  to  inactivity,
                 specify  a  value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60
                 and 3600. The default value is 0.

                 NOTE:
                     If you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify
                     a  value  that  corresponds  exactly to a whole number of
                     minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't  do
                     this,  the  value  is  rounded to the nearest minute. For
                     example, if you specify a value of 70, users are  discon-
                     nected  after  1  minute  of inactivity. If you specify a
                     value that is at the midpoint between two different  min-
                     utes,  the value is rounded up. For example, if you spec-
                     ify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes
                     of inactivity.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the  IAM  role that is applied to the fleet. To
                 assume a role, the fleet  instance  calls  the  AWS  Security
                 Token  Service  (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the
                 ARN of the role to use. The operation creates a  new  session
                 with  temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the tem-
                 porary credentials  and  creates  the  appstream_machine_role
                 credential profile on the instance.

                 For  more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permis-
                 sions to Applications and Scripts Running  on  AppStream  2.0
                 Streaming  Instances  in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administra-
                 tion Guide .

              StreamView -> (string)
                 The AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to your  users  when
                 they  stream  from the fleet. When APP is specified, only the
                 windows of applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP
                 is  specified,  the  standard desktop that is provided by the
                 operating system displays.

                 The default value is APP .

              Platform -> (string)
                 The platform of the fleet.

              MaxConcurrentSessions -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of concurrent sessions for the fleet.

              UsbDeviceFilterStrings -> (list)
                 The USB device filter strings associated with the fleet.

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
