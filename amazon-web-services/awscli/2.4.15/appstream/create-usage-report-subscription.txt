DESCRIPTION
       Creates a usage report subscription. Usage reports are generated daily.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-usage-report-subscription
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       S3BucketName -> (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket where generated reports are stored.

          If you enabled on-instance session scripts and Amazon S3 logging for
          your  session  script  configuration,  AppStream  2.0  created an S3
          bucket to store the script output. The  bucket  is  unique  to  your
          account  and  Region.  When you enable usage reporting in this case,
          AppStream 2.0 uses the same bucket to store your usage  reports.  If
          you  haven't  already  enabled on-instance session scripts, when you
          enable usage reports, AppStream 2.0 creates a new S3 bucket.

       Schedule -> (string)
          The schedule for generating usage reports.
