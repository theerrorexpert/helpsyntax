DESCRIBE-IMAGE-BUILDERS()                            DESCRIBE-IMAGE-BUILDERS()



NAME
       describe-image-builders -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list that describes one or more specified image builders,
       if the image builder names are provided. Otherwise, all image  builders
       in the account are described.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-image-builders  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ImageBuilders

SYNOPSIS
            describe-image-builders
          [--names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          The names of the image builders to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the image builder.
                 To  assume  a  role, the image builder calls the AWS Security
                 Token Service (STS) AssumeRole API operation and  passes  the
                 ARN  of  the role to use. The operation creates a new session
                 with temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the  tem-
                 porary  credentials  and  creates  the appstream_machine_role
                 credential profile on the instance.

                 For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant  Permis-
                 sions  to  Applications  and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0

                 tion Guide .

                     The state change reason message.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time stamp when the image builder was created.
