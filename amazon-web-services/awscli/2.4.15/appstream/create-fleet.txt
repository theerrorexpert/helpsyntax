          when  users  are connected and a small hourly fee for instances that
          are not streaming apps.

          Possible values:

          o ALWAYS_ON

          o ON_DEMAND

          o ELASTIC

       --compute-capacity (structure)
          The desired capacity for the fleet. This is not allowed for  Elastic
          fleets. For Elastic fleets, specify MaxConcurrentSessions instead.

          DesiredInstances -> (integer)
              The desired number of streaming instances.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DesiredInstances=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DesiredInstances": integer
          }

       --vpc-config (structure)
          The  VPC  configuration  for the fleet. This is required for Elastic
          fleets, but not required  for  other  fleet  types.  Elastic  fleets
          require  that  you  specify at least two subnets in different avail-
          ability zones.

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The identifiers of the subnets to which a network  interface  is
              attached  from  the  fleet  instance  or image builder instance.
              Fleet instances use one or more subnets. Image builder instances
              use one subnet.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The  identifiers  of  the security groups for the fleet or image
              builder.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetIds=string,string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --max-user-duration-in-seconds (integer)
          The maximum amount of time  that  a  streaming  session  can  remain
          active,  in  seconds.  If  users  are still connected to a streaming
          instance five  minutes  before  this  limit  is  reached,  they  are
          prompted to save any open documents before being disconnected. After
          this time elapses, the instance is terminated and replaced by a  new
          instance.

          Specify a value between 600 and 360000.

       --disconnect-timeout-in-seconds (integer)
          The  amount  of  time  that a streaming session remains active after
          users disconnect. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session
          after  a  disconnection  or  network  interruption  within this time
          interval, they are connected to their previous  session.  Otherwise,
          they are connected to a new session with a new streaming instance.

          Specify a value between 60 and 360000.

       --description (string)
          The description to display.

       --display-name (string)

       --enable-default-internet-access  | --no-enable-default-internet-access
       (boolean)
          Enables or disables default internet access for the fleet.

       --domain-join-info (structure)
          The name of the directory and organizational unit  (OU)  to  use  to
          join  the  fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain. This is not
          allowed for Elastic fleets.

          DirectoryName -> (string)
              The  fully  qualified  name  of  the  directory  (for   example,
              corp.example.com).

          OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)
              The  distinguished  name of the organizational unit for computer
              accounts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DirectoryName": "string",
            "OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          The tags to associate with the fleet. A tag is a key-value pair, and
          the  value is optional. For example, Environment=Test. If you do not
          specify a value, Environment=.

          If you do not specify a value, the value is set to an empty  string.

          Generally  allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces rep-
          resentable in UTF-8, and the following special characters:

          _ . : / = + - @

          For more information, see Tagging Your Resources in the Amazon  App-
          Stream 2.0 Administration Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --idle-disconnect-timeout-in-seconds (integer)
          The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they are
          disconnected from their streaming session  and  the  DisconnectTime-
          outInSeconds  time  interval  begins. Users are notified before they
          are disconnected due to inactivity. If they try to reconnect to  the
          streaming  session before the time interval specified in Disconnect-
          TimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are connected to their previous  ses-
          sion. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or
          mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads  and  down-
          loads,  audio  in,  audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as
          user activity. If users continue to be idle after the time  interval
          in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.

          To  prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify
          a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60  and  3600.  The
          default value is 0.

          NOTE:
              If  you  enable  this  feature,  we recommend that you specify a
              value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for
              example,  60,  120, and 180). If you don't do this, the value is
              rounded to the nearest minute. For example,  if  you  specify  a
              value  of  70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactiv-
              ity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between  two
              different  minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you
              specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of
              inactivity.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the IAM role to apply to the
          fleet. To assume a role, a fleet instance  calls  the  AWS  Security
          Token  Service  (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of
          the role to use. The operation creates a new session with  temporary
          credentials.  AppStream  2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and
          creates  the  appstream_machine_role  credential  profile   on   the
          instance.

          For  more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to
          Applications  and  Scripts  Running  on  AppStream   2.0   Streaming
          Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

       --stream-view (string)
          The  AppStream  2.0  view  that is displayed to your users when they
          stream from the fleet. When APP is specified, only  the  windows  of
          applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP is specified, the
          standard desktop that is provided by the operating system  displays.

          The default value is APP .

          Possible values:

          o APP

          o DESKTOP

       --platform (string)
          The  fleet  platform. WINDOWS_SERVER_2019 and AMAZON_LINUX2 are sup-
          ported for Elastic fleets.

          Possible values:

          o WINDOWS

          o WINDOWS_SERVER_2016

          o WINDOWS_SERVER_2019

          o AMAZON_LINUX2

       --max-concurrent-sessions (integer)
          The maximum concurrent  sessions  of  the  Elastic  fleet.  This  is
          required  for Elastic fleets, and not allowed for other fleet types.

       --usb-device-filter-strings (list)
          The USB device filter strings that specify which USB devices a  user
          can  redirect to the fleet streaming session, when using the Windows
          native client. This is allowed but not required for Elastic  fleets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              join the fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain.

              DirectoryName -> (string)
                 The  fully  qualified  name  of  the  directory (for example,
                 corp.example.com).

              OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)
                 The distinguished name of the organizational  unit  for  com-
                 puter accounts.

          IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they
              are disconnected from their streaming session  and  the  Discon-
              nectTimeoutInSeconds  time  interval  begins. Users are notified
              before they are disconnected due to inactivity. If users try  to
              reconnect  to  the  streaming  session  before the time interval
              specified in DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they  are  con-
              nected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when
              they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their stream-
              ing  session.  File  uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out,
              and pixels changing do not qualify as user  activity.  If  users
              continue  to  be idle after the time interval in IdleDisconnect-
              TimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.

              To prevent users from  being  disconnected  due  to  inactivity,
              specify  a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and
              3600. The default value is 0.

              NOTE:
                 If you enable this feature, we recommend that you  specify  a
                 value  that  corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes
                 (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't  do  this,  the
                 value  is  rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you
                 specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1  minute
                 of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint
                 between two different minutes, the value is rounded  up.  For
                 example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected
                 after 2 minutes of inactivity.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the fleet. To  assume
              a  role, the fleet instance calls the AWS Security Token Service
              (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of the role to
              use.  The operation creates a new session with temporary creden-
              tials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves  the  temporary  credentials  and
              creates  the  appstream_machine_role  credential  profile on the
              instance.

              For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions
              to  Applications  and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0 Streaming
              Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

          StreamView -> (string)
              The AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to your users when they
              stream  from  the fleet. When APP is specified, only the windows
              of applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP is  speci-
              fied,  the  standard  desktop  that is provided by the operating
              system displays.

              The default value is APP .

          Platform -> (string)
              The platform of the fleet.

          MaxConcurrentSessions -> (integer)
              The maximum number of concurrent sessions for the fleet.

          UsbDeviceFilterStrings -> (list)
              The USB device filter strings associated with the fleet.

              (string)



                                                                CREATE-FLEET()
