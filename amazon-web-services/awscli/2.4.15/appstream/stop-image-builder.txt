STOP-IMAGE-BUILDER()                                      STOP-IMAGE-BUILDER()



NAME
       stop-image-builder -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops the specified image builder.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-image-builder
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the image builder.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Platform -> (string)
              The operating system platform of the image builder.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the image builder. To
              assume  a  role,  the image builder calls the AWS Security Token
              Service (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of the
              role  to use. The operation creates a new session with temporary
              credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the  temporary  credentials
              and creates the appstream_machine_role credential profile on the
              instance.

              For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions
              to  Applications  and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0 Streaming
              Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

                 lets you create a private connection between the virtual pri-
                 vate cloud (VPC) that you specify and AppStream 2.0. When you
                 specify an interface endpoint for a stack, users of the stack
                 can connect to AppStream 2.0 only through that endpoint. When
                 you specify an  interface  endpoint  for  an  image  builder,
                 administrators  can connect to the image builder only through
                 that endpoint.
