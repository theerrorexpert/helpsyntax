DESCRIBE-APP-BLOCKS()                                    DESCRIBE-APP-BLOCKS()



NAME
       describe-app-blocks -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list that describes one or more app blocks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-app-blocks
          [--arns <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arns (list)
          The ARNs of the app blocks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The  pagination  token used to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of each page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AppBlocks -> (list)
          The app blocks in the list.

          (structure)
              Describes an app block.

              App blocks are an Amazon AppStream 2.0 resource that stores  the
              details  about  the  virtual  hard disk in an S3 bucket. It also
              stores the setup script with details about how to mount the vir-
              tual  hard  disk. The virtual hard disk includes the application
              binaries and other files necessary to launch your  applications.
              Multiple applications can be assigned to a single app block.

              This is only supported for Elastic fleets.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the app block.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the app block.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the app block.

              DisplayName -> (string)
                 The display name of the app block.

              SourceS3Location -> (structure)
                 The source S3 location of the app block.

                 S3Bucket -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The S3 key of the S3 object.

              SetupScriptDetails -> (structure)
                 The setup script details of the app block.

                 ScriptS3Location -> (structure)
                     The S3 object location for the script.

                     S3Bucket -> (string)
                        The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

                     S3Key -> (string)
                        The S3 key of the S3 object.

                 ExecutablePath -> (string)
                     The run path for the script.

                 ExecutableParameters -> (string)
                     The  runtime  parameters  passed  to the run path for the
                     script.

                 TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The run timeout, in seconds, for the script.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The created time of the app block.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token used to retrieve the next page of  results  for
          this operation.
