DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list that describes one or more application fleet associa-
       tions. Either ApplicationArn or FleetName must be specified.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-application-fleet-associations
          [--fleet-name <value>]
          [--application-arn <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-name (string)
          The name of the fleet.

       --application-arn (string)
          The ARN of the application.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of each page of results.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token used to retrieve the next page of  results  for
          this operation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationFleetAssociations -> (list)
          The application fleet associations in the list.

          (structure)
              Describes the application fleet association.

              FleetName -> (string)
                 The name of the fleet associated with the application.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the application associated with the fleet.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token used to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation.
