DESCRIBE-DIRECTORY-CONFIGS()                      DESCRIBE-DIRECTORY-CONFIGS()



NAME
       describe-directory-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list that describes one or more specified Directory Config
       objects for AppStream 2.0, if the names for these objects are provided.
       Otherwise,  all  Directory Config objects in the account are described.
       These objects include the configuration information  required  to  join
       fleets and image builders to Microsoft Active Directory domains.

       Although  the  response syntax in this topic includes the account pass-
       word, this password is not returned in the actual response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-directory-configs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: DirectoryConfigs

SYNOPSIS
            describe-directory-configs
          [--directory-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-names (list)
          The directory names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DirectoryConfigs -> (list)
          Information about the directory configurations. Note  that  although
          the  response  syntax  in  this topic includes the account password,
          this password is not returned in the actual response.

          (structure)
              Describes the configuration information required to join  fleets
              and image builders to Microsoft Active Directory domains.

              DirectoryName -> (string)
                 The  fully  qualified  name  of  the  directory (for example,
                 corp.example.com).

              OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedNames -> (list)
                 The distinguished names of the organizational units for  com-
                 puter accounts.

                 (string)

              ServiceAccountCredentials -> (structure)
                 The  credentials for the service account used by the fleet or
                 image builder to connect to the directory.

                 AccountName -> (string)
                     The user name of the account. This account must have  the
                     following  privileges: create computer objects, join com-
                     puters to the domain, and change/reset  the  password  on
                     descendant  computer objects for the organizational units
                     specified.

                 AccountPassword -> (string)
                     The password for the account.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the directory configuration was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
