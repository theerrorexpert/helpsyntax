CREATE-APP-BLOCK()                                          CREATE-APP-BLOCK()



NAME
       create-app-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an app block.

       App blocks are an Amazon AppStream 2.0 resource that stores the details
       about the virtual hard disk in an S3 bucket. It also stores  the  setup
       script  with details about how to mount the virtual hard disk. The vir-
       tual hard disk includes the application binaries and other files neces-
       sary to launch your applications. Multiple applications can be assigned
       to a single app block.

       This is only supported for Elastic fleets.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          }

       --setup-script-details (structure)
          The setup script details of the app block.

          ScriptS3Location -> (structure)
              The S3 object location for the script.

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

              S3Key -> (string)

          ExecutablePath -> (string)
              The run path for the script.

          ExecutableParameters -> (string)
              The runtime parameters passed to the run path for the script.

          TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              The run timeout, in seconds, for the script.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ScriptS3Location={S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string},ExecutablePath=string,ExecutableParameters=string,TimeoutInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ScriptS3Location": {
              "S3Bucket": "string",
              "S3Key": "string"
            },
            "ExecutablePath": "string",
            "ExecutableParameters": "string",
            "TimeoutInSeconds": integer
          }

       --tags (map)
          The tags assigned to the app block.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
