       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-entitlements
          [--name <value>]
          --stack-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the entitlement.

       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack with which the entitlement is associated.

       --next-token (string)
          The  pagination  token used to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of each page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Entitlements -> (list)
          The entitlements.

          (structure)
              Specifies an entitlement. Entitlements control  access  to  spe-
              cific  applications  within  a  stack, based on user attributes.
              Entitlements apply to SAML 2.0 federated user identities. Amazon
              AppStream  2.0 user pool and streaming URL users are entitled to
              all applications in a stack. Entitlements  don't  apply  to  the
              desktop stream view application, or to applications managed by a
              dynamic app provider using the Dynamic Application Framework.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the entitlement.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack with which the entitlement  is  associ-
                 ated.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the entitlement.

              AppVisibility -> (string)
                 Specifies whether all or selected apps are entitled.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 The attributes of the entitlement.

                 (structure)
                     An  attribute associated with an entitlement. Application
                     entitlements  work  by  matching  a  supported  SAML  2.0
                     attribute  name to a value when a user identity federates
                     to an Amazon AppStream 2.0 SAML application.

                     Name -> (string)
                        A supported AWS IAM SAML PrincipalTag  attribute  that
                        is  matched  to the associated value when a user iden-
                        tity federates  into  an  Amazon  AppStream  2.0  SAML
                        application.

                        The following are valid values:

                        o roles

                        o department

                        o organization

                        o groups

                        o title

                        o costCenter

                        o userType

                     Value -> (string)
                        A  value that is matched to a supported SAML attribute
                        name when a user identity  federates  into  an  Amazon
                        AppStream 2.0 SAML application.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the entitlement was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the entitlement was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token used to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation.
