SYNOPSIS
            batch-disassociate-user-stack
          --user-stack-associations <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-stack-associations (list)
          The list of UserStackAssociation objects.

          (structure)
              Describes a user in the user pool and the associated stack.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack that is associated with the user.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The  email  address  of  the  user who is associated with the
                 stack.

                 NOTE:
                     Users' email addresses are case-sensitive.

              AuthenticationType -> (string)
                 The authentication type for the user.

              SendEmailNotification -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether a welcome email is sent to a user after the
                 user is created in the user pool.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StackName=string,UserName=string,AuthenticationType=string,SendEmailNotification=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StackName": "string",
              "UserName": "string",
              "AuthenticationType": "API"|"SAML"|"USERPOOL",
              "SendEmailNotification": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       errors -> (list)
          The list of UserStackAssociationError objects.

          (structure)
              Describes the error that is returned when a user cant be associ-
              ated with or disassociated from a stack.

              UserStackAssociation -> (structure)
                 Information about the user and associated stack.

                 StackName -> (string)
                     The name of the stack that is associated with the user.

                 UserName -> (string)
                     The email address of the user who is associated with  the
                     stack.

                 The error code for the error that is  returned  when  a  user
                 cant be associated with or disassociated from a stack.
