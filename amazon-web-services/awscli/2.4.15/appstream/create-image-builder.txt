NAME
       create-image-builder -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an image builder. An image builder is a virtual machine that is
       used to create an image.

       The initial state of the builder is PENDING . When  it  is  ready,  the
       state is RUNNING .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       --description (string)
          The description to display.

       --display-name (string)
          The image builder name to display.

       --vpc-config (structure)
          The VPC configuration for the image builder. You  can  specify  only
          one subnet.

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The  identifiers  of the subnets to which a network interface is
              attached from the fleet  instance  or  image  builder  instance.
              Fleet instances use one or more subnets. Image builder instances
              use one subnet.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The identifiers of the security groups for the  fleet  or  image
              builder.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetIds=string,string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to apply to the image
          builder. To assume a role, the image builder calls the AWS  Security
          Token  Service  (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of
          the role to use. The operation creates a new session with  temporary
          credentials.  AppStream  2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and
          creates  the  appstream_machine_role  credential  profile   on   the
          instance.

          For  more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to
          Applications  and  Scripts  Running  on  AppStream   2.0   Streaming

          }

       --appstream-agent-version (string)
          The  version  of  the  AppStream  2.0  agent  to  use for this image

          _ . : / = + - @

          If you do not specify a value, the value is set to an empty  string.

          For  more  information about tags, see Tagging Your Resources in the
          Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

          key -> (string)

          (structure)
              Describes an interface VPC endpoint  (interface  endpoint)  that
              lets you create a private connection between the virtual private
              cloud (VPC) that you specify and AppStream 2.0. When you specify
              an  interface  endpoint for a stack, users of the stack can con-
              nect to AppStream 2.0 only through that endpoint. When you spec-
              ify  an  interface endpoint for an image builder, administrators
              can connect to the image builder only through that endpoint.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 The type of interface endpoint.

              VpceId -> (string)
                 The identifier (ID) of the VPC in which  the  interface  end-
                 point is used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointType=string,VpceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

              "VpceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
