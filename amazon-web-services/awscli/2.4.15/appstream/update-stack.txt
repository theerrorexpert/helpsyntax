              abled for users during their streaming sessions.

              fying the same settings group for each stack.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          specified endpoints.

          (structure)
              Describes an interface VPC endpoint  (interface  endpoint)  that
              lets you create a private connection between the virtual private
              cloud (VPC) that you specify and AppStream 2.0. When you specify
              an  interface  endpoint for a stack, users of the stack can con-
              nect to AppStream 2.0 only through that endpoint. When you spec-
              ify  an  interface endpoint for an image builder, administrators
              can connect to the image builder only through that endpoint.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 The type of interface endpoint.

              VpceId -> (string)
                 The identifier (ID) of the VPC in which  the  interface  end-
                 point is used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointType=string,VpceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EndpointType": "STREAMING",
              "VpceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --embed-host-domains (list)
          The  domains  where AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions can be embedded
          in an iframe. You must approve the domains that  you  want  to  host
          embedded AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions.

          (string)
              Specifies  a  valid domain that can embed AppStream. Valid exam-
              ples  include:  ["testorigin.tt--com",   "testingorigin.com.us",
              "test.com.us"]  Invalid  examples  include: ["test,com", ".com",
              "h*llo.com". ""]

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
