SYNOPSIS
            update-directory-config
          --directory-name <value>
          [--organizational-unit-distinguished-names <value>]
          [--service-account-credentials <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-name (string)
          The name of the Directory Config object.

       --organizational-unit-distinguished-names (list)
          The  distinguished  names  of  the organizational units for computer
          accounts.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --service-account-credentials (structure)
          The credentials for the service account used by the fleet  or  image
          builder to connect to the directory.

          AccountName -> (string)
              The user name of the account. This account must have the follow-
              ing privileges: create computer objects, join computers  to  the
              domain,  and  change/reset  the  password on descendant computer
              objects for the organizational units specified.

          AccountPassword -> (string)
              The password for the account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountName=string,AccountPassword=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountName": "string",
            "AccountPassword": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
