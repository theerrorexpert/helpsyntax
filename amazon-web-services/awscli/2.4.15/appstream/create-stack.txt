          SettingsGroup -> (string)
              The  path prefix for the S3 bucket where users persistent appli-
              cation settings are stored. You can allow  the  same  persistent

          the  value is optional. For example, Environment=Test. If you do not
          specify a value, Environment=.

          If you do not specify a value, the value is set to an empty  string.

          Generally  allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces rep-
          resentable in UTF-8, and the following special characters:

          _ . : / = + - @

          Users of the stack can connect to AppStream  2.0  only  through  the
          specified endpoints.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  interface  VPC endpoint (interface endpoint) that
              lets you create a private connection between the virtual private
              cloud (VPC) that you specify and AppStream 2.0. When you specify
              an interface endpoint for a stack, users of the stack  can  con-
              nect to AppStream 2.0 only through that endpoint. When you spec-
              ify an interface endpoint for an image  builder,  administrators
              can connect to the image builder only through that endpoint.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 The type of interface endpoint.

              VpceId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  (ID)  of the VPC in which the interface end-
                 point is used.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --embed-host-domains (list)
          The domains where AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions can  be  embedded
          in  an  iframe.  You  must approve the domains that you want to host
          embedded AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions.

          (string)
              Specifies a valid domain that can embed AppStream.  Valid  exam-
              ples   include:  ["testorigin.tt--com",  "testingorigin.com.us",
              "test.com.us"] Invalid examples  include:  ["test,com",  ".com",
              "h*llo.com". ""]

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
