DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()                                        DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()



NAME
       describe-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list that describes the streaming sessions for a specified
       stack and fleet. If a UserId is provided for the stack and fleet,  only
       streaming  sessions  for  that user are described. If an authentication
       type is not provided, the default is  to  authenticate  users  using  a
       streaming URL.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-sessions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Sessions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-sessions
          --stack-name <value>
          --fleet-name <value>
          [--user-id <value>]
          [--authentication-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack. This value is case-sensitive.

       --fleet-name (string)
          The name of the fleet. This value is case-sensitive.

       --user-id (string)
          The user identifier (ID). If you specify a user ID,  you  must  also
          specify the authentication type.

       --authentication-type (string)
          The  authentication  method.  Specify  API  for a user authenticated
          using a streaming URL or SAML for a SAML federated user. The default
          is to authenticate users using a streaming URL.

          Possible values:

          o API

          o SAML

          o USERPOOL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Sessions -> (list)
          Information about the streaming sessions.

          (structure)
              Describes a streaming session.

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the streaming session.

              UserId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the user for whom the session was  created.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack for the streaming session.

              FleetName -> (string)
                 The name of the fleet for the streaming session.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the streaming session.

              ConnectionState -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  a user is connected to the streaming ses-
                 sion.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when a streaming instance is dedicated for the user.

              MaxExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when  the streaming session is set to expire. This
                 time is based on the  MaxUserDurationinSeconds  value,  which
                 determines  the  maximum length of time that a streaming ses-
                 sion can run. A streaming session might end earlier than  the
                 time specified in SessionMaxExpirationTime , when the Discon-
                 nectTimeOutInSeconds elapses or the user chooses to  end  his
                 or her session. If the DisconnectTimeOutInSeconds elapses, or
                 the user chooses to end his or  her  session,  the  streaming
                 instance is terminated and the streaming session ends.

              AuthenticationType -> (string)
                 The  authentication method. The user is authenticated using a
                 streaming URL (API ) or SAML 2.0 federation (SAML ).

              NetworkAccessConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The network details for the streaming session.

                 EniPrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                     The private IP address of the elastic  network  interface
                     that is attached to instances in your VPC.

                 EniId -> (string)
                     The  resource identifier of the elastic network interface
                     that is attached to instances in your  VPC.  All  network
                     interfaces have the eni-xxxxxxxx resource identifier.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
