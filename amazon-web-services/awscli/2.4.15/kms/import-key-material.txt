IMPORT-KEY-MATERIAL()                                    IMPORT-KEY-MATERIAL()



NAME
       import-key-material -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  key  material  into an existing symmetric KMS KMS key that was
       created without key material. After you successfully import  key  mate-
       rial  into  a KMS key, you can reimport the same key material into that
       KMS key, but you cannot import different key material.

       You cannot perform this operation on an asymmetric KMS key  or  on  any
       KMS  key  in a different Amazon Web Services account. For more informa-
       tion about creating KMS keys with no key material  and  then  importing
       key  material, see Importing Key Material in the Key Management Service
       Developer Guide .

       Before  using  this  operation,  call   GetParametersForImport  .   Its
       response  includes a public key and an import token. Use the public key
       to encrypt the key material. Then, submit the  import  token  from  the
       same GetParametersForImport response.

       When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:

       o The  key  ID or key ARN of a KMS key with no key material. Its Origin
         must be EXTERNAL . To create a KMS key with  no  key  material,  call
         CreateKey  and set the value of its Origin parameter to EXTERNAL . To
         get the Origin of a KMS key, call  DescribeKey .)

       o The encrypted key material. To get the public key to encrypt the  key
         material, call  GetParametersForImport .

       o The  import token that  GetParametersForImport returned. You must use
         a public key and token from the same GetParametersForImport response.

       o Whether the key material expires and if so, when. If you set an expi-
         ration date, KMS deletes the key material from the  KMS  key  on  the
         specified  date, and the KMS key becomes unusable. To use the KMS key
         again, you must reimport the same  key  material.  The  only  way  to
         change an expiration date is by reimporting the same key material and
         specifying a new expiration date.

       When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes
       from PendingImport to Enabled , and you can use the KMS key.

       If  this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the prob-
       lem. If the error is related to the key material, the import token,  or
       wrapping  key,  use  GetParametersForImport to get a new public key and
       import token for the KMS key and repeat the import procedure. For help,
       see  How To Import Key Material in the Key Management Service Developer
       Guide .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key state: Effect on your KMS key in the Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on  a  KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

SYNOPSIS
            import-key-material
          --key-id <value>
          --import-token <value>
          --encrypted-key-material <value>
          [--valid-to <value>]
          [--expiration-model <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the symmetric KMS key that receives the imported
          key material. The KMS key's Origin must be EXTERNAL . This  must  be
          the same KMS key specified in the KeyID parameter of the correspond-
          ing  GetParametersForImport request.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN  for  a  KMS  key,  use   ListKeys  or
          DescribeKey .

       --import-token (blob)
          The  import  token  that  you received in the response to a previous
          GetParametersForImport request. It must be from  the  same  response
          that contained the public key that you used to encrypt the key mate-
          rial.

       --encrypted-key-material (blob)
          The encrypted key material to  import.  The  key  material  must  be
          encrypted  with the public wrapping key that  GetParametersForImport
          returned, using the wrapping algorithm that  you  specified  in  the
          same GetParametersForImport request.

       --valid-to (timestamp)
          The  time  at  which the imported key material expires. When the key
          material expires, KMS deletes the  key  material  and  the  KMS  key
          becomes  unusable. You must omit this parameter when the Expiration-
          Model parameter is set to KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE  .  Otherwise
          it is required.

       --expiration-model (string)
          Specifies whether the key material expires. The default is KEY_MATE-
          RIAL_EXPIRES , in which case you must include the ValidTo parameter.
          When  this  parameter  is  set to KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE , you
          must omit the ValidTo parameter.

          Possible values:

          o KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES

          o KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To import key material into a KMS customer master key

       The following import-key-material example uploads key material  into  a
       CMK  that  was  created  with no key material. The key state of the CMK
       must be PendingImport.

       This command uses key material that you encrypted with the  public  key
       that  the  get-parameters-for-import command returned. It also uses the
       import token from the same get-parameters-for-import command.

       The expiration-model parameter indicates that the key material automat-
       ically  expires  on the date and time specified by the valid-to parame-
       ter. When the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the  key  material,
       the  key state of the CMK changes to Pending import and the CMK becomes
       unusable. To restore the CMK, you must reimport the same key  material.
       To use different key material, you must create a new CMK.

       Before  running  this  command, replace the example key ID with a valid
       key ID or key ARN from your AWS account.

          aws kms import-key-material \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --encrypted-key-material fileb://EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin \
              --import-token fileb://ImportToken.bin \
              --expiration-model KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES \
              --valid-to 2021-09-21T19:00:00Z

       This command produces no output.

       Material in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
