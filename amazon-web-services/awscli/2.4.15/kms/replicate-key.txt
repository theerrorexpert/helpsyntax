REPLICATE-KEY()                                                REPLICATE-KEY()



NAME
       replicate-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation
       creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary  key
       in  a  different  Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You
       can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must  be  in  a
       different  Region.  To create a multi-Region primary key, use the  Cre-
       ateKey operation.

       This operation supports multi-Region keys , an KMS  feature  that  lets
       you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID,  key  mate-
       rial,  and  other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt
       data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it  in  a  different
       Amazon  Web  Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a
       cross-Region call. For more information about  multi-Region  keys,  see
       Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       A replica key is a fully-functional KMS key that can be  used  indepen-
       dently  of  its  primary  and  peer replica keys. A primary key and its
       replica keys share properties that make them interoperable.  They  have
       the  same  key  ID and key material. They also have the same key spec ,
       key usage , key material origin , and automatic key rotation  status  .
       KMS  automatically  synchronizes  these shared properties among related
       multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica  key  can  differ,
       including its key policy , tags , aliases , and key state . KMS pricing
       and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key.

       When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient  key
       state of Creating . This key state changes to Enabled (or PendingImport
       ) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica  key
       is  complete. While the key state is Creating , you can manage key, but
       you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are  creating
       and using the replica key programmatically, retry on KMSInvalidStateEx-
       ception or call DescribeKey to check its KeyState  value  before  using
       it.  For details about the Creating key state, see Key state: Effect on
       your KMS key in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       The CloudTrail log of a ReplicateKey operation records  a  ReplicateKey
       operation in the primary key's Region and a  CreateKey operation in the
       replica key's Region.

       If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material,
       the  replica  key  is created with no key material. You must import the
       same key material that you imported into the primary key. For  details,
       see Importing key material into multi-Region keys in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .

       To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the  UpdatePrimaryRegion
       operation.

       NOTE:
              ReplicateKey uses different default values for the KeyPolicy and
              Tags parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details,
              see the parameter descriptions.

          Cross-account  use  :  No. You cannot use this operation to create a
          replica key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions :

       o kms:ReplicateKey on the primary key (in the  primary  key's  Region).
         Include this permission in the primary key's key policy.

       o kms:CreateKey in an IAM policy in the replica Region.

       o To  use  the  Tags parameter, kms:TagResource in an IAM policy in the
         replica Region.

SYNOPSIS
            replicate-key
          --key-id <value>
          --replica-region <value>
          [--policy <value>]
          [--bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check | --no-bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check]
          [--description <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies the multi-Region primary key that is being replicated. To
          determine  whether  a KMS key is a multi-Region primary key, use the
          DescribeKey operation to check the value of  the  MultiRegionKeyType
          property.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of a multi-Region primary key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          To  get  the  key  ID  and  key  ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or
          DescribeKey .

       --replica-region (string)
          The Region ID of the Amazon Web Services  Region  for  this  replica
          key.

          Enter  the  Region  ID,  such as us-east-1 or ap-southeast-2 . For a
          list of Amazon Web Services Regions in which KMS is  supported,  see
          KMS service endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          The replica must be in a different Amazon Web Services  Region  than
          its  primary  key and other replicas of that primary key, but in the
          same Amazon Web Services partition. KMS must  be  available  in  the
          replica  Region. If the Region is not enabled by default, the Amazon
          Web Services account must be enabled in the Region.

          For information about Amazon Web  Services  partitions,  see  Amazon
          Resource Names (ARNs) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*
          . For information about enabling and disabling Regions, see Enabling
          a  Region  and Disabling a Region in the Amazon Web Services General
          Reference .

       --policy (string)
          The key policy to attach to the KMS key. This parameter is optional.
          If  you  do  not  provide a key policy, KMS attaches the default key
          policy to the KMS key.

          The key policy is not a shared property of  multi-Region  keys.  You
          can  specify  the same key policy or a different key policy for each
          key in a set of related multi-Region keys. KMS does not  synchronize
          this property.

          If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:

          o If  you  don't set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true, the key
            policy must give the caller  kms:PutKeyPolicy  permission  on  the
            replica key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unman-
            ageable. For more  information,  refer  to  the  scenario  in  the
            Default  Key Policy section of the * Key Management Service Devel-
            oper Guide * .

          o Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more  princi-
            pals.  The  principals in the key policy must exist and be visible
            to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services  principal  (for
            example,  an  IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay
            before including the new principal in a key policy because the new
            principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more infor-
            mation, see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible
            in the * Identity and Access Management User Guide * .

          o The key policy size quota is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).

       --bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check     |     --no-bypass-policy-lock-
       out-safety-check (boolean)
          A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy  lockout  safety
          check.

          WARNING:
              Setting  this  value to true increases the risk that the KMS key
              becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true  indiscrimi-
              nately.

              For  more  information, refer to the scenario in the Default Key
              Policy section in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          Use this parameter only when you intend  to  prevent  the  principal
          that  is  making  the  request from making a subsequent PutKeyPolicy
          request on the KMS key.

          The default value is false.

       --description (string)
          A description of the KMS key. The default value is an  empty  string
          (no description).

          The  description  is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You
          can specify the same description or a different description for each
          key  in a set of related multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize
          this property.

       --tags (list)
          Assigns one or more tags to the replica key. Use this  parameter  to
          tag  the KMS key when it is created. To tag an existing KMS key, use
          the  TagResource operation.

          NOTE:
              Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny  permission  to
              the  KMS key. For details, see Using ABAC in KMS in the Key Man-
              agement Service Developer Guide .

          To use this parameter, you must have kms:TagResource  permission  in
          an IAM policy.

          Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify
          the same tags or different tags for each key in  a  set  of  related
          multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize this property.

          Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and
          the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null)
          string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same
          tag key. If you specify an existing tag key  with  a  different  tag
          value, KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.

          When  you  add  tags  to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web
          Services generates a cost allocation report  with  usage  and  costs
          aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS
          key. For details, see Tagging Keys .

          (structure)
              A key-value pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a  tag  value.
              Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be
              empty (null) strings.

              For information about the rules that apply to tag keys  and  tag
              values, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions in the Amazon Web Ser-
              vices Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              TagValue -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagKey=string,TagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TagKey": "string",
              "TagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ReplicaKeyMetadata -> (structure)
          Displays details about the new replica  key,  including  its  Amazon
          Resource  Name  (key  ARN ) and key state . It also includes the ARN
          and Amazon Web Services Region of its primary key and other  replica
          keys.

          AWSAccountId -> (string)
              The  twelve-digit  account ID of the Amazon Web Services account
              that owns the KMS key.

          KeyId -> (string)
              The globally unique identifier for the KMS key.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key. For examples, see
              Key  Management Service (KMS) in the Example ARNs section of the
              Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the KMS key was created.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the KMS  key  is  enabled.  When  KeyState  is
              Enabled this value is true, otherwise it is false.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the KMS key.

          KeyUsage -> (string)
              The  cryptographic operations for which you can use the KMS key.

          KeyState -> (string)
              The current status of the KMS key.

              For more information about how key state affects the  use  of  a
              KMS  key,  see Key state: Effect on your KMS key in the Key Man-
              agement Service Developer Guide .

          DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time after which KMS deletes  this  KMS  key.  This
              value  is  present  only when the KMS key is scheduled for dele-
              tion, that is, when its KeyState is PendingDeletion .

              When the primary key in a  multi-Region  key  is  scheduled  for
              deletion  but  still  has replica keys, its key state is Pendin-
              gReplicaDeletion and the length of its waiting  period  is  dis-
              played in the PendingDeletionWindowInDays field.

          ValidTo -> (timestamp)
              The  time  at  which the imported key material expires. When the
              key material expires, KMS deletes the key material and  the  KMS
              key  becomes  unusable.  This value is present only for KMS keys
              whose Origin is EXTERNAL and whose ExpirationModel is  KEY_MATE-
              RIAL_EXPIRES , otherwise this value is omitted.

          Origin -> (string)
              The  source of the key material for the KMS key. When this value
              is AWS_KMS , KMS created the key material. When  this  value  is
              EXTERNAL  , the key material was imported or the KMS key doesn't
              have any key material. When this value is AWS_CLOUDHSM , the key
              material  was  created in the CloudHSM cluster associated with a
              custom key store.

          CustomKeyStoreId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the custom key store that  contains  the
              KMS  key. This value is present only when the KMS key is created
              in a custom key store.

          CloudHsmClusterId -> (string)
              The cluster ID of the CloudHSM cluster  that  contains  the  key
              material  for the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in a custom
              key store , KMS creates the key material for the KMS key in  the
              associated CloudHSM cluster. This value is present only when the
              KMS key is created in a custom key store.

          ExpirationModel -> (string)
              Specifies whether the KMS key's key material expires. This value
              is  present  only when Origin is EXTERNAL , otherwise this value
              is omitted.

          KeyManager -> (string)
              The manager of the KMS key. KMS keys in your Amazon Web Services
              account  are either customer managed or Amazon Web Services man-
              aged. For more information about the difference, see KMS keys in
              the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          CustomerMasterKeySpec -> (string)
              Instead, use the KeySpec field.

              The  KeySpec  and  CustomerMasterKeySpec  fields  have  the same
              value. We recommend that you use the KeySpec field in your code.
              However,  to  avoid  breaking  changes,  KMS  will  support both
              fields.

          KeySpec -> (string)
              Describes the type of key material in the KMS key.

          EncryptionAlgorithms -> (list)
              The encryption algorithms that the KMS key supports. You  cannot
              use the KMS key with other encryption algorithms within KMS.

              This  value  is present only when the KeyUsage of the KMS key is
              ENCRYPT_DECRYPT .

              (string)

          SigningAlgorithms -> (list)
              The signing algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot use
              the KMS key with other signing algorithms within KMS.

              This  field  appears  only  when  the KeyUsage of the KMS key is
              SIGN_VERIFY .

              (string)

          MultiRegion -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the KMS key  is  a  multi-Region  (True  )  or
              regional  (False ) key. This value is True for multi-Region pri-
              mary and replica keys and False for regional KMS keys.

              For  more  information  about  multi-Region  keys,   see   Using
              multi-Region  keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide
              .

          MultiRegionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Lists the primary and replica keys  in  same  multi-Region  key.
              This  field  is  present  only when the value of the MultiRegion
              field is True .

              For  more  information  about  any  listed  KMS  key,  use   the
              DescribeKey operation.

              o MultiRegionKeyType  indicates whether the KMS key is a PRIMARY
                or REPLICA key.

              o PrimaryKey displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key.
                This  field  displays the current KMS key if it is the primary
                key.

              o ReplicaKeys displays the key ARNs and Regions of  all  replica
                keys.  This  field  includes  the  current  KMS key if it is a
                replica key.

              MultiRegionKeyType -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the KMS key is a PRIMARY or REPLICA key.

              PrimaryKey -> (structure)
                 Displays the key ARN and Region  of  the  primary  key.  This
                 field  includes the current KMS key if it is the primary key.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     Displays the key ARN of a primary or  replica  key  of  a
                     multi-Region key.

                 Region -> (string)
                     Displays  the  Amazon Web Services Region of a primary or
                     replica key in a multi-Region key.

              ReplicaKeys -> (list)
                 displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica  keys.  This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is a replica key.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the  primary  or replica key in a multi-Region
                     key.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of  a
                        multi-Region key.

                     Region -> (string)
                        Displays  the  Amazon Web Services Region of a primary
                        or replica key in a multi-Region key.

          PendingDeletionWindowInDays -> (integer)
              The waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region  key
              is  deleted.  This  waiting  period  begins when the last of its
              replica keys is deleted. This value is  present  only  when  the
              KeyState  of  the KMS key is PendingReplicaDeletion . That indi-
              cates that the KMS key is the primary key in a multi-Region key,
              it  is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing replica
              keys.

              When a single-Region KMS key or a multi-Region  replica  key  is
              scheduled  for  deletion,  its deletion date is displayed in the
              DeletionDate  field.  However,  when  the  primary  key   in   a
              multi-Region  key  is scheduled for deletion, its waiting period
              doesn't begin until all of its replica keys  are  deleted.  This
              value displays that waiting period. When the last replica key in
              the multi-Region key is deleted, the KeyState of  the  scheduled
              primary  key changes from PendingReplicaDeletion to PendingDele-
              tion and the deletion date appears in the DeletionDate field.

       ReplicaPolicy -> (string)
          The key policy of the new replica key. The value  is  a  key  policy
          document in JSON format.

       ReplicaTags -> (list)
          The  tags on the new replica key. The value is a list of tag key and
          tag value pairs.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a  tag  value.
              Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be
              empty (null) strings.

              For information about the rules that apply to tag keys  and  tag
              values, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions in the Amazon Web Ser-
              vices Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              TagValue -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.
