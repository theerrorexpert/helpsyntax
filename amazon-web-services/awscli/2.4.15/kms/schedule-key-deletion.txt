SCHEDULE-KEY-DELETION()                                SCHEDULE-KEY-DELETION()



NAME
       schedule-key-deletion -

DESCRIPTION
       Schedules  the deletion of a KMS key. By default, KMS applies a waiting
       period of 30 days, but you can specify a waiting period of  7-30  days.
       When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes
       to PendingDeletion and the key can't be used in any cryptographic oper-
       ations.  It  remains  in  this  state  for  the duration of the waiting
       period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use   CancelKeyDeletion
       to  cancel  the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends,
       KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all KMS data  associated
       with it, including all aliases that refer to it.

       WARNING:
          Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous opera-
          tion. When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was  encrypted  under
          the  KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a multi-Region
          replica key.) To prevent the use of a KMS key without  deleting  it,
          use  DisableKey .

       If  you  schedule  deletion of a KMS key from a custom key store , when
       the waiting period expires, ScheduleKeyDeletion  deletes  the  KMS  key
       from  KMS. Then KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from
       the associated CloudHSM cluster. However, you might  need  to  manually
       delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups.

       You  can  schedule  the  deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its
       replica keys at any time. However, KMS will not delete  a  multi-Region
       primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of
       a primary key with replicas, its key  state  changes  to  PendingRepli-
       caDeletion  and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic opera-
       tions. This status can continue indefinitely.  When  the  last  of  its
       replicas  keys  is  deleted  (not just scheduled), the key state of the
       primary key changes to PendingDeletion and its waiting period (Pending-
       WindowInDays  )  begins. For details, see Deleting multi-Region keys in
       the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       For more information about scheduling  a  KMS  key  for  deletion,  see
       Deleting KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key  in  the  Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use  : No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

SYNOPSIS
            schedule-key-deletion
          --key-id <value>
          [--pending-window-in-days <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the KMS key to delete.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN  for  a  KMS  key,  use   ListKeys  or
          DescribeKey .

       --pending-window-in-days (integer)
          The  waiting  period, specified in number of days. After the waiting
          period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key.

          If the KMS key is a multi-Region  primary  key  with  replicas,  the
          waiting  period begins when the last of its replica keys is deleted.
          Otherwise, the waiting period begins immediately.

          This value is optional. If you include a value, it must be between 7
          and 30, inclusive. If you do not include a value, it defaults to 30.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To schedule the deletion of a customer managed CMK.

       The following schedule-key-deletion  example  schedules  the  specified
       customer managed CMK to be deleted in 15 days.

       o The  --key-id  parameter  identifies the CMK. This example uses a key
         ARN value, but you can use either the key ID or the ARN of the CMK.

       o The --pending-window-in-days parameter specifies the  length  of  the
         waiting period. By default, the waiting period is 30 days. This exam-
         ple specifies a value of 15, which tells AWS  to  permanently  delete
         the CMK 15 days after the command completes.

            aws kms schedule-key-deletion \
                --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
                --pending-window-in-days 15

       The response returns the key ARN and the deletion date in Unix time. To
       view the deletion date in local time, use the AWS KMS console.

          {
              "KeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
              "DeletionDate": 1567382400.0
          }

       Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       KeyId -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (key ARN ) of the KMS key whose deletion is
          scheduled.

       DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time after which KMS deletes the KMS key.

          If the KMS key is a multi-Region primary key with replica keys, this
          field  does  not appear. The deletion date for the primary key isn't
          known until its last replica key is deleted.

       KeyState -> (string)
          The current status of the KMS key.

          For more information about how key state affects the use  of  a  KMS
          key,  see  Key  state:  Effect on your KMS key in the Key Management
          Service Developer Guide .

       PendingWindowInDays -> (integer)
          The waiting period before the KMS key is deleted.

          If the KMS key is a multi-Region  primary  key  with  replicas,  the
          waiting  period begins when the last of its replica keys is deleted.
          Otherwise, the waiting period begins immediately.
