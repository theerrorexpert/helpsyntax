SYNOPSIS
            put-key-policy
          --key-id <value>
          --policy-name <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check | --no-bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Sets the key policy on the specified KMS key.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the  key  ID  and  key  ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or
          DescribeKey .

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the key policy. The only valid value is default .

       --policy (string)
          The key policy to attach to the KMS key.

          The key policy must meet the following criteria:

          o If you don't set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true,  the  key
            policy  must  allow  the principal that is making the PutKeyPolicy
            request to make a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request on the KMS  key.
            This  reduces  the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For
            more information, refer to the scenario in the Default Key  Policy
            section of the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          o Each  statement in the key policy must contain one or more princi-
            pals. The principals in the key policy must exist and  be  visible
            to  KMS.  When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal (for
            example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce  a  delay
            before including the new principal in a key policy because the new
            principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more infor-
            mation, see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible
            in the Amazon Web Services Identity  and  Access  Management  User
            Guide .

          The  key  policy  cannot exceed 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes). For more
          information, see Resource  Quotas  in  the  Key  Management  Service
          Developer Guide .

       --bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check     |     --no-bypass-policy-lock-
       out-safety-check (boolean)
          A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy  lockout  safety
          check.

          WARNING:
              Setting  this  value to true increases the risk that the KMS key
              becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true  indiscrimi-
              nately.

              For  more  information, refer to the scenario in the Default Key
              Policy section in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          Use this parameter only when you intend  to  prevent  the  principal
          that  is  making  the  request from making a subsequent PutKeyPolicy
          request on the KMS key.

          The default value is false.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change the key policy for a customer master key (CMK)

       The following put-key-policy example changes the key policy for a  cus-
       tomer managed CMK.

       To begin, create a key policy and save it in a local JSON file. In this
       example, the file is key_policy.json. You can also specify the key pol-
       icy as a string value of the policy parameter.

       The first statement in this key policy gives the AWS account permission
       to use IAM policies to control access to the CMK. The second  statement
       gives  the  test-user  user  permission  to  run  the  describe-key and
       list-keys commands on the CMK.

       Contents of key_policy.json:

          {
              "Version" : "2012-10-17",
              "Id" : "key-default-1",
              "Statement" : [
                  {
                      "Sid" : "Enable IAM User Permissions",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
                      },
                      "Action" : "kms:",
                      "Resource" : "*"
                  },
                  {
                      "Sid" : "Allow Use of Key",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/test-user"
                      },
                      "Action" : [
                          "kms:DescribeKey",
                          "kms:ListKeys"
                      ],
                      "Resource" : "*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       To identify the CMK, this example uses the key ID, but you can also usa
       key ARN. To specify the key policy, the command uses the policy parame-
       ter. To indicate that the policy is in a file,  it  uses  the  required
       file://  prefix.  This prefix is required to identify files on all sup-
       ported operating systems. Finally, the  command  uses  the  policy-name
       parameter  with  a  value  of default. This parameter is required, even
       though default is the only valid value.

          aws kms put-key-policy \
              --policy-name default \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --policy file://key_policy.json

       This command does not produce any output. To verify  that  the  command
       was  effective,  use  the get-key-policy command. The following example
       command gets the key policy for the same CMK. The output parameter with
       a value of text returns a text format that is easy to read.

          aws kms get-key-policy \
              --policy-name default \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --output text

       Output:

          {
              "Version" : "2012-10-17",
              "Id" : "key-default-1",
              "Statement" : [
                  {
                      "Sid" : "Enable IAM User Permissions",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
                      },
                      "Action" : "kms:",
                      "Resource" : "*"
                      },
                      {
                      "Sid" : "Allow Use of Key",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/test-user"
                      },
                      "Action" : [ "kms:Describe", "kms:List" ],
                      "Resource" : "*"
                  }
              ]
          }
