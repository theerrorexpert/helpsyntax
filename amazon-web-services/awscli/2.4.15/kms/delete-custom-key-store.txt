DELETE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()                            DELETE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()



NAME
       delete-custom-key-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  custom  key  store  .  This  operation  does not delete the
       CloudHSM cluster that is associated  with  the  custom  key  store,  or
       affect any users or keys in the cluster.

       The  custom key store that you delete cannot contain any KMS KMS keys .
       Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need  to  use
       any of the KMS keys in the key store for any cryptographic operations .
       Then, use  ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the  KMS  keys  from  the  key
       store.  When the scheduled waiting period expires, the ScheduleKeyDele-
       tion operation deletes the KMS keys. Then it makes  a  best  effort  to
       delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might
       need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster  and
       its backups.

       After  all KMS keys are deleted from KMS, use  DisconnectCustomKeyStore
       to disconnect the key store from KMS. Then, you can delete  the  custom
       key store.

       Instead  of  deleting the custom key store, consider using  Disconnect-
       CustomKeyStore to disconnect it from KMS. While the key store  is  dis-
       connected, you cannot create or use the KMS keys in the key store. But,
       you do not need to delete KMS keys and you can reconnect a disconnected
       custom key store at any time.

       If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

       This operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in  KMS,
       which  combines  the  convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
       the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a  cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:DeleteCustomKeyStore (IAM policy)

SYNOPSIS
            delete-custom-key-store
          --custom-key-store-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Enter the ID of the custom key store you want to delete. To find the
          ID of a custom key store, use  the   DescribeCustomKeyStores  opera-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a custom key store

       The  following  delete-custom-key-store  example  deletes the specified
       custom key store. This command doesn't have any effect on  the  associ-
       ated CloudHSM cluster.

       NOTE:  Before  you can delete a custom key store, you must schedule the
       deletion of all CMKs in the custom key store and then  wait  for  those
       CMKs to be deleted. Then, you must disconnect the custom key store.

          delete-custom-key-store \
              --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0

       This  command does not return any output. To verify that the custom key
       store is deleted, use the describe-custom-key-stores command.

       Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
