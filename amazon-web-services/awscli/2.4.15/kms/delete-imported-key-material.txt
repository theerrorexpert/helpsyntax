DELETE-IMPORTED-KEY-MATERIAL()                  DELETE-IMPORTED-KEY-MATERIAL()



NAME
       delete-imported-key-material -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes key material that you previously imported. This operation makes
       the specified KMS key unusable. For more  information  about  importing
       key material into KMS, see Importing Key Material in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .

       When the specified KMS key is in the PendingDeletion state, this opera-
       tion does not change the KMS key's state. Otherwise, it changes the KMS
       key's state to PendingImport .

       After you delete key material, you can use  ImportKeyMaterial to  reim-
       port the same key material into the KMS key.

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key  in  the  Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use  : No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-imported-key-material
          --key-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies the KMS key from which  you  are  deleting  imported  key
          material. The Origin of the KMS key must be EXTERNAL .

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the  key  ID  and  key  ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or
          DescribeKey .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete imported key material from a customer master key (CMK)

       The following delete-imported-key-material example deletes key material
       that  had  been imported into a CMK. To specify the CMK, use the key-id
       parameter. This example uses an key ID value, but you can use a key  ID
       or key ARN value in this command.

       Before  running  this  command, replace the example key ID with a valid
       one.

          aws kms delete-imported-key-material \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This command produces no output. To verify that  the  key  material  is
       deleted,  use  the  describe-key  command  to  look  for a key state of
       PendingImport or PendingDeletion.
