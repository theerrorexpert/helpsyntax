LIST-GRANTS()                                                    LIST-GRANTS()



NAME
       list-grants -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of all grants for the specified KMS key.

       You  must specify the KMS key in all requests. You can filter the grant
       list by grant ID or grantee principal.

       For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see
       Using  grants  in  the * Key Management Service Developer Guide * . For
       examples of working with grants in several programming  languages,  see
       Programming grants .

       NOTE:
              The  GranteePrincipal  field  in the ListGrants response usually
              contains the user or role designated as the grantee principal in
              the  grant.  However, when the grantee principal in the grant is
              an Amazon Web Services service, the GranteePrincipal field  con-
              tains the service principal , which might represent several dif-
              ferent grantee principals.

          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a
          different  Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the key ARN in the
          value of the KeyId parameter.

          Required permissions : kms:ListGrants (key policy)

       list-grants is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Grants

SYNOPSIS
            list-grants
          --key-id <value>
          [--grant-id <value>]
          [--grantee-principal <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Returns  only  grants  for  the specified KMS key. This parameter is
          required.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key. To specify a  KMS  key
          in  a  different  Amazon  Web Services account, you must use the key
          ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN  for  a  KMS  key,  use   ListKeys  or
          DescribeKey .

       --grant-id (string)
          Returns  only  the  grant  with the specified grant ID. The grant ID
          uniquely identifies the grant.

       --grantee-principal (string)
          Returns only grants where the specified  principal  is  the  grantee
          principal for the grant.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view the grants on an AWS CMK

       The following list-grants example displays all of  the  grants  on  the
       specified  AWS  managed  CMK  for Amazon DynamoDB in your account. This
       grant allows DynamoDB to use the  CMK  on  your  behalf  to  encrypt  a
       DynamoDB  table  before  writing it to disk. You can use a command like
       this one to view the grants on the AWS managed CMKs and  customer  man-
       aged CMKs in the AWS account and Region.

       This  command  uses  the key-id parameter with a key ID to identify the
       CMK. You can use a key ID or key ARN to identify the CMK.  To  get  the
       key  ID  or  key  ARN  of  an  AWS  managed  CMK,  use the list-keys or
       list-aliases command.

          aws kms list-grants \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       The output shows that the grant gives Amazon DynamoDB permission to use
       the  CMK  for cryptographic operations, and gives it permission to view
       details about the CMK (DescribeKey) and to retire grants (RetireGrant).
       The  EncryptionContextSubset  constraint  limits  these  permission  to
       requests that include the specified  encryption  context  pairs.  As  a
       result,  the  permissions  in the grant are effective only on specified
       account and DynamoDB table.

OUTPUT
       Grants -> (list)
          A list of grants.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a grant.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  for  the  KMS key to which the grant
                 applies.

              GrantId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the grant.

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name that identifies the grant. If  a  name  was
                 provided  in the  CreateGrant request, that name is returned.
                 Otherwise this value is null.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the grant was created.

              GranteePrincipal -> (string)
                 The identity that gets the permissions in the grant.

                 The GranteePrincipal field in the ListGrants response usually
                 contains the user or role designated as the grantee principal
                 in the grant. However, when  the  grantee  principal  in  the
                 grant is an Amazon Web Services service, the GranteePrincipal
                 field contains the service principal , which might  represent
                 several different grantee principals.

              RetiringPrincipal -> (string)
                 The principal that can retire the grant.

              IssuingAccount -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  account under which the grant was
                 issued.

              Operations -> (list)
                 The list of operations permitted by the grant.

                 (string)

              Constraints -> (structure)
                 A list of key-value pairs that must be present in the encryp-
                 tion  context of certain subsequent operations that the grant
                 allows.

                 EncryptionContextSubset -> (map)
                     A list of key-value pairs that must be  included  in  the
                     encryption   context   of   the  cryptographic  operation
                     request. The grant  allows  the  cryptographic  operation
                     only  when the encryption context in the request includes
                     the  key-value  pairs  specified  in   this   constraint,
                     although it can include additional key-value pairs.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 EncryptionContextEquals -> (map)
                     A  list of key-value pairs that must match the encryption
                     context in the cryptographic operation request. The grant
                     allows  the operation only when the encryption context in
                     the request is the same as the encryption context  speci-
                     fied in this constraint.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When  Truncated  is  true,  this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.

       Truncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When
          this  value  is true, the list in this response is truncated. To get
          more items, pass the value of the NextMarker element in thisresponse
          to the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.



                                                                 LIST-GRANTS()
