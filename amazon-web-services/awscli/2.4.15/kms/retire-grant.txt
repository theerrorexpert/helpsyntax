RETIRE-GRANT()                                                  RETIRE-GRANT()



NAME
       retire-grant -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a grant. Typically, you retire a grant when you no longer need
       its permissions. To identify the grant to retire, use a grant  token  ,
       or  both  the  grant ID and a key identifier (key ID or key ARN) of the
       KMS key. The  CreateGrant operation returns both values.

       This operation can be called by the retiring principal for a grant,  by
       the  grantee  principal  if the grant allows the RetireGrant operation,
       and by the Amazon Web Services account (root user) in which  the  grant
       is  created. It can also be called by principals to whom permission for
       retiring a grant is delegated. For details, see Retiring  and  revoking
       grants in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see
       Using grants in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide  *  .  For
       examples  of  working with grants in several programming languages, see
       Programming grants .
          Cross-account use : Yes. You can retire a grant on a KMS  key  in  a
          different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required  permissions:  :Permission  to retire a grant is determined
          primarily by the grant.  For  details,  see  Retiring  and  revoking
          grants in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            retire-grant
          [--grant-token <value>]
          [--key-id <value>]
          [--grant-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --grant-token (string)
          Identifies  the  grant  to  be retired. You can use a grant token to
          identify a new grant even before it has  achieved  eventual  consis-
          tency.

          Only  the  CreateGrant operation returns a grant token. For details,
          see Grant token and Eventual consistency in the Key Management  Ser-
          vice Developer Guide .

       --key-id (string)
          The  key ARN KMS key associated with the grant. To find the key ARN,
          use the  ListKeys operation.

          For                                                         example:
          arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:444455556666:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       --grant-id (string)
          Identifies the grant to retire. To get the grant  ID,  use   Create-
          Grant ,  ListGrants , or  ListRetirableGrants .

          o Grant                 ID                 Example                 -
            0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retire a grant on a customer master key

       The following retire-grant example deletes a grant from a CMK.

       The following example command specifies the  grant-id  and  the  key-id
       parameters.  The  value  of  the  key-id  parameter  must be the Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.

          aws kms retire-grant \
              --grant-id 1234a2345b8a4e350500d432bccf8ecd6506710e1391880c4f7f7140160c9af3 \
              --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This command produces no output. To confirm that the grant was retired,
       use the list-grants command.

       vice Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
