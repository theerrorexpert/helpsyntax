DESCRIBE-KEY()                                                  DESCRIBE-KEY()



NAME
       describe-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  detailed information about a KMS key. You can run DescribeKey
       on a customer managed key or an Amazon Web Services managed key .

       This detailed information includes the  key  ARN,  creation  date  (and
       deletion  date, if applicable), the key state, and the origin and expi-
       ration date (if any) of the key  material.  It  includes  fields,  like
       KeySpec , that help you distinguish symmetric from asymmetric KMS keys.
       It also provides information that is particularly important to asymmet-
       ric keys, such as the key usage (encryption or signing) and the encryp-
       tion algorithms or signing algorithms that the KMS  key  supports.  For
       KMS keys in custom key stores, it includes information about the custom
       key store, such as the key store ID and the CloudHSM  cluster  ID.  For
       multi-Region  keys, it displays the primary key and all related replica
       keys.
          DescribeKey does not return the following information:

       o Aliases associated with the KMS key. To  get  this  information,  use
         ListAliases .

       o Whether automatic key rotation is enabled on the KMS key. To get this
         information, use  GetKeyRotationStatus . Also, some key  states  pre-
         vent a KMS key from being automatically rotated. For details, see How
         Automatic Key Rotation Works  in  Key  Management  Service  Developer
         Guide .

       o Tags on the KMS key. To get this information, use  ListResourceTags .

       o Key policies and grants on the KMS key. To get this information,  use
         GetKeyPolicy and  ListGrants .

       If  you  call the DescribeKey operation on a predefined Amazon Web Ser-
       vices alias , that is, an Amazon Web Services alias with no key ID, KMS
       creates  an  Amazon  Web Services managed key . Then, it associates the
       alias with the new KMS key, and returns the KeyId and Arn  of  the  new
       KMS key in the response.
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in
          a different Amazon Web Services account,  specify  the  key  ARN  or
          alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

          Required permissions : kms:DescribeKey (key policy)

SYNOPSIS
            describe-key
          --key-id <value>
          [--grant-tokens <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Describes the specified KMS key.

          If you specify a predefined Amazon Web Services alias (an Amazon Web
          Services alias with no key ID), KMS associates  the  alias  with  an
          Amazon Web Services managed key and returns its KeyId and Arn in the
          response.

          To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or  alias
          ARN.  When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To specify
          a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you  must  use
          the key ARN or alias ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          To  get  the  key  ID  and  key  ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or
          DescribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use   ListAliases
          .

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use  a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes
          from a new grant that has not yet achieved  eventual  consistency  .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To find detailed information about a customer master key (CMK)

       The following describe-key example gets detailed information about  the
       AWS  managed  CMK  for Amazon S3 in the example account and Region. You
       can use this command to find details about AWS managed  CMKs  and  cus-
       tomer managed CMKs.

       To  specify  the  CMK,  use  the key-id parameter. This example uses an
       alias name value, but you can use a key ID, key  ARN,  alias  name,  or
       alias ARN in this command.

          aws kms describe-key \
              --key-id alias/aws/s3

       Output:

          {

OUTPUT
       KeyMetadata -> (structure)
          Metadata associated with the key.

          AWSAccountId -> (string)
              The twelve-digit account ID of the Amazon Web  Services  account
              that owns the KMS key.

          KeyId -> (string)
              The globally unique identifier for the KMS key.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key. For examples, see
              Key Management Service (KMS) in the Example ARNs section of  the
              Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the KMS key was created.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  KMS  key  is  enabled. When KeyState is
              Enabled this value is true, otherwise it is false.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the KMS key.

          KeyUsage -> (string)
              The cryptographic operations for which you can use the KMS  key.

          KeyState -> (string)
              The current status of the KMS key.

              For  more  information  about how key state affects the use of a
              KMS key, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key in the  Key  Man-
              agement Service Developer Guide .

          DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time  after which KMS deletes this KMS key. This
              value is present only when the KMS key is  scheduled  for  dele-
              tion, that is, when its KeyState is PendingDeletion .

              When  the  primary  key  in  a multi-Region key is scheduled for
              deletion but still has replica keys, its key  state  is  Pendin-
              gReplicaDeletion  and  the  length of its waiting period is dis-
              played in the PendingDeletionWindowInDays field.

          ValidTo -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the imported key material  expires.  When  the
              key  material  expires, KMS deletes the key material and the KMS
              key becomes unusable. This value is present only  for  KMS  keys
              whose  Origin is EXTERNAL and whose ExpirationModel is KEY_MATE-
              RIAL_EXPIRES , otherwise this value is omitted.

          Origin -> (string)
              The source of the key material for the KMS key. When this  value
              is  AWS_KMS  ,  KMS created the key material. When this value is
              EXTERNAL , the key material was imported or the KMS key  doesn't
              have any key material. When this value is AWS_CLOUDHSM , the key
              material was created in the CloudHSM cluster associated  with  a
              custom key store.

          CustomKeyStoreId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier for the custom key store that contains the
              KMS key. This value is present only when the KMS key is  created
              in a custom key store.

          CloudHsmClusterId -> (string)
              The  cluster  ID  of  the CloudHSM cluster that contains the key
              material for the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in a  custom
              key  store , KMS creates the key material for the KMS key in the
              associated CloudHSM cluster. This value is present only when the
              KMS key is created in a custom key store.

          ExpirationModel -> (string)
              Specifies whether the KMS key's key material expires. This value
              is present only when Origin is EXTERNAL , otherwise  this  value
              is omitted.

          KeyManager -> (string)
              The manager of the KMS key. KMS keys in your Amazon Web Services
              account are either customer managed or Amazon Web Services  man-
              aged. For more information about the difference, see KMS keys in
              the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          CustomerMasterKeySpec -> (string)
              Instead, use the KeySpec field.

              The KeySpec  and  CustomerMasterKeySpec  fields  have  the  same
              value. We recommend that you use the KeySpec field in your code.
              However, to  avoid  breaking  changes,  KMS  will  support  both
              fields.

          KeySpec -> (string)
              Describes the type of key material in the KMS key.

          EncryptionAlgorithms -> (list)
              The  encryption algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot
              use the KMS key with other encryption algorithms within KMS.

              This value is present only when the KeyUsage of the KMS  key  is
              ENCRYPT_DECRYPT .

              (string)

          SigningAlgorithms -> (list)
              The signing algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot use
              the KMS key with other signing algorithms within KMS.

              This field appears only when the KeyUsage  of  the  KMS  key  is
              SIGN_VERIFY .

              (string)

          MultiRegion -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  the  KMS  key  is  a multi-Region (True ) or
              regional (False ) key. This value is True for multi-Region  pri-
              mary and replica keys and False for regional KMS keys.

              For   more   information  about  multi-Region  keys,  see  Using
              multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer  Guide
              .

          MultiRegionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Lists  the  primary  and  replica keys in same multi-Region key.
              This field is present only when the  value  of  the  MultiRegion
              field is True .

              For   more  information  about  any  listed  KMS  key,  use  the
              DescribeKey operation.

              o MultiRegionKeyType indicates whether the KMS key is a  PRIMARY
                or REPLICA key.

              o PrimaryKey displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key.
                This field displays the current KMS key if it is  the  primary
                key.

              o ReplicaKeys  displays  the key ARNs and Regions of all replica
                keys. This field includes the current  KMS  key  if  it  is  a
                replica key.

              MultiRegionKeyType -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the KMS key is a PRIMARY or REPLICA key.

              PrimaryKey -> (structure)
                 Displays  the  key  ARN  and  Region of the primary key. This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is the primary  key.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     Displays  the  key  ARN  of a primary or replica key of a
                     multi-Region key.

                 Region -> (string)
                     Displays the Amazon Web Services Region of a  primary  or
                     replica key in a multi-Region key.

              ReplicaKeys -> (list)
                 displays  the  key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is a replica key.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the primary or replica key  in  a  multi-Region
                     key.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        Displays  the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a
                        multi-Region key.

                     Region -> (string)
                        Displays the Amazon Web Services Region of  a  primary
                        or replica key in a multi-Region key.

          PendingDeletionWindowInDays -> (integer)
              The  waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region key
              is deleted. This waiting period begins  when  the  last  of  its
              replica  keys  is  deleted.  This value is present only when the
              KeyState of the KMS key is PendingReplicaDeletion .  That  indi-
              cates that the KMS key is the primary key in a multi-Region key,
              it is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing  replica
              keys.

              When  a  single-Region  KMS key or a multi-Region replica key is
              scheduled for deletion, its deletion date is  displayed  in  the
              DeletionDate   field.   However,  when  the  primary  key  in  a
              multi-Region key is scheduled for deletion, its  waiting  period
              doesn't  begin  until  all of its replica keys are deleted. This
              value displays that waiting period. When the last replica key in
              the  multi-Region  key is deleted, the KeyState of the scheduled
              primary key changes from PendingReplicaDeletion to  PendingDele-
              tion and the deletion date appears in the DeletionDate field.
