LIST-ALIASES()                                                  LIST-ALIASES()



NAME
       list-aliases -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a list of aliases in the caller's Amazon Web Services account and
       region. For more information about aliases, see  CreateAlias .

       By default, the  ListAliases  operation  returns  all  aliases  in  the
       account  and region. To get only the aliases associated with a particu-
       lar KMS key, use the KeyId parameter.

       The ListAliases response can include aliases that you created and asso-
       ciated  with  your  customer  managed keys, and aliases that Amazon Web
       Services created and associated with Amazon Web Services  managed  keys
       in  your account. You can recognize Amazon Web Services aliases because
       their names have the format aws/<service-name> , such as aws/dynamodb .

       The response might also include aliases that have no TargetKeyId field.
       These are predefined aliases that Amazon Web Services has  created  but
       has not yet associated with a KMS key. Aliases that Amazon Web Services
       creates in your account, including predefined  aliases,  do  not  count
       against your KMS aliases quota .
          Cross-account use : No. ListAliases does not return aliases in other
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

          Required permissions : kms:ListAliases (IAM policy)

       Service Developer Guide .

       list-aliases is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Aliases

SYNOPSIS
            list-aliases
          [--key-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Lists only aliases that are associated with the specified  KMS  key.
          Enter a KMS key in your Amazon Web Services account.

          This  parameter is optional. If you omit it, ListAliases returns all
          aliases in the account and Region.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN  for  a  KMS  key,  use   ListKeys  or
          DescribeKey .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list all aliases in an AWS account and Region

       The following example uses the list-aliases command to list all aliases
       in  the  default Region of the AWS account. The output includes aliases
       associated with AWS managed CMKs and customer managed CMKs.

          aws kms list-aliases

       Output:

          {
              "Aliases": [
                  {
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/testKey",
                      "AliasName": "alias/testKey",
                      "TargetKeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
                  },
                  {
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/FinanceDept",
                      "AliasName": "alias/FinanceDept",
                      "TargetKeyId": "0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321"
                  },
                  {
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/aws/dynamodb",
                      "AliasName": "alias/aws/dynamodb",
                      "TargetKeyId": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d"
                  },
                  {
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/aws/ebs",
                      "AliasName": "alias/aws/ebs",
                      "TargetKeyId": "0987ab65-43cd-21ef-09ab-87654321cdef"
                  },
                  ...
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list all aliases for a particular CMK

       The following example uses the  list-aliases  command  and  its  key-id
       parameter  to  list  all  aliases that are associated with a particular
       CMK.

       Each alias is associated with only one CMK, but a CMK can have multiple
       aliases.  This command is very useful because the AWS KMS console lists
       only one alias for each CMK. To find all aliases for a  CMK,  you  must
       use the list-aliases command.

       This example uses the key ID of the CMK for the --key-id parameter, but
       you can use a key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN  in  this  com-
       mand.

          aws kms list-aliases --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       Output:

          {
              "Aliases": [
                  {
                      "TargetKeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/oregon-test-key",
                      "AliasName": "alias/oregon-test-key"
                  },
                  {
                      "TargetKeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/project121-test",
                      "AliasName": "alias/project121-test"
                  }
              ]
          }

       ment Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Aliases -> (list)
          A list of aliases.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an alias.

              AliasName -> (string)
                 String that contains the alias. This value begins with alias/
                 .

              AliasArn -> (string)
                 String that contains the key ARN.

              TargetKeyId -> (string)
                 String  that contains the key identifier of the KMS key asso-
                 ciated with the alias.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time that the alias was most recently created in the
                 account and Region. Formatted as Unix time.

              LastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 Date  and  time  that  the alias was most recently associated
                 with a KMS key in the account and Region. Formatted  as  Unix
                 time.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When  Truncated  is  true,  this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.

       Truncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When
          this  value  is true, the list in this response is truncated. To get
          more items, pass the value of the NextMarker element in thisresponse
          to the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.
