UPDATE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()                            UPDATE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()



NAME
       update-custom-key-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the properties of a custom key store. Use the CustomKeyStoreId
       parameter to identify the custom key store you want to  edit.  Use  the
       remaining  parameters to change the properties of the custom key store.

       You can only update a custom key store that is disconnected. To discon-
       nect the custom key store, use  DisconnectCustomKeyStore . To reconnect
       the custom key store after the update completes, use  ConnectCustomKey-
       Store  .  To  find  the connection state of a custom key store, use the
       DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

       The CustomKeyStoreId parameter is required in  all  commands.  Use  the
       other  parameters  of  UpdateCustomKeyStore to edit your key store set-
       tings.

       o Use the NewCustomKeyStoreName parameter to change the  friendly  name
         of the custom key store to the value that you specify.

       o Use  the  KeyStorePassword parameter tell KMS the current password of
         the       `       kmsuser       crypto       user       (CU)       <-
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-con-
         cepts.html#concept-kmsuser>`__ in the  associated  CloudHSM  cluster.
         You can use this parameter to fix connection failures that occur when
         KMS cannot log into the associated cluster because the kmsuser  pass-
         word  has  changed.  This  value  does not change the password in the
         CloudHSM cluster.

       o Use the CloudHsmClusterId parameter to associate the custom key store
         with  a  different,  but  related, CloudHSM cluster. You can use this
         parameter to repair a  custom  key  store  if  its  CloudHSM  cluster
         becomes  corrupted  or  is  deleted,  or  when  you need to create or
         restore a cluster from a backup.

       If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

       This  operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in KMS,
       which combines the convenience and extensive integration  of  KMS  with
       the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.
          Cross-account  use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:UpdateCustomKeyStore (IAM policy)

SYNOPSIS
            update-custom-key-store
          --custom-key-store-id <value>
          [--new-custom-key-store-name <value>]
          [--key-store-password <value>]
          [--cloud-hsm-cluster-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Identifies the custom key store that you want to update.  Enter  the
          ID  of  the  custom key store. To find the ID of a custom key store,
          use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

       --new-custom-key-store-name (string)
          Changes the friendly name of the custom key store to the value  that
          you  specify. The custom key store name must be unique in the Amazon
          Web Services account.

       --key-store-password (string)
          Enter the current password of the kmsuser crypto user  (CU)  in  the
          CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store.

          This  parameter tells KMS the current password of the kmsuser crypto
          user (CU). It does not set or change the password of  any  users  in
          the CloudHSM cluster.

       --cloud-hsm-cluster-id (string)
          Associates the custom key store with a related CloudHSM cluster.

          Enter the cluster ID of the cluster that you used to create the cus-
          tom key store or a cluster that shares a backup history and has  the
          same  cluster  certificate  as  the original cluster. You cannot use
          this parameter to associate a custom key  store  with  an  unrelated
          cluster.  In  addition,  the  replacement  cluster  must fulfill the
          requirements for a cluster associated with a custom  key  store.  To
          view  the cluster certificate of a cluster, use the DescribeClusters
          operation.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To edit custom key store settings

       The following  update-custom-key-store  example  provides  the  current
       password  for  the  kmsuser  in the CloudHSM cluster that is associated
       with the specified key store. This command doesn't change  the  kmsuser
       password.  It  just  tells AWS KMS the current password. If KMS doesn't
       have the current kmsuser password, it cannot connect to the custom  key
       store.

       NOTE: Before updating the custom key store, you must disconnect it. Use
       the disconnect-custom-key-store command. After the  command  completes,
       you   can   reconnect  the  custom  key  store.  Use  the  connect-cus-
       tom-key-store command.

          aws kms update-custom-key-store \
              --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --key-store-password ExamplePassword

       This command does not return any output. To verify  that  the  password
       change was effective, connect the custom key store.

       Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
