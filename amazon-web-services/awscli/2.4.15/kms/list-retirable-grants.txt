LIST-RETIRABLE-GRANTS()                                LIST-RETIRABLE-GRANTS()



NAME
       list-retirable-grants -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about all grants in the Amazon Web Services account
       and Region that have the specified retiring principal.

       You can specify any principal in your Amazon Web Services account.  The
       grants that are returned include grants for KMS keys in your Amazon Web
       Services account and other Amazon Web Services accounts. You might  use
       this  operation  to  determine which grants you may retire. To retire a
       grant, use the  RetireGrant operation.

       For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see
       Using  grants  in  the * Key Management Service Developer Guide * . For
       examples of working with grants in several programming  languages,  see
       Programming grants .
          Cross-account  use : You must specify a principal in your Amazon Web
          Services account. However, this operation can return grants  in  any
          Amazon Web Services account. You do not need kms:ListRetirableGrants
          permission (or any other additional permission) in  any  Amazon  Web
          Services account other than your own.

          Required  permissions : kms:ListRetirableGrants (IAM policy) in your
          Amazon Web Services account.

SYNOPSIS
            list-retirable-grants
          [--limit <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          --retiring-principal <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --limit (integer)
          Use this parameter to specify the maximum number of items to return.
          When this value is present, KMS does not return more than the speci-
          fied number of items, but it might return fewer.

          This value is optional. If you include a value, it must be between 1
          and  100,  inclusive.  If you do not include a value, it defaults to
          50.

       --marker (string)
          Use this parameter in a  subsequent  request  after  you  receive  a
          response  with  truncated results. Set it to the value of NextMarker
          from the truncated response you just received.

       --retiring-principal (string)
          The retiring principal for which to list grants. Enter  a  principal
          in your Amazon Web Services account.

          To  specify  the  retiring  principal,  use the Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services principal. Valid Amazon Web Services
          principals  include  Amazon Web Services accounts (root), IAM users,
          federated users, and assumed role users. For  examples  of  the  ARN
          syntax  for specifying a principal, see Amazon Web Services Identity
          and Access Management (IAM) in the Example ARNs section of the  Ama-
          zon Web Services General Reference .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view the grants that a principal can retire

       The  following list-retirable-grants example displays all of the grants
       that the ExampleAdmin user can  retire  on  the  customer  master  keys
       (CMKs)  in  an  AWS account and Region. You can use a command like this
       one to view the grants that any account principal can retire on CMKs in
       the AWS account and Region.

       The value of the required retiring-principal parameter must be the Ama-
       zon Resource Name (ARN) of an account, user, or role.

       You cannot specify a service for the  value  of  retiring-principal  in
       this  command,  even though a service can be the retiring principal. To
       find the grants in which a particular service is the  retiring  princi-
       pal, use the list-grants command.

       The output shows that ExampleAdmin user has permission to retire grants
       on two different CMKs in the account and region.  In  addition  to  the
       retiring  principal,  the  account  (root) has permission to retire any
       grant in the account.

              --retiring-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/ExampleAdmin

OUTPUT
       Grants -> (list)
          A list of grants.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a grant.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  for  the  KMS key to which the grant
                 applies.

              GrantId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the grant.

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name that identifies the grant. If  a  name  was
                 provided  in the  CreateGrant request, that name is returned.
                 Otherwise this value is null.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the grant was created.

              GranteePrincipal -> (string)
                 The identity that gets the permissions in the grant.

                 The GranteePrincipal field in the ListGrants response usually
                 contains the user or role designated as the grantee principal
                 in the grant. However, when  the  grantee  principal  in  the
                 grant is an Amazon Web Services service, the GranteePrincipal
                 field contains the service principal , which might  represent
                 several different grantee principals.

              RetiringPrincipal -> (string)
                 The principal that can retire the grant.

              IssuingAccount -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  account under which the grant was
                 issued.

              Operations -> (list)
                 The list of operations permitted by the grant.

                 (string)

              Constraints -> (structure)
                 A list of key-value pairs that must be present in the encryp-
                 tion  context of certain subsequent operations that the grant
                 allows.

                 EncryptionContextSubset -> (map)
                     A list of key-value pairs that must be  included  in  the
                     encryption   context   of   the  cryptographic  operation
                     request. The grant  allows  the  cryptographic  operation
                     only  when the encryption context in the request includes
                     the  key-value  pairs  specified  in   this   constraint,
                     although it can include additional key-value pairs.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 EncryptionContextEquals -> (map)
                     A  list of key-value pairs that must match the encryption
                     context in the cryptographic operation request. The grant
                     allows  the operation only when the encryption context in
                     the request is the same as the encryption context  speci-
                     fied in this constraint.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When  Truncated  is  true,  this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.

       Truncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When
          this  value  is true, the list in this response is truncated. To get
          more items, pass the value of the NextMarker element in thisresponse
          to the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.
