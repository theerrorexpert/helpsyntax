UPDATE-ALIAS()                                                  UPDATE-ALIAS()



NAME
       update-alias -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an  existing KMS alias with a different KMS key. Each alias
       is associated with only one KMS key at a time, although a KMS  key  can
       have  multiple  aliases.  The alias and the KMS key must be in the same
       Amazon Web Services account and Region.

       NOTE:
          Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny  permission
          to  the  KMS key. For details, see Using ABAC in KMS in the Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

       The current and new KMS key must be the same type  (both  symmetric  or
       both   asymmetric),   and   they   must   have   the   same  key  usage
       (ENCRYPT_DECRYPT or SIGN_VERIFY ). This restriction prevents errors  in
       code that uses aliases. If you must assign an alias to a different type
       of KMS key, use  DeleteAlias to delete the old alias  and   CreateAlias
       to create a new alias.

       You  cannot use UpdateAlias to change an alias name. To change an alias
       name, use  DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and  CreateAlias to cre-
       ate a new alias.

       Because  an  alias  is  not  a  property  of a KMS key, you can create,
       update, and delete the aliases of a KMS key without affecting  the  KMS
       key.  Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the  DescribeKey
       operation. To get the aliases of all KMS keys in the account,  use  the
       ListAliases operation.

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key  in  the  Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use  : No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions

       o kms:UpdateAlias on the alias (IAM policy).

       o kms:UpdateAlias on the current KMS key (key policy).

       o kms:UpdateAlias on the new KMS key (key policy).

       For details, see Controlling access to aliases in  the  Key  Management
       Service Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            update-alias
          --alias-name <value>
          --target-key-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alias-name (string)
          Identifies  the  alias that is changing its KMS key. This value must
          begin with alias/ followed by the alias name,  such  as  alias/Exam-
          pleAlias . You cannot use UpdateAlias to change the alias name.

       --target-key-id (string)
          Identifies the customer managed key to associate with the alias. You
          don't have permission to associate an alias with an Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices managed key .

          The  KMS  key  must  be  in the same Amazon Web Services account and
          Region as the alias. Also, the new target KMS key must be  the  same
          type  as the current target KMS key (both symmetric or both asymmet-
          ric) and they must have the same key usage.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN  for  a  KMS  key,  use   ListKeys  or
          DescribeKey .

          To  verify  that  the  alias  is  mapped to the correct KMS key, use
          ListAliases .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate an alias with a different CMK

       The following update-alias example associates the alias  alias/test-key
       with a different CMK.

       o The  --alias-name parameter specifies the alias. The alias name value
         must begin with alias/.

       o The --target-key-id parameter specifies the CMK to associate with the
         alias. You don't need to specify the current CMK for the alias.

            aws kms update-alias \
                --alias-name alias/test-key \
                --target-key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This   command   produces  no  output.  To  find  the  alias,  use  the
       list-aliases command.

       ment Service Developer Guide.
