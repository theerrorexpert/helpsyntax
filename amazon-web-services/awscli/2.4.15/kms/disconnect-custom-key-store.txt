DISCONNECT-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()                    DISCONNECT-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()



NAME
       disconnect-custom-key-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Disconnects  the custom key store from its associated CloudHSM cluster.
       While a custom key store is disconnected, you can manage the custom key
       store  and  its  KMS keys, but you cannot create or use KMS keys in the
       custom key store. You can reconnect the custom key store at any time.

       NOTE:
          While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS
          keys  in  the  custom  key  store  or  to  use  existing KMS keys in
          cryptographic operations will fail. This action  can  prevent  users
          from storing and accessing sensitive data.

       To   find  the  connection  state  of  a  custom  key  store,  use  the
       DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. To reconnect a custom key store, use
       the  ConnectCustomKeyStore operation.

       If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

       This operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in  KMS,
       which  combines  the  convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
       the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a  cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:DisconnectCustomKeyStore (IAM policy)

SYNOPSIS
            disconnect-custom-key-store
          --custom-key-store-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Enter the ID of the custom key store you want to disconnect. To find
          the ID of a custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores oper-
          ation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disconnect a custom key store

       The  following disconnect-custom-key-store example disconnects a custom
       key store from its AWS CloudHSM cluster. You  might  disconnect  a  key
       store  to troubleshoot a problem, to update its settings, or to prevent
       CMKs in the keystore from being used in cryptographic operations.

       Before running this command, replace the example custom  key  store  ID
       with a valid one.

          $ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store \
              --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0

       This  command  produces  no output.  verify that the command was effec-
       tive, use the describe-custom-key-stores command.

       For more information, see Connecting and  Disconnecting  a  Custom  Key
       Store in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
