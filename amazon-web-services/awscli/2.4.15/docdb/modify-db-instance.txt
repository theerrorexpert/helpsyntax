NAME
       modify-db-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  settings for an instance. You can change one or more database
       configuration parameters by specifying these  parameters  and  the  new
       values in the request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-db-instance
          --db-instance-identifier <value>
          [--db-instance-class <value>]
          [--apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately]
          [--preferred-maintenance-window <value>]
          [--auto-minor-version-upgrade | --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade]
          [--new-db-instance-identifier <value>]
          [--ca-certificate-identifier <value>]
          [--promotion-tier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The instance identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance .

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The new compute and memory capacity of the  instance;  for  example,
          db.r5.large . Not all instance classes are available in all Regions.

          If you modify the  instance  class,  an  outage  occurs  during  the
          change.  The  change  is applied during the next maintenance window,
          unless ApplyImmediately is specified as true for this request.

          Default: Uses existing setting.

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          Specifies whether the modifications in this request and any  pending
          modifications  are  asynchronously  applied  as  soon  as  possible,
          regardless  of  the  PreferredMaintenanceWindow  setting   for   the
          instance.

          If  this  parameter  is  set  to false , changes to the instance are
          applied during the next maintenance window. Some  parameter  changes
          can cause an outage and are applied on the next reboot.

          Default: false

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The  weekly  time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can
          occur, which might result in  an  outage.  Changing  this  parameter
          doesn't  result  in an outage except in the following situation, and
          the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.  If  there
          are  pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window
          is changed to include the  current  time,  changing  this  parameter
          causes  a  reboot  of the instance. If you are moving this window to
          the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the cur-
          rent  time  and end of the window to ensure that pending changes are
          applied.

          Default: Uses existing setting.

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

          Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade     |      --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          This  parameter  does  not  apply to Amazon DocumentDB. Amazon Docu-
          mentDB does not perform minor version  upgrades  regardless  of  the
          value set.

       --new-db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  new  instance  identifier  for  the  instance  when renaming an
          instance. When you  change  the  instance  identifier,  an  instance
          reboot  occurs immediately if you set Apply Immediately to true . It
          occurs during the next maintenance window if you set  Apply  Immedi-
          ately to false . This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: mydbinstance

       --ca-certificate-identifier (string)
          Indicates  the  certificate  that  needs  to  be associated with the
          instance.

       --promotion-tier (integer)
          A value that specifies the  order  in  which  an  Amazon  DocumentDB
          replica  is  promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the
          existing primary instance.

          Default: 1

          Valid values: 0-15

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify an Amazon DocumentDB instance

       The following modify-db-instance example modifies the Amazon DocumentDB
       instance   sample-cluster2   by   changing   its   instance   class  to
       db.r4.4xlarge and its promotion tier to  5.  The  changes  are  applied
       immediately  but  can only be seen after the instances status is avail-
       able.
