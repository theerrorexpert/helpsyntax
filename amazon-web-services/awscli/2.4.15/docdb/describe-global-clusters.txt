DESCRIBE-GLOBAL-CLUSTERS()                          DESCRIBE-GLOBAL-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-global-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about Amazon DocumentDB global clusters. This API
       supports pagination.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Amazon DocumentDB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-global-clusters is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: GlobalClusters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-global-clusters
          [--global-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  user-supplied  cluster  identifier. If this parameter is speci-
          fied, information from only the specific cluster is  returned.  This
          parameter isn't case-sensitive.

       --filters (list)
          A  filter that specifies one or more global DB clusters to describe.

          Supported filters: db-cluster-id  accepts  cluster  identifiers  and
          cluster  Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs). The results list will only
          include information about the clusters identified by these ARNs.

          (structure)
              A named set of filter values, used to  return  a  more  specific
              list  of  results.  You  can  use  a  filter  to  match a set of
              resources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

              Wildcards are not supported in filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case  sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 Indicates the database engine version.

              DatabaseName -> (string)

              DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
                 The deletion protection setting for the new global cluster.

              GlobalClusterMembers -> (list)
                 The list of cluster IDs for  secondary  clusters  within  the
                 global cluster. Currently limited to one item.

                 (structure)
                     A  data  structure with information about any primary and
                     secondary clusters associated with an  Amazon  DocumentDB
                     global clusters.

                     DBClusterArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for each Amazon Docu-
                        mentDB cluster.

                     Readers -> (list)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for each read-only sec-
                        ondary cluster associated with the Aurora global clus-
                        ter.

                        (string)

                     IsWriter -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether the Amazon DocumentDB cluster is the
                        primary  cluster  (that is, has read-write capability)
                        for the Amazon DocumentDB global cluster with which it
                        is associated.
