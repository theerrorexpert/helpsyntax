SYNOPSIS
            modify-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          [--sns-topic-arn <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon DocumentDB event notification subscription.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic  created  for  event
          notification.  The  ARN  is  created by Amazon SNS when you create a
          topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of source that is generating the events.  For  example,  if
          you want to be notified of events generated by an instance, set this
          parameter to db-instance . If  this  value  is  not  specified,  all
          events are returned.

          Valid values: db-instance , db-parameter-group , db-security-group

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of  event categories for a SourceType that you want to sub-
          scribe to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
