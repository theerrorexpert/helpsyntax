STOP-DB-CLUSTER()                                            STOP-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       stop-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  the  running  cluster that is specified by DBClusterIdentifier .
       The cluster must be in the available state. For more  information,  see
       Stopping and Starting an Amazon DocumentDB Cluster .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-db-cluster
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The    identifier    of    the    cluster    to    stop.    Example:
          docdb-2019-05-28-15-24-52

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of  Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones   that
              instances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number of days for which automatic snapshots are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier  is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the cluster parameter group for the clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet  group  that  is  associated
              with  the  cluster, including the name, description, and subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint  for  a
              cluster  load  balances connections across the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections  to  the  reader  endpoint,  Amazon  DocumentDB dis-
              tributes the connection requests  among  the  Amazon  DocumentDB
              replicas  in  the  cluster.  This functionality can help balance
              your read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in
              your cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are connected to is promoted to be the  primary  instance,  your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the cluster,  you  can  then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the daily time range during  which  automated  backups
              are  created  if automated backups are enabled, as determined by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

              Specifies the weekly time range during which system  maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  the  Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated  with  a  cluster grant permission for the cluster to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes an Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role  that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                 RoleArn -> (string)

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and  can  be  used  to access other Amazon Web Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with  the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID  - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the clus-
                       ter, but the  cluster  cannot  assume  the  IAMrole  to
                       access  other  Amazon  Web  Services  services  on your
