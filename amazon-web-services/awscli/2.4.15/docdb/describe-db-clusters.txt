NAME
       describe-db-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about provisioned Amazon DocumentDB clusters. This
       API operation supports pagination. For certain management features such
       as  cluster and instance lifecycle management, Amazon DocumentDB lever-
       ages operational technology that is shared with Amazon RDS  and  Amazon
       Neptune.  Use  the  filterName=engine,Values=docdb  filter parameter to
       return only Amazon DocumentDB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-clusters is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DBClusters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-clusters
          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  user-provided  cluster  identifier. If this parameter is speci-
          fied, information from only the specific cluster is  returned.  This
          parameter isn't case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If provided, must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier .

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more clusters to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id  -  Accepts  cluster  identifiers and cluster Amazon
            Resource Names (ARNs). The results list only includes  information
            about the clusters identified by these ARNs.

          (structure)
              A  named  set  of  filter values, used to return a more specific
              list of results. You  can  use  a  filter  to  match  a  set  of
              resources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

              Wildcards are not supported in filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  get  detailed information about one or more Amazon DocumentDB clus-
       ters.

       The following describe-db-clusters example  displays  details  for  the
       Amazon  DocumentDB  cluster  sample-cluster. By omitting the --db-clus-
       ter-identifier parameter you can get information of up to 100 clusters.

          aws docdb describe-db-clusters
              --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster

          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       DBClusters -> (list)
          A list of clusters.

          (structure)
              Detailed information about a cluster.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 Provides the list  of  Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones  that
                 instances in the cluster can be created in.

                 (string)

              BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  number  of days for which automatic snapshots
                 are retained.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains a user-supplied cluster identifier. This  identifier
                 is the unique key that identifies a cluster.

              DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  name  of  the cluster parameter group for the
                 cluster.

              DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies information on the subnet group that is  associated
                 with  the  cluster, including the name, description, and sub-
                 nets in the subnet group.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies the current state of this cluster.

              PercentProgress -> (string)
                 Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

              EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
                 The earliest time to which a database can  be  restored  with
                 point-in-time restore.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 Specifies the connection endpoint for the primary instance of
                 the cluster.

              ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
                 The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint  for
                 a  cluster  load balances connections across the Amazon Docu-
                 mentDB replicas that are available in a cluster.  As  clients
                 request  new connections to the reader endpoint, Amazon Docu-
                 mentDB distributes the connection requests among  the  Amazon
                 DocumentDB  replicas  in  the cluster. This functionality can
                 help balance your read workload across multiple Amazon  Docu-
                 mentDB replicas in your cluster.

                 If  a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that
                 you are connected to is promoted to be the primary  instance,
                 your  connection  is  dropped.  To continue sending your read
                 workload to other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the  cluster,
                 you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.

              MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
                 Specifies the daily time range during which automated backups
                 are created if automated backups are enabled,  as  determined
                 by the BackupRetentionPeriod .

              PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  weekly time range during which system mainte-
                 nance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

              ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster
                 is a secondary cluster.

              ReadReplicaIdentifiers -> (list)
                 Contains  one  or  more identifiers of the secondary clusters
                 that are associated with this cluster.

                 (string)

              DBClusterMembers -> (list)
                 Provides the list of instances that make up the cluster.

                        the cluster.

                     IsClusterWriter -> (boolean)
                        A value that is true if the cluster member is the pri-
                        mary instance for the cluster and false otherwise.

                     DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  status  of the cluster parameter group
                        for this member of the DB cluster.

                     PromotionTier -> (integer)
                        A value that specifies the order in  which  an  Amazon
                        DocumentDB replica is promoted to the primary instance
                        after a failure of the existing primary instance.

              VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
                 Provides a list  of  virtual  private  cloud  (VPC)  security
                 groups that the cluster belongs to.

                 encrypted cluster.

              DbClusterResourceId -> (string)
                 The Region-unique, immutable identifier for the cluster. This
                 identifier  is  found  in CloudTrail log entries whenever the
                 KMS key for the cluster is accessed.

              DBClusterArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cluster.

              AssociatedRoles -> (list)
                 Provides a list of the Identity and Access  Management  (IAM)
                 roles  that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that

                        Describes the state of association between the IAMrole
                        and  the  cluster.  The Status property returns one of
                        the following values:

                        o ACTIVE - The IAMrole  ARN  is  associated  with  the
                          cluster  and  can be used to access other Amazon Web
                          Services services on your behalf.
