NAME
       describe-db-cluster-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  cluster snapshots. This API operation sup-
       ports pagination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-cluster-snapshots is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBClusterSnapshots

SYNOPSIS

          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>]
          [--snapshot-type <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--include-shared | --no-include-shared]
          [--include-public | --no-include-public]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The ID of the cluster to retrieve the list of cluster snapshots for.
          This parameter can't be used  with  the  DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
          parameter. This parameter is not case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If  provided, must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster .

       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A specific cluster snapshot identifier to describe.  This  parameter
          can't  be used with the DBClusterIdentifier parameter. This value is
          stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If provided, must match the identifier of an  existing  DBCluster-
            Snapshot .

          o If  this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of
          the following values:

          o automated  -  Return  all cluster snapshots that Amazon DocumentDB
            has automatically created for your account.

          o manual - Return all cluster snapshots that you have manually  cre-
            ated for your account.

          o shared - Return all manual cluster snapshots that have been shared
            to your account.

          o public - Return all cluster snapshots that  have  been  marked  as
            public.

          If  you  don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both automated and
          manual cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared  clus-
          ter snapshots with these results by setting the IncludeShared param-
          eter to true . You can include public cluster snapshots  with  these
          results by setting the``IncludePublic`` parameter to true .

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A named set of filter values, used to  return  a  more  specific
              list  of  results.  You  can  use  a  filter  to  match a set of
              resources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

              Wildcards are not supported in filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case  sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to include shared manual cluster snapshots from other
          accounts that this account has been  given  permission  to  copy  or
          restore, and otherwise false . The default is false .

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          Set  to true to include manual cluster snapshots that are public and
          can be copied or restored by any account, and otherwise false .  The
          default is false .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
