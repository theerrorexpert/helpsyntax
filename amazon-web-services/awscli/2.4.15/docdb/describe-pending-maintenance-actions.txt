NAME
       describe-pending-maintenance-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of resources (for example, instances) that have at least
       one pending maintenance action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-pending-maintenance-actions is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: PendingMaintenanceActions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-pending-maintenance-actions
          [--resource-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The ARN of a resource to return pending maintenance actions for.

       --filters (list)
          A  filter  that  specifies  one  or more resources to return pending
          maintenance actions for.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts cluster  identifiers  and  cluster  Amazon
            Resource  Names  (ARNs).  The  results  list includes only pending
            maintenance actions for the clusters identified by these ARNs.

          o db-instance-id - Accepts instance identifiers and  instance  ARNs.
            The results list includes only pending maintenance actions for the
            DB instances identified by these ARNs.

          (structure)
              A named set of filter values, used to  return  a  more  specific
              list  of  results.  You  can  use  a  filter  to  match a set of
              resources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

              Wildcards are not supported in filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case  sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following describe-pending-maintenance-actions  example  lists  all
       your pending Amazon DocumentDB maintenance actions.

          aws docdb describe-pending-maintenance-actions

       Output:

          {
              "PendingMaintenanceActions": []
          }

OUTPUT
       PendingMaintenanceActions -> (list)
          The maintenance actions to be applied.

          (structure)
              Represents the output of  ApplyPendingMaintenanceAction .

              ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that has pend-
                 ing maintenance actions.

              PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
                 A  list  that  provides details about the pending maintenance
                 actions for the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Provides information about a pending  maintenance  action
                     for a resource.

                     Action -> (string)
                        The  type of pending maintenance action that is avail-
                        able for the resource.

                     AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date of the maintenance window when the action  is
                        applied.  The  maintenance  action  is  applied to the
                        resource during its  first  maintenance  window  after
                        this date. If this date is specified, any next-mainte-
                        nance opt-in requests are ignored.

                     ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date when the maintenance action is  automatically
                        applied.  The  maintenance  action  is  applied to the
                        resource on this date regardless  of  the  maintenance
                        window  for  the  resource. If this date is specified,
                        any immediate opt-in requests are ignored.

                     OptInStatus -> (string)
                        Indicates the type of opt-in  request  that  has  been
                        received for the resource.

                     CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The effective date when the pending maintenance action
                        is applied to the resource.

                     Description -> (string)
                        A description providing more detail about the  mainte-
                        nance action.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
