       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-source-identifier-to-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          --source-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon DocumentDB  event  notification  subscription
          that you want to add a source identifier to.

       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the event source to be added:

          o If  the source type is an instance, a DBInstanceIdentifier must be
            provided.

          o If the source type is a security group, a DBSecurityGroupName must
            be provided.

          o If  the  source  type is a parameter group, a DBParameterGroupName
            must be provided.

          o If the source type is a snapshot, a DBSnapshotIdentifier  must  be
            provided.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
