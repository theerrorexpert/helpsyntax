DESCRIBE-CERTIFICATES()                                DESCRIBE-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       describe-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of certificate authority (CA) certificates provided by
       Amazon DocumentDB for this account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-certificates is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Certificates

SYNOPSIS
            describe-certificates
          [--certificate-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-identifier (string)
          The user-supplied certificate identifier. If this parameter is spec-
          ified, information for only the specified certificate  is  returned.
          If  this  parameter  is omitted, a list of up to MaxRecords certifi-
          cates is returned. This parameter is not case sensitive.

          Constraints

          o Must match an existing CertificateIdentifier .

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A named set of filter values, used to  return  a  more  specific
              list  of  results.  You  can  use  a  filter  to  match a set of
              resources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

              Wildcards are not supported in filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case  sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Certificates -> (list)
          A list of certificates for this account.

          (structure)

              CertificateIdentifier -> (string)
                 The unique key that identifies a certificate.

                 Example: rds-ca-2019

              CertificateType -> (string)
                 The type of the certificate.

                 Example: CA

              Thumbprint -> (string)
                 The thumbprint of the certificate.

              ValidFrom -> (timestamp)
                 The starting date-time from which the certificate is valid.

                 Example: 2019-07-31T17:57:09Z

              ValidTill -> (timestamp)
                 The date-time after which the certificate is no longer valid.

                 Example: 2024-07-31T17:57:09Z

              CertificateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the certificate.

                 Example: arn:aws:rds:us-east-1::cert:rds-ca-2019

       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional  pagination  token  provided  if  the number of records
          retrieved is greater than MaxRecords . If this parameter  is  speci-
          fied,  the  marker  specifies the next record in the list. Including
          the value of Marker in the next call to DescribeCertificates results
          in the next page of certificates.
