              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          Specifies whether the cluster is encrypted.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key identifier for an encrypted cluster.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption key. If you are creating a cluster using the same account
          that  owns  the  KMS  encryption key that is used to encrypt the new
          cluster, you can use the KMS key alias instead of the  ARN  for  the
          KMS encryption key.

          If an encryption key is not specified in KmsKeyId :

          o If the StorageEncrypted parameter is true , Amazon DocumentDB uses
            your default encryption key.

          KMS creates the  default  encryption  key  for  your  account.  Your
          account has a different default encryption key for each Regions.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          Not currently supported.

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          A  list of log types that need to be enabled for exporting to Amazon
          CloudWatch Logs. You can enable audit logs  or  profiler  logs.  For
          more   information,   see  Auditing  Amazon  DocumentDB  Events  and
          Profiling Amazon DocumentDB Operations .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted. If DeletionProtection
          is  enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is modified and
          DeletionProtection is disabled. DeletionProtection protects clusters
          from being accidentally deleted.

       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the new global cluster.

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the source for the db cluster.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of  Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones   that
              instances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number of days for which automatic snapshots are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier  is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the cluster parameter group for the clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet  group  that  is  associated
              with  the  cluster, including the name, description, and subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint  for  a
              cluster  load  balances connections across the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections  to  the  reader  endpoint,  Amazon  DocumentDB dis-
              tributes the connection requests  among  the  Amazon  DocumentDB
              replicas  in  the  cluster.  This functionality can help balance
              your read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in
              your cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are connected to is promoted to be the  primary  instance,  your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the cluster,  you  can  then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

              Specifies the weekly time range during which system  maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Describes the state of association  between  the  IAMrole
                     and  the  cluster. The Status property returns one of the
                     following values:

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and  can  be  used  to access other Amazon Web Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with  the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID  - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the clus-
                       ter, but the  cluster  cannot  assume  the  IAMrole  to
                       access  other  Amazon  Web  Services  services  on your
                       behalf.

          ClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the time when the cluster was  created,  in  Universal
              Coordinated Time (UTC).

          EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports -> (list)
              A list of log types that this cluster is configured to export to
              Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              (string)

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted.  If  DeletionPro-
              tection  is  enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is
              modified and DeletionProtection is disabled.  DeletionProtection
              protects clusters from being accidentally deleted.
