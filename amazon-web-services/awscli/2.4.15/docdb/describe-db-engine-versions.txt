DESCRIBE-DB-ENGINE-VERSIONS()                    DESCRIBE-DB-ENGINE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       describe-db-engine-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the available engines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-engine-versions  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBEngineVersions

          [--engine <value>]
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--db-parameter-group-family <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--default-only | --no-default-only]
          [--list-supported-character-sets | --no-list-supported-character-sets]

OPTIONS
       --engine (string)
          The database engine to return.

       --engine-version (string)
          The database engine version to return.

          Example: 3.6.0

       --db-parameter-group-family (string)
          The name of a specific parameter group family to return details for.

          Constraints:

          o If provided, must match an existing DBParameterGroupFamily .

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  named  set  of  filter values, used to return a more specific
              list of results. You  can  use  a  filter  to  match  a  set  of
              resources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

              Wildcards are not supported in filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --default-only | --no-default-only (boolean)
          Indicates that only the default version of the specified  engine  or
          engine and major version combination is returned.

       --list-supported-character-sets   |  --no-list-supported-character-sets
       (boolean)
          If this parameter is specified and the requested engine supports the
          CharacterSetName  parameter  for  CreateDBInstance  ,  the  response
          includes a list of supported character sets for each engine version.

       --list-supported-timezones | --no-list-supported-timezones (boolean)
          If this parameter is specified and the requested engine supports the
          TimeZone parameter for CreateDBInstance , the  response  includes  a
          list of supported time zones for each engine version.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
