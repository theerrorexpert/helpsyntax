RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()          RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new cluster from a snapshot or cluster snapshot.

       If  a  snapshot  is  specified,  the target cluster is created from the
       source DB snapshot with a default configuration  and  default  security
       group.

       If  a cluster snapshot is specified, the target cluster is created from
       the source cluster restore point with the  same  configuration  as  the
       original source DB cluster, except that the new cluster is created with
       the default security group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          the restored DB cluster can be created in.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The name of the cluster to create from the snapshot or cluster snap-

       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the snapshot or cluster snapshot to restore from.

          You  can  use  either  the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to
          specify a cluster snapshot. However, you can use  only  the  ARN  to
          specify a snapshot.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing snapshot.

       --engine (string)
          The database engine to use for the new cluster.

          Default: The same as source.

          Constraint: Must be compatible with the engine of the source.

       --engine-version (string)
          The version of the database engine to use for the new cluster.

       --port (integer)
          The port number on which the new cluster accepts connections.

          Constraints: Must be a value from 1150 to 65535 .

          Default: The same port as the original cluster.

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the subnet group to use for the new cluster.

          Constraints:  If provided, must match the name of an existing DBSub-
          netGroup .

          Example: mySubnetgroup

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) security groups that  the  new
          cluster will belong to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the restored cluster.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon DocumentDB resource consisting of
              a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The required name of the tag. The string value can be from  1
                 to  128  Unicode  characters  in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the  set
                 of  Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/', '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to  256  Unicode  characters  in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the  set
                 of  Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/', '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key identifier to use when restoring  an  encrypted  cluster
          from a DB snapshot or cluster snapshot.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption key. If you are restoring a cluster with the same account
          that  owns  the  KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new cluster,
          then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN  for  the  KMS
          encryption key.

          If  you  do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then the
          following occurs:

          o If the snapshot  or  cluster  snapshot  in  SnapshotIdentifier  is
            encrypted,  then  the  restored cluster is encrypted using the KMS
            key that was used to encrypt the snapshot or the cluster snapshot.

          o If  the  snapshot or the cluster snapshot in SnapshotIdentifier is
            not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is not encrypted.

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          A list of log types that must be enabled  for  exporting  to  Amazon
          CloudWatch Logs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted. If DeletionProtection
          is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is modified  and
          DeletionProtection is disabled. DeletionProtection protects clusters
          from being accidentally deleted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides   the  list  of  Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones  that
              instances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which automatic  snapshots  are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the cluster parameter group for the  clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  information  on  the  subnet group that is associated
              with the cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader  endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint for a
              cluster load balances connections across the  Amazon  DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections to  the  reader  endpoint,  Amazon  DocumentDB  dis-
              tributes  the  connection  requests  among the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas in the cluster. This  functionality  can  help  balance
              your read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in
              your cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are  connected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other  Amazon  DocumentDB  replicas in the cluster, you can then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              with point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

          MasterUsername -> (string)
              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the  daily  time range during which automated backups
              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

              Contains  one or more identifiers of the secondary clusters that
              are associated with this cluster.

              (string)

          DBClusterMembers -> (list)
              Provides the list of instances that make up the cluster.

              (structure)

                     Specifies  the instance identifier for this member of the
                     cluster.

                 IsClusterWriter -> (boolean)
                     A value that is true if the cluster member is the primary
                     instance for the cluster and false otherwise.

                     a failure of the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides a list of virtual private cloud (VPC)  security  groups
              that the cluster belongs to.

              (structure)
                 Used  as  a  response  element for queries on virtual private

              Provides a list of the  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated with a cluster grant permission for  the  cluster  to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes  an  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                 RoleArn -> (string)

                     following values:

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and can be used to access  other  Amazon  Web  Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING  - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the  clus-
                       ter,  but  the  cluster  cannot  assume  the IAMrole to
                       access other  Amazon  Web  Services  services  on  your
