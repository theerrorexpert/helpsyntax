OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  cluster identifier for the cluster that is being modified. This
          parameter is not case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster .

       --new-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The new cluster identifier for the cluster when renaming a  cluster.
          This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster2

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          A  value  that specifies whether the changes in this request and any
          pending changes are asynchronously  applied  as  soon  as  possible,
          regardless  of  the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the clus-
          ter. If this parameter is set to false , changes to the cluster  are
          applied during the next maintenance window.

          The  ApplyImmediately parameter affects only the NewDBClusterIdenti-
          fier and MasterUserPassword values. If you set this parameter  value
          to false , the changes to the NewDBClusterIdentifier and MasterUser-
          Password values are applied during the next maintenance window.  All
          other  changes  are  applied immediately, regardless of the value of
          the ApplyImmediately parameter.

          Default: false

       --backup-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days for which automated  backups  are  retained.  You
          must specify a minimum value of 1.

          Default: 1

          Constraints:

          o Must be a value from 1 to 35.

       --db-cluster-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the cluster parameter group to use for the cluster.

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) security groups that the clus-
          ter will belong to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --port (integer)
          The port number on which the cluster accepts connections.

          Default: The same port as the original cluster.

       --master-user-password (string)
          The password for the master database user. This password can contain
          any printable ASCII character except forward slash (/), double quote
          ("), or the "at" symbol (@).

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 100 characters.

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The daily time range during which automated backups are  created  if
          automated  backups  are  enabled,  using  the  BackupRetentionPeriod
          parameter.

          The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an  8-hour
          block of time for each Region.

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi .

          o Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The  weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in
          Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an  8-hour
          block  of  time  for  each  Region, occurring on a random day of the
          week.

          Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

          Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.

       --cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration (structure)
          The configuration setting for the log types to be enabled for export
          to  Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs for a specific instance or cluster. The
          EnableLogTypes and DisableLogTypes arrays determine which  logs  are
          exported (or not exported) to CloudWatch Logs.

          EnableLogTypes -> (list)
              The list of log types to enable.

              (string)

          DisableLogTypes -> (list)
              The list of log types to disable.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EnableLogTypes=string,string,DisableLogTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EnableLogTypes": ["string", ...],

          }

       --engine-version (string)
          The  version  number  of  the  database  engine to which you want to
          upgrade. Modifying engine version is not supported on  Amazon  Docu-
          mentDB.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted. If DeletionProtection
          is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is modified  and
          DeletionProtection is disabled. DeletionProtection protects clusters
          from being accidentally deleted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify an Amazon DocumentDB cluster

       The following modify-db-cluster example modifies the Amazon  DocumentDB
       cluster  sample-cluster  by  making  the retention period for automatic
       backups 7 days, and changing the preferred windows for both backups and
       maintenance. All changes are applied at the next maintenance window.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of  Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones   that
              instances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number of days for which automatic snapshots are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier  is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the cluster parameter group for the clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet  group  that  is  associated
              with  the  cluster, including the name, description, and subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint  for  a
              cluster  load  balances connections across the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections  to  the  reader  endpoint,  Amazon  DocumentDB dis-
              tributes the connection requests  among  the  Amazon  DocumentDB
              replicas  in  the  cluster.  This functionality can help balance
              your read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in
              your cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are connected to is promoted to be the  primary  instance,  your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the cluster,  you  can  then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the cluster has instances in multiple Avail-
              ability Zones.

              Specifies  the  latest  time to which a database can be restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the daily time range during  which  automated  backups
              are  created  if automated backups are enabled, as determined by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the weekly time range during which system  maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

          ReadReplicaIdentifiers -> (list)
              Contains one or more identifiers of the secondary clusters  that
              are associated with this cluster.

              (string)

          DBClusterMembers -> (list)
              Provides the list of instances that make up the cluster.

              (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  an  instance  that is part of a
                 cluster.

                 DBInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                     Specifies the instance identifier for this member of  the
                     cluster.

                 IsClusterWriter -> (boolean)
                     A value that is true if the cluster member is the primary
                     instance for the cluster and false otherwise.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies the status of the cluster parameter  group  for
                     this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A value that specifies the order in which an Amazon Docu-
                     mentDB replica is promoted to the primary instance  after
                     a failure of the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides  a  list of virtual private cloud (VPC) security groups
              that the cluster belongs to.

              (structure)
                 Used as a response element for  queries  on  virtual  private
                 cloud (VPC) security group membership.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  the  Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated  with  a  cluster grant permission for the cluster to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes an Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role  that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
