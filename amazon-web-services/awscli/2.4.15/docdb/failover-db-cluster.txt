FAILOVER-DB-CLUSTER()                                    FAILOVER-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       failover-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Forces a failover for a cluster.

       A failover for a cluster promotes one of the Amazon DocumentDB replicas
       (read-only instances) in the cluster to be the  primary  instance  (the
       cluster writer).

       If  the  primary  instance fails, Amazon DocumentDB automatically fails
       over to an Amazon DocumentDB replica, if one exists. You  can  force  a
       failover  when you want to simulate a failure of a primary instance for
       testing.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            failover-db-cluster
          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--target-db-instance-identifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          A cluster identifier to force a failover for. This parameter is  not
          case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster .

       --target-db-instance-identifier (string)
          The name of the instance to promote to the primary instance.

          You  must  specify  the instance identifier for an Amazon DocumentDB
          replica in the cluster. For example, mydbcluster-replica1 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To force an Amazon DocumentDB cluster to failover to a replica

       The following failover-db-cluster example causes the  primary  instance
       in  the  Amazon  DocumentDB  cluster  sample-cluster  to  failover to a
       replica.

          aws docdb failover-db-cluster \
              --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides   the  list  of  Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones  that
              instances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which automatic  snapshots  are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the cluster parameter group for the  clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  information  on  the  subnet group that is associated
              with the cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader  endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint for a
              cluster load balances connections across the  Amazon  DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections to  the  reader  endpoint,  Amazon  DocumentDB  dis-
              tributes  the  connection  requests  among the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas in the cluster. This  functionality  can  help  balance
              your read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in
              your cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are  connected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other  Amazon  DocumentDB  replicas in the cluster, you can then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the cluster has instances in  multiple  Avail-
              ability Zones.

              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the  daily  time range during which automated backups
              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

          ReadReplicaIdentifiers -> (list)
              Contains  one or more identifiers of the secondary clusters that
              are associated with this cluster.

                     Specifies  the instance identifier for this member of the
                     cluster.

                 IsClusterWriter -> (boolean)
                     A value that is true if the cluster member is the primary
                     instance for the cluster and false otherwise.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  status of the cluster parameter group for
                     this member of the DB cluster.

              key for the cluster is accessed.

          DBClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides a list of the  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated with a cluster grant permission for  the  cluster  to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes  an  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                     following values:

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and can be used to access  other  Amazon  Web  Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING  - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the  clus-
                       ter,  but  the  cluster  cannot  assume  the IAMrole to
                       access other  Amazon  Web  Services  services  on  your
                       behalf.
