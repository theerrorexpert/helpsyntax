DELETE-DB-CLUSTER()                                        DELETE-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  previously  provisioned cluster. When you delete a cluster,
       all automated backups for that cluster are deleted and can't be  recov-
       ered.  Manual  DB  cluster  snapshots  of the specified cluster are not
       deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-cluster
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot]
          [--final-db-snapshot-identifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier for the cluster to be deleted. This parameter
          isn't case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier .

       --skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot (boolean)
          Determines  whether  a  final cluster snapshot is created before the
          cluster is deleted. If true is specified,  no  cluster  snapshot  is
          created. If false is specified, a cluster snapshot is created before
          the DB cluster is deleted.

          NOTE:
              If SkipFinalSnapshot is false , you must specify a  FinalDBSnap-
              shotIdentifier parameter.

          Default: false

       --final-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  cluster snapshot identifier of the new cluster snapshot created
          when SkipFinalSnapshot is set to false .

          NOTE:
              Specifying this parameter and also setting the SkipFinalShapshot
              parameter to true results in an error.

          Constraints:

          o Must be from 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an Amazon DocumentDB cluster

       The  following  delete-db-cluster example deletes the Amazon DocumentDB
       cluster sample-cluster. No backup of  the  cluster  is  made  prior  to
       deleting  it.  NOTE:  You must delete all instances associated with the
       cluster before you can delete it.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides   the  list  of  Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones  that
              instances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which automatic  snapshots  are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the cluster parameter group for the  clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  information  on  the  subnet group that is associated
              with the cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader  endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint for a
              cluster load balances connections across the  Amazon  DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections to  the  reader  endpoint,  Amazon  DocumentDB  dis-
              tributes  the  connection  requests  among the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas in the cluster. This  functionality  can  help  balance
              your read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in
              your cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are  connected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other  Amazon  DocumentDB  replicas in the cluster, you can then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the cluster has instances in  multiple  Avail-
              ability Zones.

              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the  daily  time range during which automated backups
              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

          ReadReplicaIdentifiers -> (list)
              Contains  one or more identifiers of the secondary clusters that
              are associated with this cluster.

              (string)

          DBClusterMembers -> (list)
              Provides the list of instances that make up the cluster.

              (structure)

                 cluster.

                 DBInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                     Specifies  the instance identifier for this member of the
                     cluster.

                 IsClusterWriter -> (boolean)
                     A value that is true if the cluster member is the primary
                     instance for the cluster and false otherwise.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  status of the cluster parameter group for

              key for the cluster is accessed.

          DBClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides a list of the  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated with a cluster grant permission for  the  cluster  to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes  an  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                 RoleArn -> (string)

                     following values:

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and can be used to access  other  Amazon  Web  Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING  - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the  clus-
                       ter,  but  the  cluster  cannot  assume  the IAMrole to
                       access other  Amazon  Web  Services  services  on  your
                       behalf.

              Specifies  whether  this cluster can be deleted. If DeletionPro-
              tection is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless  it  is
              modified  and DeletionProtection is disabled. DeletionProtection
              protects clusters from being accidentally deleted.
