GET-RETAINED-MESSAGE()                                  GET-RETAINED-MESSAGE()



NAME
       get-retained-message -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the details of a single retained message for the specified topic.

       This action returns the message payload of the retained message,  which
       can incur messaging costs. To list only the topic names of the retained
       messages, call ListRetainedMessages .

       Requires permission to access the GetRetainedMessage action.

       For more information about messaging costs, see IoT Core pricing - Mes-
       saging .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       NOTE:
          The default endpoint data.iot.[region].amazonaws.com is intended for
          testing purposes only. For production code  it  is  strongly  recom-
          mended to use the custom endpoint for your account  (retrievable via
          the iot describe-endpoint command) to ensure best  availability  and
          reachability of the service.

SYNOPSIS
            get-retained-message
          --topic <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --topic (string)
          The topic name of the retained message to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       topic -> (string)
          The topic name to which the retained message was published.

       payload -> (blob)
          The Base64-encoded message payload of the retained message body.

       qos -> (integer)
          The quality of service (QoS) level used to publish the retained mes-
          sage.

       lastModifiedTime -> (long)
          The Epoch date and time, in milliseconds, when the retained  message
          was stored by IoT.
