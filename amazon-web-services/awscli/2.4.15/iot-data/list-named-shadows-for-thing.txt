       NOTE:
          The default endpoint data.iot.[region].amazonaws.com is intended for
          testing purposes only. For production code  it  is  strongly  recom-
          mended to use the custom endpoint for your account  (retrievable via
          the iot describe-endpoint command) to ensure best  availability  and
          reachability of the service.

SYNOPSIS
            list-named-shadows-for-thing
          --thing-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to retrieve the next set of results.

       --page-size (integer)
          The result page size.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       results -> (list)
          The list of shadows for the specified thing.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to  use to get the next set of results, or null if there
          are no additional results.

       timestamp -> (long)
          The Epoch date and time the response was generated by IoT.
