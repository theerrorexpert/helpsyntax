       NOTE:
          The default endpoint data.iot.[region].amazonaws.com is intended for
          testing  purposes  only.  For  production code it is strongly recom-
          mended to use the custom endpoint for your account  (retrievable via
          the  iot  describe-endpoint command) to ensure best availability and
          reachability of the service.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a device's shadow document

       The following delete-thing-shadow example  deletes  the  entire  shadow
       document for the device named MyRPi.

          aws iot-data delete-thing-shadow \
              --thing-name MyRPi \
              "output.txt"

       The  command produces no output on the display, but output.txt contains
       information that confirms the version and timestamp of the shadow docu-
       ment that you deleted.

          {"version":2,"timestamp":1560270384}

       Guide.
