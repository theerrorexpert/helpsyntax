BATCH-GET-CHANNEL()                                        BATCH-GET-CHANNEL()



NAME
       batch-get-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Performs  GetChannel on multiple ARNs simultaneously.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-channel
          --arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arns (list)
          Array of ARNs, one per channel.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get channel configuration information about multiple channels

       The  following  batch-get-channel  example  lists information about the
       specified channels.

          aws ivs batch-get-channel \
              --arns arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh \
                  arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/efghEFGHijkl

OUTPUT
       channels -> (list)
          (structure)
              Object specifying a channel.

              arn -> (string)
                 Channel ARN.

              authorized -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  channel is private (enabled for playback autho-
                 rization). Default: false .

              ingestEndpoint -> (string)
                 Channel ingest endpoint, part of the definition of an  ingest
                 server, used when you set up streaming software.

              latencyMode -> (string)
                 Channel  latency  mode.  Use  NORMAL to broadcast and deliver
                 live video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interac-
                 tion  with  viewers.  Default: LOW . (Note: In the Amazon IVS
                 console, LOW and NORMAL correspond to Ultra-low and Standard,
                 respectively.)

              name -> (string)
                 Channel name.

              playbackUrl -> (string)
                 Channel playback URL.

              recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration  ARN.  A  value  other  than an empty
                 string indicates  that  recording  is  enabled.  Default:  ""
                 (empty string, recording is disabled).

              tags -> (map)
                 Array   of   1-50   maps,  each  of  the  form  string:string
                 (key:value) .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 Channel type, which determines the allowable  resolution  and
                 bitrate.  If  you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate,
                 the stream probably  will  disconnect  immediately.  Default:
                 STANDARD . Valid values:

                 o STANDARD : Multiple qualities are generated from the origi-
                   nal input, to automatically give viewers the  best  experi-
                   ence  for  their devices and network conditions. Resolution
                   can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio
                   is  transcoded  only  for  renditions 360p and below; above
                   that, audio is passed through.

                 o BASIC : Amazon IVS delivers the original input to  viewers.
                   The viewers video-quality choice is limited to the original
                   input. Resolution can be up to 480p and bitrate can  be  up
                   to 1.5 Mbps.

       errors -> (list)
          Each error object is related to a specific ARN in the request.

          (structure)
              Error related to a specific channel, specified by its ARN.

              arn -> (string)
                 Channel ARN.

              code -> (string)
                 Error code.

              message -> (string)
                 Error message, determined by the application.
