DESCRIPTION
          Introduction

       The  Amazon  Interactive  Video  Service  (IVS) API is REST compatible,
       using a standard HTTP API and an Amazon Web Services EventBridge  event
       stream  for  responses.  JSON  is used for both requests and responses,
       including errors.

       The API is an Amazon Web Services regional service. For a list of  sup-
       ported  regions  and Amazon IVS HTTPS service endpoints, see the Amazon
       IVS page in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          o All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. *

       For a summary of notable documentation changes  in  each  release,  see
       Document History .

          Resources

       The  following resources contain information about your IVS live stream
       (see Getting Started with Amazon IVS ):

       o Channel  Stores configuration data related to your live  stream.  You
         first  create a channel and then use the channels stream key to start
         your live stream. See the Channel endpoints for more information.

       o Stream key  An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when  you  create  a
         channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey
         endpoints for more information. * Treat the stream key like a secret,
         since it allows anyone to stream to the channel. *

       o Playback  key  pair   Video  playback  may  be restricted using play-
         back-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption.  A  play-
         back  key  pair  is  the public-private pair of keys used to sign and
         validate the playback-authorization token.  See  the  PlaybackKeyPair
         endpoints for more information.

       o Recording  configuration  Stores configuration related to recording a
         live stream and where to store the recorded content.  Multiple  chan-
         nels  can reference the same recording configuration. See the Record-
         ing Configuration endpoints for more information.
          Tagging

       A tag is a metadata label that you assign to  an  Amazon  Web  Services
       resource.  A  tag  comprises  a  key and a value , both set by you. For
       example, you might set a tag as  topic:nature  to  label  a  particular
       video  category.  See  Tagging  Amazon  Web Services Resources for more
       information, including restrictions that apply to tags.

       Tags can help you  identify  and  organize  your  Amazon  Web  Services
       resources.  For  example,  you  can  use  the  same  tag  for different
       resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use  tags  to
       manage access (see Access Tags ).

       The  Amazon  IVS  API  has  these tag-related endpoints:  TagResource ,
       UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource . The following resources sup-
       port  tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording
       Configurations.

       At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.
          Authentication versus Authorization

       Note the differences between these concepts:

       o Authentication is about verifying identity. You need to be  authenti-
         cated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.

       o Authorization  is  about  granting permissions. You need to be autho-
         rized to view Amazon IVS private channels  .  (Private  channels  are
         channels that are enabled for "playback authorization.")
          Authentication

       All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a signature. The
       Amazon Web Services Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon IVS  Player
       SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if
       your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, its your  responsi-
       bility to sign the requests.

       You  generate  a  signature using valid Amazon Web Services credentials
       that have permission to perform the requested action. For example,  you
       must  sign  PutMetadata requests with a signature generated from an IAM
       user account that has the ivs:PutMetadata permission.

       For more information:

       o Authentication and generating signatures  See Authenticating Requests
         (Amazon  Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon Web Services
         General Reference .

       o Managing Amazon IVS permissions  See Identity and  Access  Management
         on the Security page of the Amazon IVS User Guide .
          Channel Endpoints

       o CreateChannel   Creates a new channel and an associated stream key to
         start streaming.

       o GetChannel  Gets the channel configuration for the specified  channel
         ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

       o BatchGetChannel   Performs   GetChannel  on  multiple ARNs simultane-
         ously.

       o ListChannels  Gets summary information about  all  channels  in  your
         account,  in  the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is
         processed. This list can be filtered to match  a  specified  name  or
         recording-configuration  ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and can-
         not be used together. If you try to use both filters, you will get an
         error (409 Conflict Exception).

       o UpdateChannel   Updates  a  channel's  configuration.  This  does not
         affect an ongoing stream of this channel. You must stop  and  restart
         the stream for the changes to take effect.

       o DeleteChannel  Deletes the specified channel.
          StreamKey Endpoints

       o CreateStreamKey  Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for
         the specified channel ARN.

       o GetStreamKey  Gets stream key information for the specified ARN.

       o BatchGetStreamKey  Performs  GetStreamKey on multiple ARNs simultane-
         ously.

       o ListStreamKeys   Gets  summary  information about stream keys for the
         specified channel.

       o DeleteStreamKey  Deletes the stream key for the specified ARN, so  it
         can no longer be used to stream.
          Stream Endpoints

       o GetStream  Gets information about the active (live) stream on a spec-
         ified channel.

       o GetStreamSession  Gets metadata on a specified stream.

       o ListStreams  Gets summary information  about  live  streams  in  your
         account,  in  the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is
         processed.

       o ListStreamSessions  Gets a summary of current  and  previous  streams
         for  a specified channel in your account, in the AWS region where the
         API request is processed.

       o StopStream  Disconnects the incoming RTMPS stream for  the  specified
         channel.  Can be used in conjunction with  DeleteStreamKey to prevent
         further streaming to a channel.

       o PutMetadata  Inserts metadata into the active stream of the specified
         channel.  At most 5 requests per second per channel are allowed, each
         with a maximum 1 KB payload. (If 5 TPS is  not  sufficient  for  your
         needs,  we  recommend  batching  your  data into a single PutMetadata
         call.) At most 155 requests per second per account are allowed.
          PlaybackKeyPair Endpoints

       For more information, see Setting Up Private Channels in the Amazon IVS
       User Guide .

       o ImportPlaybackKeyPair   Imports  the public portion of a new key pair
         and returns its arn and fingerprint . The privateKey can then be used
         to  generate  viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to
         private channels (channels enabled for playback authorization).

       o GetPlaybackKeyPair  Gets a specified playback authorization key  pair
         and  returns  the  arn  and  fingerprint . The privateKey held by the
         caller can be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to  grant
         viewers access to private channels.

       o ListPlaybackKeyPairs   Gets  summary  information  about playback key
         pairs.

       o DeletePlaybackKeyPair  Deletes a specified  authorization  key  pair.
         This  invalidates  future viewer tokens generated using the key pairs
         privateKey .
          RecordingConfiguration Endpoints

       o CreateRecordingConfiguration  Creates a new recording  configuration,
         used to enable recording to Amazon S3.

       o GetRecordingConfiguration   Gets the recording-configuration metadata
         for the specified ARN.

       o ListRecordingConfigurations   Gets  summary  information  about   all
         recording  configurations in your account, in the Amazon Web Services
         region where the API request is processed.

       o DeleteRecordingConfiguration  Deletes the recording configuration for
         the specified ARN.
          Amazon Web Services Tags Endpoints

       o TagResource   Adds  or  updates  tags  for  the  Amazon  Web Services
         resource with the specified ARN.

       o UntagResource  Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.

       o ListTagsForResource   Gets information about Amazon Web Services tags
         for the specified ARN.
