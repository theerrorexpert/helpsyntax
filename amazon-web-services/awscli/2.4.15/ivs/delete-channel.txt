DELETE-CHANNEL()                                              DELETE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       delete-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified channel and its associated stream keys.

       If  you  try  to delete a live channel, you will get an error (409 Con-
       flictException). To delete a channel that is live, call   StopStream  ,
       wait  for the Amazon EventBridge "Stream End" event (to verify that the
       stream's state was changed from Live to Offline), then call DeleteChan-
       nel. (See Using EventBridge with Amazon IVS .)

SYNOPSIS
            delete-channel
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the channel to be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
