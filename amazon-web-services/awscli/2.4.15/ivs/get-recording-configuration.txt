GET-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()                    GET-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-recording-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the recording configuration for the specified ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-recording-configuration
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the recording configuration to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a RecordingConfiguration resource

       The  following  get-recording-configuration  example  gets  information
       about the RecordingConfiguration resource for the specified ARN.

          aws ivs get-recording-configuration \
              --arn "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ"

       Output:

          {
              "recordingConfiguration": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ",
                  "name": "test-recording-config",
                  "destinationConfiguration": {
                      "s3": {
                          "bucketName": "demo-recording-bucket"
                      }
                  },
                  "state": "ACTIVE",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       recordingConfiguration -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Recording-configuration ARN.

          destinationConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that contains information about where recorded
              video will be stored.

              s3 -> (structure)
                 An S3 destination configuration where recorded videos will be
                 stored.

                 bucketName -> (string)
                     Location  (S3  bucket name) where recorded videos will be
                     stored.

          name -> (string)
              Recording-configuration name. The value  does  not  need  to  be
              unique.

          state -> (string)
              Indicates the current state of the recording configuration. When
              the state is ACTIVE , the configuration is ready for recording a
              channel stream.

          tags -> (map)
              Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          thumbnailConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that allows you to enable/disable  the  recording
              of  thumbnails  for  a  live  session and modify the interval at
              which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

              recordingMode -> (string)
                 Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

              targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
                 The targeted thumbnail-generation interval in  seconds.  This
                 is  configurable  (and  required)  only  if  recordingMode is
                 INTERVAL . Default: 60.
                     Important: Setting a value for targetIntervalSeconds does
                     not guarantee that thumbnails are generated at the speci-
                     fied interval. For thumbnails to be generated at the tar-
                     getIntervalSeconds  interval,  the IDR/Keyframe value for
                     the input video must be less than the  targetIntervalSec-
                     onds  value.  See  Amazon IVS Streaming Configuration for
                     information on setting IDR/Keyframe  to  the  recommended
                     value in video-encoder settings.
