CREATE-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()              CREATE-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       create-recording-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Ama-
       zon S3.
          Known issue: In the us-east-1 region, if you use the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices  CLI  to  create a recording configuration, it returns success
          even if the S3 bucket is in a different region. In  this  case,  the
          state  of  the  recording configuration is CREATE_FAILED (instead of
          ACTIVE ). (In other regions, the CLI correctly  returns  failure  if
          the bucket is in a different region.)

          Workaround:  Ensure that your S3 bucket is in the same region as the
          recording configuration. If you create a recording configuration  in
          a different region as your S3 bucket, delete that recording configu-
          ration and create a new one with  an  S3  bucket  from  the  correct
          region.

SYNOPSIS
            create-recording-configuration
          --destination-configuration <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--thumbnail-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --destination-configuration (structure)
          A  complex  type that contains a destination configuration for where
          recorded video will be stored.

          s3 -> (structure)
              An S3 destination configuration where recorded  videos  will  be
              stored.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 Location  (S3  bucket  name)  where  recorded  videos will be
                 stored.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3={bucketName=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3": {
              "bucketName": "string"
            }
          }

       --name (string)
          Recording-configuration name. The value does not need to be  unique.

       --tags (map)
          Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --thumbnail-configuration (structure)
          A  complex  type  that allows you to enable/disable the recording of
          thumbnails for a live session  and  modify  the  interval  at  which
          thumbnails are generated for the live session.

          recordingMode -> (string)
              Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

          targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
              The  targeted  thumbnail-generation interval in seconds. This is
              configurable (and required) only if recordingMode is INTERVAL  .
              Default: 60.
                 Important: Setting a value for targetIntervalSeconds does not
                 guarantee that thumbnails  are  generated  at  the  specified
                 interval.  For thumbnails to be generated at the targetInter-
                 valSeconds interval, the IDR/Keyframe  value  for  the  input
                 video  must be less than the targetIntervalSeconds value. See
                 Amazon IVS Streaming Configuration for information on setting
                 IDR/Keyframe  to  the recommended value in video-encoder set-
                 tings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          recordingMode=string,targetIntervalSeconds=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "recordingMode": "DISABLED"|"INTERVAL",
            "targetIntervalSeconds": long
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a RecordingConfiguration resource

       The following create-recording-configuration example creates Recording-
       Configuration resource to enable recording to Amazon S3.

          aws ivs create-recording-configuration \
              --name test-recording-config \
              --destination-configuration S3={bucketName=demo-recording-bucket}

       Output:

          {
              "recordingConfiguration": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ",
                  "name": "test-recording-config",
                  "destinationConfiguration": {
                      "s3": {
                          "bucketName": "demo-recording-bucket"
                      }
                  },
                  "state": "CREATING",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

              Recording-configuration ARN.

          destinationConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information  about  where  recorded
              video will be stored.

              s3 -> (structure)
                 An S3 destination configuration where recorded videos will be
                 stored.

                 bucketName -> (string)
                     Location (S3 bucket name) where recorded videos  will  be
                     stored.

              Recording-configuration  name.  The  value  does  not need to be
              unique.

              Indicates the current state of the recording configuration. When
              the state is ACTIVE , the configuration is ready for recording a
              channel stream.

          tags -> (map)
              Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          thumbnailConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  complex  type that allows you to enable/disable the recording
              of thumbnails for a live session  and  modify  the  interval  at
              which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

              recordingMode -> (string)
                 Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

              targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
                 The  targeted  thumbnail-generation interval in seconds. This
                 is configurable  (and  required)  only  if  recordingMode  is
                 INTERVAL . Default: 60.
                     Important: Setting a value for targetIntervalSeconds does
                     not guarantee that thumbnails are generated at the speci-
                     fied interval. For thumbnails to be generated at the tar-
                     getIntervalSeconds interval, the IDR/Keyframe  value  for
                     the  input video must be less than the targetIntervalSec-
                     onds value. See Amazon IVS  Streaming  Configuration  for
                     information  on  setting  IDR/Keyframe to the recommended
                     value in video-encoder settings.
