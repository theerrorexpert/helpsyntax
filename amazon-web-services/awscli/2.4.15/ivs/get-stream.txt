GET-STREAM()                                                      GET-STREAM()



NAME
       get-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the active (live) stream on a specified channel.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-stream
          --channel-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          Channel ARN for stream to be accessed.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a stream

       The following get-stream example gets information about the stream  for
       the specified channel.

          aws ivs get-stream \
              --channel-arn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh

       Output:

          {
              "stream": {
                  "channelArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "startTime": "2020-05-05T21:55:38Z",
                  "state": "LIVE",
                  "health": "HEALTHY",
                  "viewerCount": 1
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       stream -> (structure)
          channelArn -> (string)
              Channel ARN for the stream.

          health -> (string)
              The streams health.

          playbackUrl -> (string)
              URL of the master playlist, required by the video player to play
              the HLS stream.

          startTime -> (timestamp)
              Time  of  the  streams  start.  This  is  an  ISO 8601 timestamp
              returned as a string.

          state -> (string)
              The streams state.

          streamId -> (string)
              Unique identifier for a live or previously live  stream  in  the
              specified channel.

          viewerCount -> (long)
              A count of concurrent views of the stream. Typically, a new view
              appears in viewerCount within 15 seconds of when video  playback
              starts and a view is removed from viewerCount within 1 minute of
              when video playback ends. A  value  of  -1  indicates  that  the
              request timed out; in this case, retry.
