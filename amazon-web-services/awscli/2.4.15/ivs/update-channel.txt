UPDATE-CHANNEL()                                              UPDATE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       update-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a  channel's  configuration.  This  does not affect an ongoing
       stream of this channel. You must stop and restart the  stream  for  the
       changes to take effect.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-channel
          --arn <value>
          [--authorized | --no-authorized]
          [--latency-mode <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--recording-configuration-arn <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the channel to be updated.

       --authorized | --no-authorized (boolean)
          Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback authorization).

       --latency-mode (string)
          Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and deliver live video
          up  to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with viewers.
          (Note: In the Amazon IVS  console,  LOW  and  NORMAL  correspond  to
          Ultra-low and Standard, respectively.)

          Possible values:

          o NORMAL

          o LOW

       --name (string)
          Channel name.

       --recording-configuration-arn (string)
          Recording-configuration  ARN.  If  this  is  set to an empty string,
          recording is disabled. A value other than an empty string  indicates
          that recording is enabled

       --type (string)
          Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate.
          If you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate, the stream proba-
          bly will disconnect immediately . Valid values:

          o STANDARD  :  Multiple  qualities  are  generated from the original
            input, to automatically give viewers the best experience for their
            devices  and network conditions. Resolution can be up to 1080p and
            bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio is transcoded only for rendi-
            tions 360p and below; above that, audio is passed through.

          o BASIC  :  Amazon  IVS  delivers the original input to viewers. The
            viewers video-quality choice is limited  to  the  original  input.
            Resolution can be up to 480p and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps.

          Possible values:

          o BASIC

          o STANDARD

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To update a channel's configuration information

       The  following update-channel example updates the channel configuration
       for a specified channel ARN to change the channel name. This  does  not
       affect an ongoing stream of this channel; you must stop and restart the
       stream for the changes to take effect.

          aws ivs update-channel \
              --arn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh \
              --name "channel-1"

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "channel-1",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "type": "STANDARD",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "",

       Example 2: To update a channel's configuration to enable recording

       The  following update-channel example updates the channel configuration
       for a specified channel ARN to enable recording. This does  not  affect
       an ongoing stream of this channel; you must stop and restart the stream
       for the changes to take effect.

          aws ivs update-channel \
              --arn "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh" \

       Example 3: To update a channel's configuration to disable recording

       The  following update-channel example updates the channel configuration
       for a specified channel ARN to disable recording. This does not  affect
       an ongoing stream of this channel; you must stop and restart the stream
       for the changes to take effect.

          aws ivs update-channel \
              --arn "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh" \
