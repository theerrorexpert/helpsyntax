GET-CHANNEL()                                                    GET-CHANNEL()



NAME
       get-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the channel configuration for the specified channel ARN. See also
       BatchGetChannel .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-channel
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the channel for which the configuration is to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a channel's configuration information

       The following get-channel example gets the channel configuration for  a
       specified channel ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

          aws ivs get-channel \
              --arn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "channel-1",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "type": "STANDARD",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABCD12cdEFgh",
                  "ingestEndpoint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6.global-contribute.live-video.net",
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

       Video Service User Guide.

OUTPUT
       channel -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Channel ARN.

          authorized -> (boolean)
              Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback  authoriza-
              tion). Default: false .

          ingestEndpoint -> (string)
              Channel  ingest  endpoint,  part  of the definition of an ingest
              server, used when you set up streaming software.

          latencyMode -> (string)
              Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and  deliver  live
              video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with
              viewers. Default: LOW . (Note: In the Amazon  IVS  console,  LOW
              and  NORMAL correspond to Ultra-low and Standard, respectively.)

          name -> (string)
              Channel name.

          playbackUrl -> (string)
              Channel playback URL.

          recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
              Recording-configuration ARN. A value other than an empty  string
              indicates  that recording is enabled. Default: "" (empty string,
              recording is disabled).

          tags -> (map)
              Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          type -> (string)
              Channel  type,  which  determines  the  allowable resolution and
              bitrate. If you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate,  the
              stream probably will disconnect immediately. Default: STANDARD .
              Valid values:

              o STANDARD : Multiple qualities are generated from the  original
                input,  to  automatically give viewers the best experience for
                their devices and network conditions. Resolution can be up  to
                1080p  and  bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio is transcoded
                only for renditions 360p  and  below;  above  that,  audio  is
                passed through.

              o BASIC : Amazon IVS delivers the original input to viewers. The
                viewers video-quality choice is limited to the original input.
                Resolution  can  be  up  to  480p and bitrate can be up to 1.5
                Mbps.
