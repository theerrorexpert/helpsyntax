GET-STREAM-SESSION()                                      GET-STREAM-SESSION()



NAME
       get-stream-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets metadata on a specified stream.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-stream-session
          --channel-arn <value>
          [--stream-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          ARN of the channel resource

       --stream-id (string)
          Unique identifier for a live or previously live stream in the speci-
          fied channel. If no streamId is  provided,  this  returns  the  most
          recent stream session for the channel, if it exists.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       streamSession -> (structure)
          List of stream details.

          channel -> (structure)
              The properties of the channel at the time of going live.

              arn -> (string)
                 Channel ARN.

              authorized -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  channel is private (enabled for playback autho-
                 rization). Default: false .

              ingestEndpoint -> (string)
                 Channel ingest endpoint, part of the definition of an  ingest
                 server, used when you set up streaming software.

              latencyMode -> (string)
                 Channel  latency  mode.  Use  NORMAL to broadcast and deliver
                 live video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interac-
                 tion  with  viewers.  Default: LOW . (Note: In the Amazon IVS
                 console, LOW and NORMAL correspond to Ultra-low and Standard,
                 respectively.)

              name -> (string)
                 Channel name.

              playbackUrl -> (string)
                 Channel playback URL.

              recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration  ARN.  A  value  other  than an empty
                 string indicates  that  recording  is  enabled.  Default:  ""
                 (empty string, recording is disabled).

              tags -> (map)
                 Array   of   1-50   maps,  each  of  the  form  string:string
                 (key:value) .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 Channel type, which determines the allowable  resolution  and
                 bitrate.  If  you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate,
                 the stream probably  will  disconnect  immediately.  Default:
                 STANDARD . Valid values:

                 o STANDARD : Multiple qualities are generated from the origi-
                   nal input, to automatically give viewers the  best  experi-
                   ence  for  their devices and network conditions. Resolution
                   can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio
                   is  transcoded  only  for  renditions 360p and below; above
                   that, audio is passed through.

                 o BASIC : Amazon IVS delivers the original input to  viewers.
                   The viewers video-quality choice is limited to the original
                   input. Resolution can be up to 480p and bitrate can  be  up
                   to 1.5 Mbps.

          endTime -> (timestamp)
              UTC  ISO-8601  formatted  timestamp  of  when  the  channel went
              offline. For live streams, this is NULL .

          ingestConfiguration -> (structure)
              The properties of the incoming RTMP stream for the stream.

                 avcProfile -> (string)
                     Indicates  to  the  decoder the requirements for decoding
                     the stream. For definitions of the valid values, see  the
                     H.264 specification.

                 codec -> (string)

              The properties of recording the live stream.

              arn -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration ARN.

              destinationConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about where recorded
                 video will be stored.

                 s3 -> (structure)
                     An S3 destination  configuration  where  recorded  videos
                     will be stored.

                     bucketName -> (string)
                        Location  (S3  bucket name) where recorded videos will
                        be stored.

              name -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration name. The value does not need  to  be
                 unique.

              state -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  current state of the recording configuration.
                 When the state is ACTIVE , the  configuration  is  ready  for
                 recording a channel stream.

              tags -> (map)
                 Array   of   1-50   maps,  each  of  the  form  string:string
                 (key:value) .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              thumbnailConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A complex type that allows you to enable/disable the  record-
                 ing  of thumbnails for a live session and modify the interval
                 at which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

                 recordingMode -> (string)
                     Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

                 targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
                     The targeted thumbnail-generation  interval  in  seconds.
                     This is configurable (and required) only if recordingMode
                     is INTERVAL . Default: 60.
                        Important: Setting a value  for  targetIntervalSeconds
                        does  not  guarantee  that thumbnails are generated at
                        the specified interval. For thumbnails to be generated
                        at    the    targetIntervalSeconds    interval,    the
                        IDR/Keyframe value for the input video  must  be  less
                        than  the  targetIntervalSeconds value. See Amazon IVS
                        Streaming Configuration  for  information  on  setting
                        IDR/Keyframe to the recommended value in video-encoder
                        settings.

              UTC ISO-8601 formatted timestamp of when the channel went  live.

          streamId -> (string)

              specified channel.

          truncatedEvents -> (list)
              List of Amazon IVS events that the stream encountered. The  list
              is  sorted  by most recent events and contains up to 500 events.

              IVS .
