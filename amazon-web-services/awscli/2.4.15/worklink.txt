NAME
       worklink -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access to
       internal websites and web apps from iOS and Android phones. In a single
       step,  your  users,  such as employees, can access internal websites as
       efficiently as they access any other public website. They enter  a  URL
       in  their  web  browser,  or choose a link to an internal website in an
       email. Amazon WorkLink authenticates the  user's  access  and  securely
       renders  authorized  internal web content in a secure rendering service
       in the AWS cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn't download or store any  inter-
       nal web content on mobile devices.
