DELETE-DEVICE()                                                DELETE-DEVICE()



NAME
       delete-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing device. You must first disassociate the device from
       any links and customer gateways.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-device
          --global-network-id <value>
          --device-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --device-id (string)
          The ID of the device.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a device

       The following delete-device example deletes the specified  device  from
       the specified global network.

          aws networkmanager delete-device \
              --global-network-id global-network-01231231231231231 \
              --device-id device-07f6fd08867abc123 \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "Device": {
                  "DeviceId": "device-07f6fd08867abc123",

                  "GlobalNetworkId": "global-network-01231231231231231",
