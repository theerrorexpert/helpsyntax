ASSOCIATE-CONNECT-PEER()                              ASSOCIATE-CONNECT-PEER()



NAME
       associate-connect-peer -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a  core  network Connect peer with a device and optionally,
       with a link.

       If you specify a link, it must be associated with the specified device.
       You  can  only associate core network Connect peers that have been cre-
       ated on a core network Connect attachment on a core network.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-connect-peer
          --global-network-id <value>
          --connect-peer-id <value>
          --device-id <value>
          [--link-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of your global network.

       --connect-peer-id (string)
          The ID of the Connect peer.

       --device-id (string)
          The ID of the device.

       --link-id (string)
          The ID of the link.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConnectPeerAssociation -> (structure)
          The response to the Connect peer request.

          ConnectPeerId -> (string)

          GlobalNetworkId -> (string)
              The ID of the global network.

          DeviceId -> (string)
              The ID of the device to connect to.

          LinkId -> (string)
              The ID of the link.

          State -> (string)
