CREATE-CONNECT-PEER()                                    CREATE-CONNECT-PEER()



NAME
       create-connect-peer -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  core network connect peer for a specified core network con-
       nect attachment between a core  network  and  an  appliance.  The  peer
       address  and transit gateway address must be the same IP address family
       (IPv4 or IPv6).

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --connect-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the connection attachment.

       --core-network-address (string)
          A Connect peer core network address.

       --peer-address (string)
          The Connect peer address.

       --bgp-options (structure)
          The Connect peer BGP options.

          PeerAsn -> (long)
              The Peer ASN of the BGP.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PeerAsn=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PeerAsn": long
          }

       --inside-cidr-blocks (list)
          The inside IP addresses used for BGP peering.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags associated with the peer request.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          The client token associated with the request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
