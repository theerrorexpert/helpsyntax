GET-NETWORK-RESOURCES()                                GET-NETWORK-RESOURCES()



NAME
       get-network-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the network resources for the specified global network.

       The  results  include  information from the corresponding Describe call
       for the resource, minus any sensitive information  such  as  pre-shared
       keys.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-network-resources  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: NetworkResources

          The resource type.

          The following are the supported resource types for Direct Connect:

          o dx-gateway - The definition model is DirectConnectGateway .

          o dx-vif - The definition model is VirtualInterface .

          The following are the supported resource types for Network Manager:

          o connection - The definition model is Connection .

          o device - The definition model is Device .

          o link - The definition model is Link .

          o site - The definition model is Site .

          The following are the supported resource types for Amazon VPC:

          o customer-gateway - The definition model is CustomerGateway .

          o transit-gateway - The definition model is TransitGateway .

          o transit-gateway-attachment   -    The    definition    model    is
            TransitGatewayAttachment .

          o transit-gateway-connect-peer    -    The   definition   model   is
            TransitGatewayConnectPeer .

          o transit-gateway-route-table   -   The    definition    model    is
            TransitGatewayRouteTable .

          o vpn-connection - The definition model is VpnConnection .

       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the resource.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
