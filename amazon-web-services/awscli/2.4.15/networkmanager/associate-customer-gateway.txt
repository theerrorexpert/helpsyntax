ASSOCIATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()                      ASSOCIATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()



NAME
       associate-customer-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a  customer  gateway  with  a device and optionally, with a
       link. If you specify a link, it must be associated with  the  specified
       device.

       You  can  only  associate customer gateways that are connected to a VPN
       attachment on a transit gateway. The transit gateway must be registered
       in  your  global network. When you register a transit gateway, customer
       gateways that are connected to the transit  gateway  are  automatically
       included in the global network. To list customer gateways that are con-
       nected to a transit gateway, use the DescribeVpnConnections EC2 API and
       filter by transit-gateway-id .

       You  cannot  associate a customer gateway with more than one device and
       link.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-customer-gateway
          --customer-gateway-arn <value>
          --global-network-id <value>
          --device-id <value>
          [--link-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --customer-gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer gateway.

       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --device-id (string)
          The ID of the device.

       --link-id (string)
          The ID of the link.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate a customer gateway

       The following associate-customer-gateway  example  associates  customer
       gateway  cgw-11223344556677889  in  the  specified  global network with
       device device-07f6fd08867abc123.

          aws networkmanager associate-customer-gateway \
              --customer-gateway-arn arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:customer-gateway/cgw-11223344556677889  \
              --global-network-id global-network-01231231231231231 \
              --device-id device-07f6fd08867abc123 \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "CustomerGatewayAssociation": {
                  "CustomerGatewayArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:customer-gateway/cgw-11223344556677889",
                  "GlobalNetworkId": "global-network-01231231231231231",
                  "DeviceId": "device-07f6fd08867abc123",
                  "State": "PENDING"
              }
          }
