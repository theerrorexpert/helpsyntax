NAME
       create-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a connection between two devices. The devices can be a physical
       or virtual appliance that connects to a third-party appliance in a VPC,
       or  a physical appliance that connects to another physical appliance in
       an on-premises network.

SYNOPSIS
            create-connection
          --global-network-id <value>
          --device-id <value>
          --connected-device-id <value>
          [--link-id <value>]
          [--connected-link-id <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --device-id (string)
          The ID of the first device in the connection.

       --connected-device-id (string)
          The ID of the second device in the connection.

       --link-id (string)
          The ID of the link for the first device.

       --connected-link-id (string)
          The ID of the link for the second device.

       --description (string)
          A description of the connection.

          Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to apply to the resource during creation.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
