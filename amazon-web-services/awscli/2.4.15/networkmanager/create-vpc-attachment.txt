OPTIONS
       --core-network-id (string)
          The ID of a core network for the VPC attachment.

       --vpc-arn (string)
          The ARN of the VPC.

       --subnet-arns (list)
          The subnet ARN of the VPC attachment.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --options (structure)
          Options for the VPC attachment.

          Ipv6Support -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether IPv6 is supported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Ipv6Support=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Ipv6Support": true|false
          }

       --tags (list)
          The key-value tags associated with the request.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          The client token associated with the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
