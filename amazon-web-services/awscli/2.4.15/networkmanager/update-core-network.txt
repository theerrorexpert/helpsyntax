UPDATE-CORE-NETWORK()                                    UPDATE-CORE-NETWORK()



NAME
       update-core-network -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the description of a core network.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-core-network
          --core-network-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --core-network-id (string)
          The ID of a core network.

       --description (string)
          The description of the update.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The segments within a core network.

              (structure)
                 Describes a core network segment, which are dedicated routes.
                 Only  attachments  within  this  segment can communicate with
                 each other.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of a core network segment.

                 EdgeLocations -> (list)
                     The Regions where the edges are located.

                     (string)

                 SharedSegments -> (list)
                     The shared segments of a core network.

                     (string)

          Edges -> (list)
              The edges within a core network.

              (structure)
                 Describes a core network edge.

                 EdgeLocation -> (string)
                     The Region where a core network edge is located.

                 Asn -> (long)
                     The ASN of a core network edge.

                 InsideCidrBlocks -> (list)
                     The inside IP addresses used for core network edges.

                     (string)

          Tags -> (list)
              The tags associated with a core network.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The tag key.

                     Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The tag value.

                     Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.
