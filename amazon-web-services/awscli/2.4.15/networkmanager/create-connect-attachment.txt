CREATE-CONNECT-ATTACHMENT()                        CREATE-CONNECT-ATTACHMENT()



NAME
       create-connect-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a core network Connect attachment from a specified core network
       attachment.

       A core network Connect attachment is a GRE-based tunnel attachment that
       you  can  use  to  establish a connection between a core network and an
       appliance. A core network  Connect  attachment  uses  an  existing  VPC
       attachment as the underlying transport mechanism.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-connect-attachment
          --core-network-id <value>

          --options <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --core-network-id (string)
          The ID of a core network where you want to create the attachment.

       --edge-location (string)
          The Region where the edge is located.

       --transport-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the attachment between the two connections.

       --options (structure)
          Options for creating an attachment.

          Protocol -> (string)
              The protocol used for the attachment connection.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Protocol=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Protocol": "GRE"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The list of key-value tags associated with the request.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          The client token associated with the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
