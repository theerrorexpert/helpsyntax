NAME
       describe-cluster-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  description  of  the MSK cluster whose Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN) is specified in the request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster-v2
          --cluster-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the cluster.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Information about the provisioned cluster.

              BrokerNodeGroupInfo -> (structure)
                 Information about the brokers.

                 BrokerAZDistribution -> (string)
                     The  distribution  of  broker  nodes  across Availability
                     Zones. This is an optional parameter. If you don't  spec-
                     ify  it,  Amazon  MSK gives it the value DEFAULT. You can
                     also explicitly set this parameter to the value  DEFAULT.
                     No other values are currently allowed.

                     Amazon MSK distributes the broker nodes evenly across the
                     Availability Zones that correspond  to  the  subnets  you
                     provide when you create the cluster.

                     The  list  of subnets to connect to in the client virtual
                     private cloud (VPC). AWS creates elastic  network  inter-
                     faces inside these subnets. Client applications use elas-
                     tic network  interfaces  to  produce  and  consume  data.
                     Client  subnets can't be in Availability Zone us-east-1e.

                     network interfaces in order to specify who can connect to
                     and communicate with the Amazon MSK cluster. If you don't
                     specify  a  security  group,  Amazon MSK uses the default
                     security group associated with the VPC.
