LIST-CLUSTERS()                                                LIST-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       list-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all the MSK clusters in the current Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-clusters  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ClusterInfoList

SYNOPSIS
            list-clusters
          [--cluster-name-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name-filter (string)
          Specify a prefix of the name of the clusters that you want to  list.
          The  service lists all the clusters whose names start with this pre-
          fix.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ClusterInfoList -> (list)
          Information on each of the MSK clusters in the response.

          (structure)
              Returns information about a cluster.

              ActiveOperationArn -> (string)
                 Arn of active cluster operation.

              BrokerNodeGroupInfo -> (structure)
                 Information about the broker nodes.

                 BrokerAZDistribution -> (string)
                     The  distribution  of  broker  nodes  across Availability
                     Zones. This is an optional parameter. If you don't  spec-
                     ify  it,  Amazon  MSK gives it the value DEFAULT. You can
                     also explicitly set this parameter to the value  DEFAULT.
                     No other values are currently allowed.

                     Amazon MSK distributes the broker nodes evenly across the
                     Availability Zones that correspond  to  the  subnets  you
                     provide when you create the cluster.

                 ClientSubnets -> (list)
                     The  list  of subnets to connect to in the client virtual
                     private cloud (VPC). AWS creates elastic  network  inter-
                     faces inside these subnets. Client applications use elas-
                     tic network  interfaces  to  produce  and  consume  data.
                     Client  subnets can't be in Availability Zone us-east-1e.

                     (string)

                     kafka.m5.large,    kafka.m5.xlarge,     kafka.m5.2xlarge,
                     kafka.m5.4xlarge,          kafka.m5.12xlarge,         and
                     kafka.m5.24xlarge.

                 SecurityGroups -> (list)
                     The AWS security groups to  associate  with  the  elastic
                     network interfaces in order to specify who can connect to
                     and communicate with the Amazon MSK cluster. If you don't
                     specify  a  security  group,  Amazon MSK uses the default
                     security group associated with the VPC.

                        possible values.

                        TLS means that client-broker communication is  enabled
                        with TLS only.

                        TLS_PLAINTEXT  means  that client-broker communication
                        is enabled for both TLS-encrypted, as well  as  plain-
                        text data.

                        PLAINTEXT  means  that  client-broker communication is
                        enabled in plaintext only.

                        The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

                     InCluster -> (boolean)
                        When set to true, it indicates that data communication
                        among  the  broker  nodes of the cluster is encrypted.
                        When set to false, the communication happens in plain-
                        text.

                        The default value is true.

              EnhancedMonitoring -> (string)
                 Specifies  which  metrics  are  gathered for the MSK cluster.
                 This property has the  following  possible  values:  DEFAULT,
                 PER_BROKER,  PER_TOPIC_PER_BROKER,  and  PER_TOPIC_PER_PARTI-
                 TION. For a list of the metrics associated with each of these
                 levels of monitoring, see Monitoring .

                        JMX Exporter.

                        EnabledInBroker -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether you want to turn on or turn  off

                     NodeExporter -> (structure)
                        Indicates  whether you want to turn on or turn off the
