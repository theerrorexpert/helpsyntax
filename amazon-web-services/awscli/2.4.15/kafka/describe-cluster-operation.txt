NAME
       describe-cluster-operation -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a description of the cluster operation specified by the ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster-operation
          --cluster-operation-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-operation-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that uniquely identifies the MSK
          cluster operation.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 EncryptionInTransit -> (structure)
                     The details for encryption in transit.

                     ClientBroker -> (string)
                        Indicates  the  encryption setting for data in transit
                        between clients and brokers.  The  following  are  the
                        possible values.

                        TLS  means that client-broker communication is enabled
                        with TLS only.

                        TLS_PLAINTEXT means that  client-broker  communication
                        is  enabled  for both TLS-encrypted, as well as plain-
                        text data.

                        PLAINTEXT means that  client-broker  communication  is
                        enabled in plaintext only.

                        The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

                     InCluster -> (boolean)
                        When set to true, it indicates that data communication
                        among the broker nodes of the  cluster  is  encrypted.
                        When set to false, the communication happens in plain-
                        text.

                        The default value is true.

              ConnectivityInfo -> (structure)
                 Information about the broker access configuration.

                 PublicAccess -> (structure)
                     Public access control for brokers.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The value DISABLED indicates  that  public  access  is
                        turned  off. SERVICE_PROVIDED_EIPS indicates that pub-
                        lic access is turned on.
