LIST-CLUSTER-OPERATIONS()                            LIST-CLUSTER-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-cluster-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of all the operations that have been performed on the
       specified MSK cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-cluster-operations is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ClusterOperationInfoList

SYNOPSIS
            list-cluster-operations
          --cluster-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the cluster.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            enabled with TLS only.

                            TLS_PLAINTEXT means that client-broker  communica-
                            tion is enabled for both TLS-encrypted, as well as

                            is enabled in plaintext only.

                            The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

                            happens in plaintext.

                            the possible values.

                            TLS  means  that  client-broker  communication  is
                            enabled with TLS only.

                            TLS_PLAINTEXT means that client-broker  communica-
                            tion is enabled for both TLS-encrypted, as well as
                            plaintext data.

                            PLAINTEXT means that  client-broker  communication
                            is enabled in plaintext only.

                            The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

                        InCluster -> (boolean)
                            When  set to true, it indicates that data communi-
                            cation among the broker nodes of  the  cluster  is
                            encrypted.  When  set  to false, the communication
                            happens in plaintext.

                            The default value is true.

                        Type -> (string)

                            turned  off.  SERVICE_PROVIDED_EIPS indicates that
                            public access is turned on.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response of ListClusterOperations is truncated, it returns  a
          NextToken in the response. This Nexttoken should be sent in the sub-
          sequent request to ListClusterOperations.
