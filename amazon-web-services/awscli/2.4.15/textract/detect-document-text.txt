DETECT-DOCUMENT-TEXT()                                  DETECT-DOCUMENT-TEXT()



NAME
       detect-document-text -

DESCRIPTION
       Detects text in the input document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of
       text and the words that make up a line of text. The input document must
       be  an  image  in  JPEG  or  PNG format. DetectDocumentText returns the
       detected text in an array of  Block objects.

       Each document page has as an associated Block of type PAGE.  Each  PAGE
       Block  object  is  the  parent of LINE Block objects that represent the
       lines of detected text on a page. A LINE Block object is a  parent  for
       each  word  that  makes  up  the  line.  Words are represented by Block
       objects of type WORD.
          DetectDocumentText is a synchronous operation. To analyze  documents
          asynchronously, use  StartDocumentTextDetection .

       For more information, see Document Text Detection .

SYNOPSIS
            detect-document-text
          --document <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --document (structure)
          The  input  document as base64-encoded bytes or an Amazon S3 object.
          If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, you can't
          pass  image bytes. The document must be an image in JPEG or PNG for-
          mat.

          If you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract,  you  might  not
          need  to  base64-encode  image bytes that are passed using the Bytes
          field.

          Bytes -> (blob)
              A blob of base64-encoded document bytes. The maximum size  of  a
              document  that's  provided in a blob of bytes is 5 MB. The docu-
              ment bytes must be in PNG or JPEG format.

              If you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon  Textract,  you  might
              not  need  to  base64-encode  image bytes passed using the Bytes
              field.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              Identifies an S3 object as the document source. The maximum size
              of a document that's stored in an S3 bucket is 5 MB.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  name  of the S3 bucket. Note that the # character is not
                 valid in the file name.

              Name -> (string)
                 The file name of the input document.  Synchronous  operations
                 can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format. Asynchro-
                 nous operations also support PDF and TIFF format files.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket has versioning enabled,  you  can  specify  the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bytes": blob,
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detect text in a document

       The  following  detect-document-text The following example shows how to
       detect text in a document.

       Linux/macOS:

          aws textract detect-document-text \
              --document '{"S3Object":{"Bucket":"bucket","Name":"document"}}'

       Windows:

          aws textract detect-document-text \
              --document "{\"S3Object\":{\"Bucket\":\"bucket\",\"Name\":\"document\"}}" \
              --region region-name

OUTPUT
       DocumentMetadata -> (structure)
          Metadata  about  the  document. It contains the number of pages that
          are detected in the document.

          Pages -> (integer)
              The number of pages that are detected in the document.

       Blocks -> (list)
          An array of Block objects that contain the text that's  detected  in
          the document.

          (structure)
              A  Block  represents  items  that  are  recognized in a document
              within a group of pixels close to each  other.  The  information
              returned  in a Block object depends on the type of operation. In
              text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText ),
              you  get information about the detected words and lines of text.
              In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you  can  also
              get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements
              that are detected in the document.

              An array of Block objects is returned by  both  synchronous  and
              asynchronous  operations.  In  synchronous  operations,  such as
              DetectDocumentText , the array of Block objects  is  the  entire
              set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumen-
              tAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

              For more information, see How Amazon Textract Works .

              BlockType -> (string)
                 The type of text item that's recognized.  In  operations  for
                 text detection, the following types are returned:

                 o PAGE  -  Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are
                   detected on a document page.

                 o WORD - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or
                   more  ISO  basic  Latin script characters that aren't sepa-
                   rated by spaces.

                 o LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
                   detected on a document page.

                 In   text   analysis  operations,  the  following  types  are
                 returned:

                 o PAGE - Contains a list of  child  Block  objects  that  are
                   detected on a document page.

                 o KEY_VALUE_SET  - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for
                   linked text that's detected on a  document  page.  Use  the
                   EntityType  field to determine if a KEY_VALUE_SET object is
                   a KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.

                 o WORD - A word that's detected on a document page. A word is
                   one  or  more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't
                   separated by spaces.

                 o LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
                   detected on a document page.

                 o TABLE - A table that's detected on a document page. A table
                   is grid-based information with two or more rows or columns,
                   with a cell span of one row and one column each.

                 o CELL - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the par-
                   ent of the block that contains the text in the cell.

                 o SELECTION_ELEMENT - A selection element such as  an  option
                   button  (radio  button) or a check box that's detected on a
                   document page. Use the value of SelectionStatus  to  deter-
                   mine the status of the selection element.

              Confidence -> (float)
                 The confidence score that Amazon Textract has in the accuracy
                 of the recognized text  and  the  accuracy  of  the  geometry
                 points around the recognized text.

              Text -> (string)
                 The  word  or  line  of text that's recognized by Amazon Tex-
                 tract.

              TextType -> (string)
                 The kind of text that Amazon Textract has detected. Can check
                 for handwritten text and printed text.

              RowIndex -> (integer)
                 The row in which a table cell is located. The first row posi-
                 tion is 1. RowIndex isn't returned by DetectDocumentText  and
                 GetDocumentTextDetection .

              ColumnIndex -> (integer)
                 The  column  in  which a table cell appears. The first column
                 position is 1. ColumnIndex isn't returned by  DetectDocument-
                 Text and GetDocumentTextDetection .

              RowSpan -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  rows that a table cell spans. Currently this
                 value is always 1, even if the  number  of  rows  spanned  is
                 greater  than 1. RowSpan isn't returned by DetectDocumentText
                 and GetDocumentTextDetection .

              ColumnSpan -> (integer)
                 The number of columns that a table cell spans. Currently this
                 value  is  always 1, even if the number of columns spanned is
                 greater than 1. ColumnSpan isn't returned by  DetectDocument-
                 Text and GetDocumentTextDetection .

              Geometry -> (structure)
                 The location of the recognized text on the image. It includes
                 an axis-aligned, coarse bounding box that surrounds the text,
                 and  a finer-grain polygon for more accurate spatial informa-
                 tion.

                 BoundingBox -> (structure)
                     An axis-aligned coarse representation of the location  of
                     the recognized item on the document page.

                     Width -> (float)
                        The  width of the bounding box as a ratio of the over-
                        all document page width.

                     Height -> (float)
                        The height of the bounding box as a ratio of the over-
                        all document page height.

                     Left -> (float)
                        The  left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of
                        overall document page width.

                     Top -> (float)
                        The top coordinate of the bounding box as a  ratio  of
                        overall document page height.

                 Polygon -> (list)
                     Within  the  bounding  box, a fine-grained polygon around
                     the recognized item.

                     (structure)
                        The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page.
                        The X and Y values that are returned are ratios of the
                        overall document page size. For example, if the  input
                        document  is 700 x 200 and the operation returns X=0.5
                        and Y=0.25, then the point is at  the  (350,50)  pixel
                        coordinate on the document page.

                        An  array  of  Point objects, Polygon , is returned by
                        DetectDocumentText . Polygon represents a fine-grained
                        polygon  around  detected  text. For more information,
                        see Geometry in the Amazon Textract Developer Guide.

                            The value of the X coordinate for  a  point  on  a
                            Polygon .

                        Y -> (float)
                            The  value  of  the  Y coordinate for a point on a
                            Polygon .

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier for the recognized  text.  The  identifier  is
                 only unique for a single operation.

              Relationships -> (list)
                 A  list  of child blocks of the current block. For example, a
                 LINE object has child blocks for each WORD block that's  part
                 of the line of text. There aren't Relationship objects in the
                 list for relationships that don't exist,  such  as  when  the
                 current  block  has no child blocks. The list size can be the
                 following:

                 o 0 - The block has no child blocks.

                 o 1 - The block has child blocks.

                 (structure)
                     Information about how blocks are related to each other. A
                     Block  object  contains  0  or more Relation objects in a
                     list, Relationships . For more information, see  Block  .

                     The  Type  element  provides the type of the relationship
                     for all blocks in the IDs array.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of relationship that the blocks  in  the  IDs
                        array  have  with  the current block. The relationship
                        can be VALUE or CHILD . A relationship of  type  VALUE
                        is  a  list  that  contains  the ID of the VALUE block
                        that's associated with the KEY of a key-value pair.  A
                        relationship of type CHILD is a list of IDs that iden-
                        tify WORD blocks in the case of lines Cell  blocks  in
                        the  case  of  Tables,  and WORD blocks in the case of
                        Selection Elements.

                     Ids -> (list)
                        An array of IDs for related blocks. You  can  get  the
                        type of the relationship from the Type element.

                        (string)

              EntityTypes -> (list)
                 The type of entity. The following can be returned:

                 o KEY - An identifier for a field on the document.

                 o VALUE - The field text.
                     EntityTypes isn't returned by DetectDocumentText and Get-
                     DocumentTextDetection .

                 (string)

              SelectionStatus -> (string)
                 The selection status of  a  selection  element,  such  as  an
                 option button or check box.

              Page -> (integer)
                 The  page  on which a block was detected. Page is returned by
                 asynchronous operations. Page values greater than 1 are  only
                 returned for multipage documents that are in PDF or TIFF for-
                 mat. A scanned image (JPEG/PNG), even if it contains multiple
                 document  pages,  is considered to be a single-page document.
                 The value of Page is always 1. Synchronous  operations  don't
                 return  Page because every input document is considered to be
                 a single-page document.
