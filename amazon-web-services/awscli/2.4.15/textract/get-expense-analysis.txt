GET-EXPENSE-ANALYSIS()                                  GET-EXPENSE-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       get-expense-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  results  for  an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that
       analyzes invoices and receipts. Amazon Textract finds contact  informa-
       tion,  items  purchased,  and  vendor  name,  from  input  invoices and
       receipts.

       You start asynchronous invoice/receipt analysis  by  calling   StartEx-
       penseAnalysis  ,  which returns a job identifier (JobId ). Upon comple-
       tion of the invoice/receipt analysis,  Amazon  Textract  publishes  the
       completion  status  to  the  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
       SNS) topic. This topic must be registered in the initial call to Start-
       ExpenseAnalysis  .  To  get the results of the invoice/receipt analysis
       operation, first ensure that the status value published to  the  Amazon
       SNS  topic is SUCCEEDED . If so, call GetExpenseAnalysis , and pass the
       job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartExpenseAnalysis .

       Use  the  MaxResults  parameter  to limit the number of blocks that are
       returned. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults ,  the
       value  of  NextToken  in  the  operation response contains a pagination
       token for getting the next set of results. To  get  the  next  page  of
       results,  call  GetExpenseAnalysis , and populate the NextToken request
       parameter with the token value that's returned from the  previous  call
       to GetExpenseAnalysis .

SYNOPSIS
            get-expense-analysis
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  text  detection  job.  The JobId is
          returned from StartExpenseAnalysis . A JobId value is only valid for
          7 days.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  to return per paginated call. The
          largest value you can specify is 20. If you specify a value  greater
          than  20,  a maximum of 20 results is returned. The default value is
          20.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was  incomplete  (because  there  are  more
          blocks  to  retrieve), Amazon Textract returns a pagination token in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of blocks.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DocumentMetadata -> (structure)
          Information  about  a document that Amazon Textract processed. Docu-
          mentMetadata is returned in every page of paginated  responses  from

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response  is truncated, Amazon Textract returns this token.
          You can use this token in the subsequent  request  to  retrieve  the
          next set of text-detection results.
