ANALYZE-ID()                                                      ANALYZE-ID()



NAME
       analyze-id -

DESCRIPTION
       Analyzes  identity documents for relevant information. This information
       is extracted and returned as  IdentityDocumentFields  ,  which  records
       both the normalized field and value of the extracted text.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            analyze-id
          --document-pages <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --document-pages (list)
          The document being passed to AnalyzeID.

          (structure)
              The input document, either as bytes or as an S3 object.

              You  pass  image  bytes  to  an Amazon Textract API operation by
              using the Bytes property. For example, you would use  the  Bytes
              property  to  pass  a  document loaded from a local file system.
              Image bytes passed by using the Bytes property  must  be  base64
              encoded.  Your code might not need to encode document file bytes
              if you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon  Textract  API  opera-
              tions.

              You pass images stored in an S3 bucket to an Amazon Textract API
              operation by using the S3Object property. Documents stored in an
              S3 bucket don't need to be base64 encoded.

              The  AWS  Region  for  the S3 bucket that contains the S3 object
              must match the AWS Region that you use for Amazon Textract oper-
              ations.

              If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, pass-
              ing image bytes using the Bytes property  isn't  supported.  You
              must  first upload the document to an Amazon S3 bucket, and then
              call the operation using the S3Object property.

              For Amazon Textract to process an S3 object, the user must  have
              permission to access the S3 object.

              Bytes -> (blob)
                 A  blob of base64-encoded document bytes. The maximum size of
                 a document that's provided in a blob of bytes is  5  MB.  The
                 document bytes must be in PNG or JPEG format.

                 If you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might
                 not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the  Bytes
                 field.

              S3Object -> (structure)
                 Identifies  an  S3 object as the document source. The maximum
                 size of a document that's stored in an S3 bucket is 5 MB.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket. Note that the #  character  is
                     not valid in the file name.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  file  name of the input document. Synchronous opera-
                     tions can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format.
                     Asynchronous  operations also support PDF and TIFF format
                     files.

                 Version -> (string)
                     If the bucket has versioning enabled, you can specify the
                     object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Bytes": blob,
              "S3Object": {
                "Bucket": "string",
                "Name": "string",
                "Version": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
