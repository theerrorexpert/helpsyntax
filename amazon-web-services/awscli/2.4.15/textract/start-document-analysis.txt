START-DOCUMENT-ANALYSIS()                            START-DOCUMENT-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       start-document-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the asynchronous analysis of an input document for relationships
       between detected items such as key-value pairs, tables,  and  selection
       elements.
          StartDocumentAnalysis  can  analyze  text  in  documents that are in
          JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and PDF format. The documents are stored in an Ama-
          zon  S3 bucket. Use  DocumentLocation to specify the bucket name and
          file name of the document.

          StartDocumentAnalysis returns a job identifier (JobId ) that you use
          to get the results of the operation. When text analysis is finished,
          Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the  Amazon  Simple
          Notification  Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in Notifi-
          cationChannel . To get the results of the text  analysis  operation,
          first  check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic
          is SUCCEEDED . If so, call  GetDocumentAnalysis , and pass  the  job
          identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartDocumentAnalysis .

       For more information, see Document Text Analysis .

          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--output-config <value>]

OPTIONS
       --document-location (structure)
          The location of the document to be processed.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the input document.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket. Note that the # character  is  not
                 valid in the file name.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  file  name of the input document. Synchronous operations
                 can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format. Asynchro-
                 nous operations also support PDF and TIFF format files.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the  bucket  has  versioning enabled, you can specify the
                 object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --feature-types (list)
          A list of the types of analysis to perform. Add TABLES to  the  list
          to  return  information  about  the  tables that are detected in the
          input document. Add FORMS to return detected form data.  To  perform
          both  types  of analysis, add TABLES and FORMS to FeatureTypes . All
          lines and words  detected  in  the  document  are  included  in  the
          response (including text that isn't related to the value of Feature-
          Types ).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TABLES
            FORMS

       --client-request-token (string)
          The idempotent token that you use to identify the start request.  If
          you use the same token with multiple StartDocumentAnalysis requests,
          the same JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken  to  prevent  the
          same  job  from  being accidentally started more than once. For more
          information, see Calling Amazon Textract Asynchronous Operations .

       --job-tag (string)
          An identifier that you specify that's  included  in  the  completion
          notification published to the Amazon SNS topic. For example, you can
          use JobTag to identify the type  of  document  that  the  completion
          notification corresponds to (such as a tax form or a receipt).

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The  Amazon  SNS  topic ARN that you want Amazon Textract to publish
          the completion status of the operation to.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The Amazon SNS topic that Amazon Textract posts  the  completion
              status to.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that gives Amazon
              Textract publishing permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --output-config (structure)
          Sets if the output will go to a customer defined bucket. By default,
          Amazon  Textract  will save the results internally to be accessed by
          the GetDocumentAnalysis operation.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the bucket your output will go to.

          S3Prefix -> (string)
              The prefix of the object key that the output will be  saved  to.
              When not enabled, the prefix will be textract_output".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Prefix": "string"
          }

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  KMS  key  used to encrypt the inference results. This can be in
          either Key ID or Key Alias format. When a KMS key is  provided,  the
          KMS  key  will  be used for server-side encryption of the objects in
          the customer bucket. When this parameter is not enabled, the  result
          will be encrypted server side,using SSE-S3.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start analyzing text in a multi-page document

       The  following start-document-analysis example shows how to start asyn-
       chronous analysis of text in a multi-page document.

       Linux/macOS:

          aws textract start-document-analysis \
              --document-location '{"S3Object":{"Bucket":"bucket","Name":"document"}}' \
              --feature-types '["TABLES","FORMS"]' \
              --notification-channel "SNSTopicArn=arn:snsTopic,RoleArn=roleArn"

       Windows:

          aws textract start-document-analysis \
              --document-location "{\"S3Object\":{\"Bucket\":\"bucket\",\"Name\":\"document\"}}" \
              --feature-types "[\"TABLES\", \"FORMS\"]" \
              --region region-name \
              --notification-channel "SNSTopicArn=arn:snsTopic,RoleArn=roleArn"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "df7cf32ebbd2a5de113535fcf4d921926a701b09b4e7d089f3aebadb41e0712b"
          }

       For more information, see Detecting and Analyzing  Text  in  Multi-Page
       Documents in the Amazon Textract Developers Guide

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The  identifier  for  the  document text detection job. Use JobId to
          identify the job in a subsequent call  to  GetDocumentAnalysis  .  A
          JobId value is only valid for 7 days.
