DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Attaches an IAM policy to the specified resource.  The  only  supported
       use for this action is to share a RuleGroup across accounts.

       The PutPermissionPolicy is subject to the following restrictions:

       o You can attach only one policy with each PutPermissionPolicy request.

       o The policy must include an Effect , Action and Principal .

       o Effect must specify Allow .

       o The   Action   in   the   policy   must   be    waf:UpdateWebACL    ,
         waf-regional:UpdateWebACL        ,        waf:GetRuleGroup        and
         waf-regional:GetRuleGroup . Any extra or wildcard actions in the pol-
         icy will be rejected.

       o The policy cannot include a Resource parameter.

       o The  ARN  in  the  request  must be a valid WAF RuleGroup ARN and the
         RuleGroup must exist in the same region.

       o The user making the request must be the owner of the RuleGroup.

       o Your policy must be composed using IAM Policy version 2012-10-17.

       For more information, see IAM Policies .

       An example of a valid policy parameter is shown in the Examples section
       below.

SYNOPSIS
            put-permission-policy
          --resource-arn <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the RuleGroup to which you want to
          attach the policy.

       --policy (string)
          The policy to attach to the specified RuleGroup.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
