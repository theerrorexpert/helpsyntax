NAME
       update-xss-match-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  XssMatchTuple objects (filters) in an   XssMatchSet
       . For each XssMatchTuple object, you specify the following values:

       o Action  : Whether to insert the object into or delete the object from
         the array. To change an  XssMatchTuple  ,  you  delete  the  existing
         object and add a new one.

       o FieldToMatch  :  The  part  of  web requests that you want AWS WAF to
         inspect and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header or custom  query
         parameter, the name of the header or parameter.

       o TextTransformation : Which text transformation, if any, to perform on
         the web request before inspecting the request for cross-site  script-
         ing  attacks.  You  can only specify a single type of TextTransforma-
         tion.

       You use XssMatchSet objects to specify which CloudFront  requests  that
       you  want  to  allow, block, or count. For example, if you're receiving
       requests that contain cross-site scripting attacks in the request  body
       and  you want to block the requests, you can create an XssMatchSet with
       the applicable settings, and  then  configure  AWS  WAF  to  block  the
       requests.

       To create and configure an XssMatchSet , perform the following steps:

       o Submit a  CreateXssMatchSet request.

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateIPSet request.

       o Submit an UpdateXssMatchSet request  to  specify  the  parts  of  web
         requests  that  you  want AWS WAF to inspect for cross-site scripting
         attacks.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest
                     version, AWS WAF  has  a  single  set  of  endpoints  for
                     regional and global use.

              Specifies the part of a web request that you want to inspect for
              cross-site scripting attacks and indicates whether you  want  to
              add  the  specification  to an  XssMatchSet or delete it from an
              XssMatchSet .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specify INSERT to add an  XssMatchSetUpdate to an   XssMatch-
                 Set  . Use DELETE to remove an XssMatchSetUpdate from an Xss-
                 MatchSet .

              XssMatchTuple -> (structure)
                 Specifies the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF  to
                 inspect for cross-site scripting attacks and, if you want AWS
                 WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header.

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     Specifies where in a web request to look  for  cross-site
                     scripting attacks.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want AWS WAF to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER  :  A  specified request header, for example,
                          the value of the User-Agent or  Referer  header.  If
                          you  choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated  the  type
                          of  operation  that the request is asking the origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods:  DELETE  ,  GET  , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part  of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI  :  The  part of a web request that identifies a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as the HTTP request body, such as data from a  form.
                          The  request  body  immediately  follows the request
                          headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of  the
                          request  body  are  forwarded to AWS WAF for inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of  the  body, you can create a size constraint set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                          rather  than  inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value  or  regex pattern that you specify in Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When the value of Type is HEADER , enter the  name  of
                        the  header that you want AWS WAF to search, for exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for  example,  UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text transformations eliminate some of the  unusual  for-
                     matting  that  attackers use in web requests in an effort
                     to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a  transformation,  AWS
                     WAF  performs  the  transformation on FieldToMatch before
                     inspecting it for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When  you're  concerned  that  attackers are injecting an
                     operating system command line command and  using  unusual
                     formatting  to  disguise  some or all of the command, use
                     this option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use this option to replace the following characters  with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use this option to replace HTML-encoded  characters  with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with  a  non-breaking  space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces  characters  that  are  represented in decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE

                     Use  this  option  to  convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                     lowercase (a-z).
                        URL_DECODE

                     Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.
                        NONE

                     Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text trans-
                     formations.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action=string,XssMatchTuple={FieldToMatch={Type=string,Data=string},TextTransformation=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": "INSERT"|"DELETE",
              "XssMatchTuple": {
                "FieldToMatch": {
                  "Type": "URI"|"QUERY_STRING"|"HEADER"|"METHOD"|"BODY"|"SINGLE_QUERY_ARG"|"ALL_QUERY_ARGS",
                  "Data": "string"
                },
                "TextTransformation": "NONE"|"COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE"|"HTML_ENTITY_DECODE"|"LOWERCASE"|"CMD_LINE"|"URL_DECODE"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update an XSSMatchSet

       The  following  update-xss-match-set  command  deletes an XssMatchTuple
       object (filters) in an XssMatchSet:

          aws waf update-xss-match-set --xss-match-set-id a123fae4-b567-8e90-1234-5ab67ac8ca90 --change-token 12cs345-67cd-890b-1cd2-c3a4567d89f1 --updates Action="DELETE",XssMatchTuple={FieldToMatch={Type="QUERY_STRING"},TextTransformation="URL_DECODE"}

       For more information, see Working with Cross-site Scripting Match  Con-
       ditions in the AWS WAF developer guide.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The  ChangeToken  that  you  used  to  submit  the UpdateXssMatchSet
          request. You can also use this value to  query  the  status  of  the
          request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
