DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  RuleGroup that is specified by the  RuleGroupId  that  you
       included in the GetRuleGroup request.

       To view the rules in a rule group, use  ListActivatedRulesInRuleGroup .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rule-group
          --rule-group-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-group-id (string)
          The RuleGroupId of the  RuleGroup that you want to get.  RuleGroupId
          is returned by  CreateRuleGroup and by  ListRuleGroups .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RuleGroup -> (structure)
          Information  about the  RuleGroup that you specified in the GetRule-
          Group request.

          RuleGroupId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a RuleGroup . You use RuleGroupId to get
              more  information about a RuleGroup (see  GetRuleGroup ), update
              a RuleGroup (see  UpdateRuleGroup ), insert a RuleGroup  into  a
              WebACL  or  delete  a one from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or
              delete a RuleGroup from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRuleGroup ).
                 RuleGroupId is returned by  CreateRuleGroup and by  ListRule-
                 Groups .

          Name -> (string)
              The  friendly  name or description for the RuleGroup . You can't
              change the name of a RuleGroup after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A friendly name or description for the metrics  for  this  Rule-
              Group  . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z,
              a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum  length  one.  It
              can't  contain  whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF,
              including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the  name
              of the metric after you create the RuleGroup .
