DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  XssMatchSet objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-xss-match-sets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: XssMatchSets

SYNOPSIS
            list-xss-match-sets
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more  XssMatchSet objects than the number that you spec-
          ified  for  Limit in the request, the response includes a NextMarker
          value. To list more XssMatchSet  objects,  submit  another  ListXss-
          MatchSets  request,  and  specify  the  NextMarker  value  from  the
          response in the NextMarker value in the next request.

       XssMatchSets -> (list)
          An array of  XssMatchSetSummary objects.

                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              The Id and Name of an XssMatchSet .

              XssMatchSetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for an XssMatchSet .  You  use  XssMatch-
                 SetId  to  get  information about a XssMatchSet (see  GetXss-
                 MatchSet ), update an XssMatchSet (see  UpdateXssMatchSet  ),
                 insert  an  XssMatchSet into a Rule or delete one from a Rule
                 (see  UpdateRule ), and delete an XssMatchSet  from  AWS  WAF
                 (see  DeleteXssMatchSet ).
                     XssMatchSetId  is  returned  by  CreateXssMatchSet and by
                     ListXssMatchSets .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the XssMatchSet , if any, specified by Id .
