       update-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  Predicate objects in a Rule . Each Predicate object
       identifies  a  predicate,  such  as a  ByteMatchSet or an  IPSet , that
       specifies the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count.  If
       you add more than one predicate to a Rule , a request must match all of
       the specifications to be allowed, blocked,  or  counted.  For  example,
       suppose that you add the following to a Rule :

       o A ByteMatchSet that matches the value BadBot in the User-Agent header

       o An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44

       You then add the Rule to a WebACL and specify that you  want  to  block
       requests  that  satisfy  the  Rule  .  For a request to be blocked, the
       User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot  and the
       request must originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44.

       To create and configure a Rule , perform the following steps:

       o Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the Rule
         .

       o Create the Rule . See  CreateRule .

       o Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you  provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateRule request.

       o Submit an UpdateRule request to add predicates to the Rule .

       o Create and update a WebACL that contains the Rule . See  CreateWebACL
         .

       If you want to replace one ByteMatchSet  or  IPSet  with  another,  you
       delete the existing one and add the new one.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            update-rule
          --rule-id <value>
          --change-token <value>
          --updates <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-id (string)
          The RuleId of the Rule that you want to update. RuleId  is  returned
          by CreateRule and by  ListRules .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --updates (list)
          An  array  of  RuleUpdate  objects  that  you want to insert into or
          delete from a  Rule . For more information, see the applicable  data
          types:

          o RuleUpdate : Contains Action and Predicate

          o Predicate : Contains DataId , Negated , and Type

          o FieldToMatch : Contains Data and Type

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest
                     version, AWS WAF  has  a  single  set  of  endpoints  for
                     regional and global use.

              Specifies  a Predicate (such as an IPSet ) and indicates whether
              you want to add it to a Rule or delete it from a Rule .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specify INSERT to add a Predicate to a Rule . Use  DELETE  to
                 remove a Predicate from a Rule .

              Predicate -> (structure)
                 The  ID of the Predicate (such as an IPSet ) that you want to
                 add to a Rule .

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or  count requests based on the settings in the specified
                     ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet  ,   Xss-
                     MatchSet  ,   RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an  IPSet  includes  the  IP
                     address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or block requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a  request  based  on the negation of the settings in the
                     ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet  ,   Xss-
                     MatchSet  ,   RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an  IPSet  includes  the  IP
                     address  192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow, block, or count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of predicate in a Rule , such  as  ByteMatch  or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A  unique  identifier for a predicate in a Rule , such as
                     ByteMatchSetId or IPSetId . The ID  is  returned  by  the
                     corresponding Create or List command.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action=string,Predicate={Negated=boolean,Type=string,DataId=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": "INSERT"|"DELETE",
              "Predicate": {
                "Negated": true|false,
                "Type": "IPMatch"|"ByteMatch"|"SqlInjectionMatch"|"GeoMatch"|"SizeConstraint"|"XssMatch"|"RegexMatch",
                "DataId": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a rule

       The  following  update-rule  command   deletes  a Predicate object in a
       rule:

          aws waf update-rule --rule-id a123fae4-b567-8e90-1234-5ab67ac8ca90 --change-token 12cs345-67cd-890b-1cd2-c3a4567d89f1 --updates Action="DELETE",Predicate={Negated=false,Type="ByteMatch",DataId="MyByteMatchSetID"}

       For more information, see Working with Rules in the AWS  WAF  developer
       guide.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The  ChangeToken that you used to submit the UpdateRule request. You
          can also use this value to query the status of the request. For more
          information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
