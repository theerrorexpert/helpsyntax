       update-web-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  ActivatedRule objects in a WebACL . Each Rule iden-
       tifies  web  requests that you want to allow, block, or count. When you
       update a WebACL , you specify the following values:

       o A default action for the WebACL , either ALLOW or  BLOCK  .  AWS  WAF
         performs  the  default action if a request doesn't match the criteria
         in any of the Rules in a WebACL .

       o The Rules that you want to add or delete. If you want to replace  one
         Rule  with another, you delete the existing Rule and add the new one.

       o For each Rule , whether you want AWS WAF  to  allow  requests,  block
         requests, or count requests that match the conditions in the Rule .

       o The order in which you want AWS WAF to evaluate the Rules in a WebACL
         . If you add more than one Rule to a WebACL , AWS WAF evaluates  each
         request  against  the Rules in order based on the value of Priority .
         (The Rule that has the lowest value for Priority is evaluated first.)
         When  a web request matches all the predicates (such as ByteMatchSets
         and IPSets ) in a Rule , AWS WAF immediately takes the  corresponding
         action,  allow or block, and doesn't evaluate the request against the
         remaining Rules in the WebACL , if any.

       To create and configure a WebACL , perform the following steps:

       o Create and update the predicates that you want to include in Rules  .
         For more information, see  CreateByteMatchSet ,  UpdateByteMatchSet ,
         CreateIPSet  ,   UpdateIPSet  ,   CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet  ,   and
         UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet .

       o Create  and update the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL .
         For more information, see  CreateRule and  UpdateRule .

       o Create a WebACL . See  CreateWebACL .

       o Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you  provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateWebACL request.

       o Submit  an UpdateWebACL request to specify the Rules that you want to
         include in the WebACL , to specify the default action, and  to  asso-
         ciate  the  WebACL with a CloudFront distribution.  The ActivatedRule
         can be a rule group. If you specify a rule group  as  your  Activate-
         dRule  ,  you can exclude specific rules from that rule group. If you
         already have a rule group associated with a web ACL and want to  sub-
         mit  an  UpdateWebACL request to exclude certain rules from that rule
         group, you must first remove the rule group from  the  web  ACL,  the
         re-insert  it  again, specifying the excluded rules. For details, see
         ActivatedRule$ExcludedRules .

       Be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL  without
       setting  the  rule type when first creating the rule, the  UpdateWebACL
       request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule  (the
       default rule type) with the specified ID, which does not exist.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            update-web-acl
          --web-acl-id <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--updates <value>]
          [--default-action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --web-acl-id (string)
          The WebACLId of the  WebACL that you want  to  update.  WebACLId  is
          returned by  CreateWebACL and by  ListWebACLs .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --updates (list)
          An array of updates to make to the  WebACL .

          An  array  of  WebACLUpdate  objects that you want to insert into or
          delete from a  WebACL . For more  information,  see  the  applicable
          data types:

          o WebACLUpdate : Contains Action and ActivatedRule

          o ActivatedRule  :  Contains  Action  ,  OverrideAction , Priority ,
            RuleId , and Type . ActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when
            updating  or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you do
            not use ActivatedRule|Action .  For  all  other  update  requests,
            ActivatedRule|Action  is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAc-
            tion .

          o WafAction : Contains Type

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              Specifies whether to insert a Rule into or delete a Rule from  a
              WebACL .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specifies whether to insert a Rule into or delete a Rule from
                 a WebACL .

              ActivatedRule -> (structure)
                 The ActivatedRule object in an  UpdateWebACL  request  speci-
                 fies  a  Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority
                 of the Rule in the WebACL , and the action that you want  AWS
                 WAF  to  take  when  a  web request matches the Rule (ALLOW ,
                 BLOCK , or COUNT ).

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Specifies the order in which the Rules in  a  WebACL  are
                     evaluated.  Rules  with  a  lower  value for Priority are
                     evaluated before Rules with a  higher  value.  The  value
                     must  be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to a
                     WebACL , the values don't need to be consecutive.

                 RuleId -> (string)
                     The RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more infor-
                     mation  about  a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a Rule (see
                     UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one
                     from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from
                     AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).
                        RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules  .

                 Action -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the  action  that  CloudFront or AWS WAF takes
                     when a web request matches the conditions in the  Rule  .
                     Valid values for Action include the following:

                     o ALLOW  : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

                     o BLOCK : CloudFront responds with an HTTP  403  (Forbid-
                       den) status code.

                     o COUNT  :  AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that
                       match the conditions in the rule and then continues  to
                       inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in
                       the web ACL.
                        ActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when  updat-
                        ing  or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case,
                        you do not use ActivatedRule|Action .  For  all  other
                        update  requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead
                        of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to  requests
                        that  match  the  settings  in a Rule . Valid settings
                        include the following:

                        o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

                        o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

                        o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests
                          that  match  all  of the conditions in the rule. AWS
                          WAF then continues to inspect the web request  based
                          on  the  remaining  rules  in the web ACL. You can't
                          specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL  .

                 OverrideAction -> (structure)
                     Use the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .

                     Any  rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request.
                     If you set the OverrideAction to  None  ,  the  RuleGroup
                     will  block a request if any individual rule in the Rule-
                     Group matches the request and is configured to block that
                     request.  However if you first want to test the RuleGroup
                     , set the OverrideAction to Count .  The  RuleGroup  will
                     then  override  any  block action specified by individual
                     rules contained within the  group.  Instead  of  blocking
                     matching  requests,  those  requests will be counted. You
                     can view a record of counted requests  using   GetSample-
                     dRequests .
                        ActivatedRule|OverrideAction  applies only when updat-
                        ing or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In  this  case
                        you  do  not  use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other
                        update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used  instead
                        of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .

                     Type -> (string)
                        COUNT overrides the action specified by the individual
                        rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the  rule's
                        action will take place.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  rule  type,  either  REGULAR , as defined by  Rule ,
                     RATE_BASED , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as
                     defined  by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although
                     this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a
                     RATE_BASED  rule  to  a web ACL without setting the type,
                     the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because  the  request
                     tries  to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which
                     does not exist.

                 ExcludedRules -> (list)
                     An array of rules to exclude from a rule group.  This  is
                     applicable  only when the ActivatedRule refers to a Rule-
                     Group .

                     Sometimes it is necessary  to  troubleshoot  rule  groups
                     that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives).
                     One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific
                     rule  within  the rule group that is blocking the legiti-
                     mate traffic and then disable (exclude)  that  particular
                     rule.  You  can  exclude  rules  from  both your own rule
                     groups and AWS Marketplace rule  groups  that  have  been
                     associated with a web ACL.

                     Specifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from
                     the rule group. Rather, it changes  the  action  for  the
                     rules  to  COUNT  .  Therefore,  requests  that  match an
                     ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked.  The  RuleGroup
                     owner  will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .

                     If you want to exclude rules from a rule  group  that  is
                     already  associated with a web ACL, perform the following
                     steps:

                     o Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of  the  rules
                       that  you  want  to exclude. For more information about
                       the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .

                     o Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

                       o The first action deletes the existing rule group from
                         the  web  ACL. That is, in the  UpdateWebACL request,
                         the  first  Updates:Action  should  be   DELETE   and
                         Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group
                         that contains the rules that you want to exclude.

                       o The second action inserts the same  rule  group  back
                         in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the
                         second   Updates:Action   should    be    INSERT    ,
                         Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group
                         that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should  con-
                         tain the rules that you want to exclude.

                        The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is  appli-
                        cable  only  when  the ActivatedRule refers to a Rule-
                        Group . The rule must belong to the RuleGroup that  is
                        specified by the ActivatedRule .

                        RuleId -> (string)
                            The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from
                            the rule group.

       --default-action (structure)
          A default action for the web ACL, either ALLOW  or  BLOCK.  AWS  WAF
          performs  the default action if a request doesn't match the criteria
          in any of the rules in a web ACL.

          Type -> (string)
              Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match
              the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:

              o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

              o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

              o COUNT  :  AWS  WAF  increments  a counter of the requests that
                match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then  contin-
                ues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in
                the web ACL. You can't specify COUNT for  the  default  action
                for a WebACL .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "BLOCK"|"ALLOW"|"COUNT"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To update a web ACL

       The following update-web-acl command deletes an ActivatedRule object in
       a WebACL.

          aws waf update-web-acl
