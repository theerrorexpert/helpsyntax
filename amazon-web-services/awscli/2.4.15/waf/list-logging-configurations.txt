DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  LoggingConfiguration objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-logging-configurations is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: LoggingConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            list-logging-configurations
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LoggingConfigurations -> (list)
          An array of  LoggingConfiguration objects.

              The Amazon Kinesis Data  Firehose,  RedactedFields  information,
              and the web ACL Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you want
                 to associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

              LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
                 An array of Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose ARNs.

                 (string)

              RedactedFields -> (list)
                 The parts of the request that  you  want  redacted  from  the
                 logs. For example, if you redact the cookie field, the cookie
                 field in the firehose will be xxx .

                            With  the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set
                            of endpoints for regional and global use.

                     Specifies where in a web request to look for TargetString
                     .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want AWS WAF to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER  :  A  specified request header, for example,
                          the value of the User-Agent or  Referer  header.  If
                          you  choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated  the  type
                          of  operation  that the request is asking the origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods:  DELETE  ,  GET  , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part  of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI  :  The  part of a web request that identifies a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as the HTTP request body, such as data from a  form.
                          The  request  body  immediately  follows the request
                          headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of  the
                          request  body  are  forwarded to AWS WAF for inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of  the  body, you can create a size constraint set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                          rather  than  inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value  or  regex pattern that you specify in Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When the value of Type is HEADER , enter the  name  of
                        the  header that you want AWS WAF to search, for exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for  example,  UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more LoggingConfigurations  than  the  number  that  you
          specified  for  Limit  in  the  request,  the  response  includes  a
          NextMarker  value.  To  list  more  LoggingConfigurations  ,  submit
          another   ListLoggingConfigurations   request,   and   specify   the
          NextMarker value from the response in the NextMarker  value  in  the
          next request.
