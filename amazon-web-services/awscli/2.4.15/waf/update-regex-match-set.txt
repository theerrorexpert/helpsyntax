NAME
       update-regex-match-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  RegexMatchTuple objects (filters) in a  RegexMatch-
       Set  .  For  each RegexMatchSetUpdate object, you specify the following
       values:

       o Whether to insert or delete the object from the array. If you want to
         change  a  RegexMatchSetUpdate object, you delete the existing object
         and add a new one.

       o The part of a web request that you want  AWS  WAF  to  inspectupdate,
         such as a query string or the value of the User-Agent header.

       o The  identifier  of  the pattern (a regular expression) that you want
         AWS WAF to look for. For more information, see  RegexPatternSet .

       o Whether to perform any conversions on the request, such as converting
         it to lowercase, before inspecting it for the specified string.

       For example, you can create a RegexPatternSet that matches any requests
       with User-Agent headers that contain the string B[a@]dB[o0]t . You  can
       then configure AWS WAF to reject those requests.

       To create and configure a RegexMatchSet , perform the following steps:

       o Create  a RegexMatchSet. For more information, see  CreateRegexMatch-
         Set .

       o Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateRegexMatchSet request.

       o Submit  an  UpdateRegexMatchSet  request  to  specify the part of the
         request that you want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header  or
         the  URI)  and the identifier of the RegexPatternSet that contain the
         regular expression patters you want AWS WAF to watch for.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --regex-match-set-id (string)
          The  RegexMatchSetId  of the  RegexMatchSet that you want to update.
          RegexMatchSetId  is  returned   by    CreateRegexMatchSet   and   by
          ListRegexMatchSets .

       --updates (list)
          An array of RegexMatchSetUpdate objects that you want to insert into
          or delete from a  RegexMatchSet . For more information, see   Regex-
          MatchTuple .

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest
                     version, AWS WAF  has  a  single  set  of  endpoints  for
                     regional and global use.

              In  an   UpdateRegexMatchSet request, RegexMatchSetUpdate speci-
              fies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple and includes
              the settings for the RegexMatchTuple .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple .

              RegexMatchTuple -> (structure)
                 Information about the part of a web request that you want AWS
                 WAF to inspect and the identifier of the  regular  expression
                 (regex)  pattern  that you want AWS WAF to search for. If you
                 specify DELETE for the value of Action , the  RegexMatchTuple
                 values  must  exactly match the values in the RegexMatchTuple
                 that you want to delete from the RegexMatchSet .

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     Specifies where in a web request to look for  the  Regex-
                     PatternSet .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want AWS WAF to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER  :  A  specified request header, for example,
                          the value of the User-Agent or  Referer  header.  If
                          you  choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated  the  type
                          of  operation  that the request is asking the origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods:  DELETE  ,  GET  , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part  of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI  :  The  part of a web request that identifies a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as the HTTP request body, such as data from a  form.
                          The  request  body  immediately  follows the request
                          headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of  the
                          request  body  are  forwarded to AWS WAF for inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of  the  body, you can create a size constraint set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                          rather  than  inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value  or  regex pattern that you specify in Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When the value of Type is HEADER , enter the  name  of
                        the  header that you want AWS WAF to search, for exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for  example,  UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text transformations eliminate some of the  unusual  for-
                     matting  that  attackers use in web requests in an effort
                     to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a  transformation,  AWS
                     WAF performs the transformation on RegexPatternSet before
                     inspecting a request for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When  you're  concerned  that  attackers are injecting an
                     operating system commandline command  and  using  unusual
                     formatting  to  disguise  some or all of the command, use
                     this option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use this option to replace the following characters  with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use this option to replace HTML-encoded  characters  with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with  a  non-breaking  space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces  characters  that  are  represented in decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE

                     Use  this  option  to  convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                     lowercase (a-z).
                        URL_DECODE

                     Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.
                        NONE

                     Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text trans-
                     formations.

                 RegexPatternSetId -> (string)
                     The  RegexPatternSetId  for  a  RegexPatternSet . You use
                     RegexPatternSetId to get information  about  a  RegexPat-
                     ternSet  (see   GetRegexPatternSet  ), update a RegexPat-
                     ternSet (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a RegexPat-
                     ternSet  into a RegexMatchSet or delete one from a Regex-
                     MatchSet (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ), and delete an  Reg-
                     exPatternSet  from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet ).
                        RegexPatternSetId  is  returned  by    CreateRegexPat-
                        ternSet and by  ListRegexPatternSets .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action=string,RegexMatchTuple={FieldToMatch={Type=string,Data=string},TextTransformation=string,RegexPatternSetId=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": "INSERT"|"DELETE",
              "RegexMatchTuple": {
                "FieldToMatch": {
                  "Type": "URI"|"QUERY_STRING"|"HEADER"|"METHOD"|"BODY"|"SINGLE_QUERY_ARG"|"ALL_QUERY_ARGS",
                  "Data": "string"
                },
                "TextTransformation": "NONE"|"COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE"|"HTML_ENTITY_DECODE"|"LOWERCASE"|"CMD_LINE"|"URL_DECODE",
                "RegexPatternSetId": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The  ChangeToken  that  you  used  to submit the UpdateRegexMatchSet
          request. You can also use this value to  query  the  status  of  the
          request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
