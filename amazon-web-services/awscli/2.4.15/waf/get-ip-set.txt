DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  IPSet that is specified by IPSetId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ip-set
          --ip-set-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ip-set-id (string)
          The IPSetId of the  IPSet that you want to get. IPSetId is  returned
          by  CreateIPSet and by  ListIPSets .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IPSet -> (structure)
          Information  about  the   IPSet  that  you specified in the GetIPSet
          request. For more information, see the following topics:

          o IPSet : Contains IPSetDescriptors , IPSetId , and Name

          o IPSetDescriptors : Contains an array of  IPSetDescriptor  objects.
            Each IPSetDescriptor object contains Type and Value

          IPSetId -> (string)
              The  IPSetId  for  an IPSet . You use IPSetId to get information
              about  an  IPSet  (see   GetIPSet  ),  update  an   IPSet   (see
              UpdateIPSet  ), insert an IPSet into a Rule or delete one from a
              Rule (see  UpdateRule ), and delete an IPSet from AWS  WAF  (see
              DeleteIPSet ).
                 IPSetId is returned by  CreateIPSet and by  ListIPSets .

          Name -> (string)
              A  friendly name or description of the  IPSet . You can't change
              the name of an IPSet after you create it.

          IPSetDescriptors -> (list)
              The IP address type (IPV4 or IPV6 ) and the IP address range (in
              CIDR  notation)  that web requests originate from. If the WebACL
              is associated with a CloudFront distribution and the viewer  did
              not  use  an  HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request,
              this is the value of the c-ip field  in  the  CloudFront  access
              logs.

                        For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2
                        API  and  see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the
                        latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies  the  IP  address  type  (IPV4 or IPV6 ) and the IP
                 address range (in CIDR format) that  web  requests  originate
                 from.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Specify IPV4 or IPV6 .

                 Value -> (string)
                     Specify an IPv4 address by using CIDR notation. For exam-
                     ple:

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
                       that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify
                       192.0.2.44/32 .

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
                       that  originated  from  IP  addresses from 192.0.2.0 to
                       192.0.2.255, specify 192.0.2.0/24 .

                     Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

                     Specify an IPv6 address by using CIDR notation. For exam-
                     ple:

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
                       that     originated     from     the     IP     address
                       1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111,        specify
