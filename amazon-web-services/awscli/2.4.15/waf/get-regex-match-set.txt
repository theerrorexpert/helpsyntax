       get-regex-match-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  RegexMatchSet specified by RegexMatchSetId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-regex-match-set
          --regex-match-set-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --regex-match-set-id (string)
          The RegexMatchSetId of the  RegexMatchSet  that  you  want  to  get.
          RegexMatchSetId   is   returned   by    CreateRegexMatchSet  and  by
          ListRegexMatchSets .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RegexMatchSet -> (structure)
          Information about the   RegexMatchSet  that  you  specified  in  the
          GetRegexMatchSet request. For more information, see  RegexMatchTuple
          .

          RegexMatchSetId -> (string)
              The RegexMatchSetId for a RegexMatchSet .  You  use  RegexMatch-
              SetId  to  get information about a RegexMatchSet (see  GetRegex-
              MatchSet ), update a RegexMatchSet (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet  ),
              insert  a  RegexMatchSet  into  a Rule or delete one from a Rule
              (see  UpdateRule ), and delete a RegexMatchSet from AWS WAF (see
              DeleteRegexMatchSet ).
                 RegexMatchSetId  is  returned  by  CreateRegexMatchSet and by
                 ListRegexMatchSets .

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description of the  RegexMatchSet . You can't
              change Name after you create a RegexMatchSet .

          RegexMatchTuples -> (list)
              Contains  an array of  RegexMatchTuple objects. Each RegexMatch-
              Tuple object contains:

              o The part of a web request that you want AWS  WAF  to  inspect,
                such  as a query string or the value of the User-Agent header.

              o The identifier of the pattern (a regular expression) that  you
                want AWS WAF to look for. For more information, see  RegexPat-
                ternSet .

              o Whether to perform any conversions on  the  request,  such  as
                converting it to lowercase, before inspecting it for the spec-
                ified string.

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 The regular expression pattern  that  you  want  AWS  WAF  to
                 search for in web requests, the location in requests that you
                 want AWS WAF to search, and other settings. Each  RegexMatch-
                 Tuple object contains:

                 o The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect,
                   such as a query string  or  the  value  of  the  User-Agent
                   header.

                 o The  identifier  of the pattern (a regular expression) that
                   you want AWS WAF to look for.  For  more  information,  see
                   RegexPatternSet .

                 o Whether  to perform any conversions on the request, such as
                   converting it to lowercase, before inspecting  it  for  the
                   specified string.

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     Specifies  where  in a web request to look for the Regex-
                     PatternSet .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The part of the web request that you want AWS  WAF  to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER : A specified request  header,  for  example,
                          the  value  of  the User-Agent or Referer header. If
                          you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name  of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD  :  The HTTP method, which indicated the type
                          of operation that the request is asking  the  origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD ,  OPTIONS  ,  PATCH  ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING  : A query string, which is the part of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI : The part of a web request  that  identifies  a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as  the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
                          The request body  immediately  follows  the  request
                          headers.  Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the
                          request body are forwarded to AWS  WAF  for  inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of the body, you can create a size  constraint  set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that  you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS  :  Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but
                          rather than inspecting a single parameter,  AWS  WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value or regex pattern that you specify  in  Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When  the  value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of
                        the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for  exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for example, UserName or SalesRegion .  The  parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text  transformations  eliminate some of the unusual for-
                     matting that attackers use in web requests in  an  effort
                     to  bypass  AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS
                     WAF performs the transformation on RegexPatternSet before
                     inspecting a request for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When you're concerned that  attackers  are  injecting  an
                     operating  system  commandline  command and using unusual
                     formatting to disguise some or all of  the  command,  use
                     this option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use  this option to replace the following characters with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use  this  option to replace HTML-encoded characters with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces  (ampersand)nbsp;  with  a non-breaking space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces characters that  are  represented  in  decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE

                     Use this option to convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                     lowercase (a-z).
                        URL_DECODE

                     Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.
                        NONE

                     Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text trans-
                     formations.

                 RegexPatternSetId -> (string)
                     The RegexPatternSetId for a  RegexPatternSet  .  You  use
                     RegexPatternSetId  to  get  information about a RegexPat-
                     ternSet (see  GetRegexPatternSet ),  update  a  RegexPat-
                     ternSet (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a RegexPat-
                     ternSet into a RegexMatchSet or delete one from a  Regex-
                     MatchSet  (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ), and delete an Reg-
                     exPatternSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet  ).
                        RegexPatternSetId   is  returned  by   CreateRegexPat-
                        ternSet and by  ListRegexPatternSets .



                                                         GET-REGEX-MATCH-SET()
