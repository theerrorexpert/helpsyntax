CREATE-IP-SET()                                                CREATE-IP-SET()



NAME
       create-ip-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates an  IPSet , which you use to specify which  web  requests  that
       you  want to allow or block based on the IP addresses that the requests
       originate from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from
       one  or  more  individual  IP  addresses  or  one  or more ranges of IP
       addresses and you want to block the requests, you can create  an  IPSet
       that  contains  those  IP addresses and then configure AWS WAF to block
       the requests.

       To create and configure an IPSet , perform the following steps:

       o Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateIPSet request.

       o Submit a CreateIPSet request.

       o Use  GetChangeToken  to  get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateIPSet request.

       o Submit an UpdateIPSet request to specify the IP  addresses  that  you
         want AWS WAF to watch for.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-ip-set
          --name <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A friendly name or description of the  IPSet . You can't change Name
          after you create the IPSet .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IPSet -> (structure)
          The  IPSet returned in the CreateIPSet response.

          IPSetId -> (string)
              The  IPSetId  for  an IPSet . You use IPSetId to get information
              about  an  IPSet  (see   GetIPSet  ),  update  an   IPSet   (see
              UpdateIPSet  ), insert an IPSet into a Rule or delete one from a
              Rule (see  UpdateRule ), and delete an IPSet from AWS  WAF  (see
              DeleteIPSet ).
                 IPSetId is returned by  CreateIPSet and by  ListIPSets .

          Name -> (string)
              A  friendly name or description of the  IPSet . You can't change
              the name of an IPSet after you create it.

          IPSetDescriptors -> (list)
              The IP address type (IPV4 or IPV6 ) and the IP address range (in
              CIDR  notation)  that web requests originate from. If the WebACL
              is associated with a CloudFront distribution and the viewer  did
              not  use  an  HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request,
              this is the value of the c-ip field  in  the  CloudFront  access
              logs.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Specify an IPv4 address by using CIDR notation. For exam-
                     ple:

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
                       that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify
                       192.0.2.44/32 .

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
