DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates a  SqlInjectionMatchSet , which you use  to  allow,  block,  or
       count requests that contain snippets of SQL code in a specified part of
       web requests. AWS WAF searches for character sequences that are  likely
       to be malicious strings.

       To  create and configure a SqlInjectionMatchSet , perform the following
       steps:

       o Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet request.

       o Submit a CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet request.

       o Use  GetChangeToken  to  get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet request.

       o Submit an  UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet request to specify the parts of
         web  requests  in  which you want to allow, block, or count malicious
         SQL code.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-sql-injection-match-set
          --name <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  friendly  name  or description for the  SqlInjectionMatchSet that
          you're creating. You can't change Name after you create  the  SqlIn-
          jectionMatchSet .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SqlInjectionMatchSet -> (structure)
          A  SqlInjectionMatchSet .

          SqlInjectionMatchSetId -> (string)
              A  unique identifier for a SqlInjectionMatchSet . You use SqlIn-
              jectionMatchSetId to get information about a  SqlInjectionMatch-
              Set (see  GetSqlInjectionMatchSet ), update a SqlInjectionMatch-
              Set (see  UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet ), insert  a  SqlInjection-
              MatchSet  into a Rule or delete one from a Rule (see  UpdateRule
              ),  and  delete  a  SqlInjectionMatchSet  from  AWS   WAF   (see
              DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet ).
                 SqlInjectionMatchSetId  is  returned  by  CreateSqlInjection-
                 MatchSet and by  ListSqlInjectionMatchSets .

          Name -> (string)
              The name, if any, of the SqlInjectionMatchSet .

          SqlInjectionMatchTuples -> (list)
              Specifies the parts of web requests that you want to inspect for
              snippets of malicious SQL code.

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2
                        API  and  see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the
                        latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies  the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to
                 inspect for snippets of malicious SQL code and, if  you  want
                 AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header.

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     Specifies  where in a web request to look for snippets of
                     malicious SQL code.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The part of the web request that you want AWS  WAF  to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER : A specified request  header,  for  example,
                          the  value  of  the User-Agent or Referer header. If
                          you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name  of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD  :  The HTTP method, which indicated the type
                          of operation that the request is asking  the  origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD ,  OPTIONS  ,  PATCH  ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING  : A query string, which is the part of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI : The part of a web request  that  identifies  a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as  the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
                          The request body  immediately  follows  the  request
                          headers.  Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the
                          request body are forwarded to AWS  WAF  for  inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of the body, you can create a size  constraint  set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that  you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS  :  Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but
                          rather than inspecting a single parameter,  AWS  WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value or regex pattern that you specify  in  Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When  the  value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of
                        the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for  exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for example, UserName or SalesRegion .  The  parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text  transformations  eliminate some of the unusual for-
                     matting that attackers use in web requests in  an  effort
                     to  bypass  AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS
                     WAF performs the transformation  on  FieldToMatch  before
                     inspecting it for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When you're concerned that  attackers  are  injecting  an
                     operating  system  command line command and using unusual
                     formatting to disguise some or all of  the  command,  use
                     this option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use  this option to replace the following characters with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use  this  option to replace HTML-encoded characters with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces  (ampersand)nbsp;  with  a non-breaking space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces characters that  are  represented  in  decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE

                     Use this option to convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                     lowercase (a-z).
                        URL_DECODE

                     Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.
                        NONE

                     Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text trans-
                     formations.

       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the CreateSqlInjectionMatch-
          Set  request. You can also use this value to query the status of the
          request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
