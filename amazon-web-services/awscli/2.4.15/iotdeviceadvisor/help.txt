DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web  Services  IoT  Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully
       managed test capability for validating IoT devices during device  soft-
       ware  development. Device Advisor provides pre-built tests that you can
       use to validate IoT devices for reliable and secure  connectivity  with
       Amazon Web Services IoT Core before deploying devices to production. By
       using Device Advisor, you can confirm that your devices can connect  to
       Amazon  Web  Services  IoT Core, follow security best practices and, if
       applicable, receive software updates from IoT  Device  Management.  You
       can  also download signed qualification reports to submit to the Amazon
       Web Services Partner Network to get your device qualified for the  Ama-
       zon  Web  Services Partner Device Catalog without the need to send your
       device in and wait for it to be tested.
