DESCRIPTION
       Catalog  API  actions  allow  you to manage your entities through list,
       describe, and update capabilities. An entity can be  a  product  or  an
       offer on AWS Marketplace.

       You can automate your entity update process by integrating the AWS Mar-
       ketplace Catalog API with your AWS Marketplace product build or deploy-
       ment pipelines. You can also create your own applications on top of the
       Catalog API to manage your products on AWS Marketplace.
