LIST-CHANGE-SETS()                                          LIST-CHANGE-SETS()



NAME
       list-change-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of change sets owned by the account being used to make
       the call. You can filter this list  by  providing  any  combination  of
       entityId  ,  ChangeSetName  ,  and status. If you provide more than one
       filter, the API operation applies a logical AND between the filters.

       You can describe a change during the 60-day request  history  retention
       period for API calls.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          The catalog related to the request. Fixed value: AWSMarketplace

       --filter-list (list)
          An array of filter objects.

          (structure)
              A filter object, used to optionally filter results from calls to
              the ListEntities and ListChangeSets actions.

              Name -> (string)
                 For ListEntities , the supported value for this is  an  Enti-
                 tyId .

                 For ListChangeSets , the supported values are as follows:

              ValueList -> (list)
                     ListEntities - This is a list of unique EntityId s.

                     ListChangeSets  -  The supported filter names and associ-
                     ated ValueList s is as follows:

                 o ChangeSetName -  The  supported  ValueList  is  a  list  of
                   non-unique ChangeSetName s. These are defined when you call
                   the StartChangeSet action.

                 o Status - The supported ValueList is a list of statuses  for
                   all change set requests.

                 o EntityId  -  The  supported  ValueList  is a list of unique
                   EntityId s.

                 o BeforeStartTime - The supported ValueList is a list of  all
                   change sets that started before the filter value.

                 o AfterStartTime  -  The supported ValueList is a list of all
                   change sets that started after the filter value.

                 o BeforeEndTime - The supported ValueList is a  list  of  all
                   change sets that ended before the filter value.

                 o AfterEndTime  -  The  supported  ValueList is a list of all
                   change sets that ended after the filter value.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,ValueList=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "ValueList": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort (structure)
          An object that contains two attributes, SortBy and SortOrder .

          SortBy -> (string)
              For ListEntities , supported attributes include LastModifiedDate
              (default), Visibility , EntityId , and Name .

              For  ListChangeSets , supported attributes include StartTime and
              EndTime .

          SortOrder -> (string)
              The sorting order. Can be ASCENDING or DESCENDING . The  default
              value is DESCENDING .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SortBy=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SortBy": "string",
            "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results returned by a single call. This value
          must be provided in the next  call  to  retrieve  the  next  set  of
          results. By default, this value is 20.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  value  retrieved from a previous call to access the next
          page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
