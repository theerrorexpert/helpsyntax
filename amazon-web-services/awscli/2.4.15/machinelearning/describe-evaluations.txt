DESCRIBE-EVALUATIONS()                                  DESCRIBE-EVALUATIONS()



NAME
       describe-evaluations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of DescribeEvaluations that match the search criteria in
       the request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-evaluations is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Results

OPTIONS
       --filter-variable (string)
          Use  one  of  the  following variable to filter a list of Evaluation
          objects:

          o CreatedAt - Sets the search criteria to  the  Evaluation  creation
            date.

          o Status - Sets the search criteria to the Evaluation status.

          o Name - Sets the search criteria to the contents of Evaluation
            **
            **  Name .

          o IAMUser  -  Sets  the  search  criteria  to  the user account that
            invoked an Evaluation .

          o MLModelId - Sets the search criteria to the MLModel that was eval-
            uated.

          o DataSourceId  - Sets the search criteria to the DataSource used in
            Evaluation .

          o DataUri - Sets the search criteria to the  data  file(s)  used  in
            Evaluation  . The URL can identify either a file or an Amazon Sim-
            ple Storage Solution (Amazon S3) bucket or directory.

          Possible values:

          o CreatedAt

          o LastUpdatedAt

          o Status

          o Name

          o IAMUser

          o MLModelId

          o DataSourceId

          o DataURI

       --eq (string)
          The equal to operator. The Evaluation results will have  FilterVari-
          able values that exactly match the value specified with EQ .

       --gt (string)
          The  greater than operator. The Evaluation results will have Filter-
          Variable values that are greater than the value specified with GT  .

       --lt (string)
          The less than operator. The Evaluation results will have FilterVari-
          able values that are less than the value specified with LT .

       --ge (string)
          The greater than or equal to operator. The Evaluation  results  will
          have  FilterVariable  values  that  are greater than or equal to the
          value specified with GE .

       --le (string)
          The less than or equal to operator. The Evaluation results will have
          FilterVariable values that are less than or equal to the value spec-
          ified with LE .

       --ne (string)
          The not equal to operator. The Evaluation results will have  Filter-
          Variable values not equal to the value specified with NE .

       --prefix (string)
          A  string that is found at the beginning of a variable, such as Name
          or Id .

          For example, an Evaluation could have the Name   2014-09-09-Holiday-
          GiftMailer  .  To  search  for this Evaluation , select Name for the
          FilterVariable and any of the following strings for the Prefix :

          o 2014-09

          o 2014-09-09

          o 2014-09-09-Holiday

       --sort-order (string)
          A two-value parameter that determines the sequence of the  resulting
          list of Evaluation .

          o asc - Arranges the list in ascending order (A-Z, 0-9).

          o dsc - Arranges the list in descending order (Z-A, 9-0).

          Results are sorted by FilterVariable .

          Possible values:

          o asc

          o dsc

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              CreatedByIamUser -> (string)
                 The AWS user account that invoked the evaluation. The account
                 type can be either an AWS root account or an AWS Identity and
                 Access Management (IAM) user account.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  the  Evaluation  was  created.  The  time is
                 expressed in epoch time.

              LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the most recent edit to the Evaluation . The time
                 is expressed in epoch time.

              Name -> (string)
                 A user-supplied name or description of the Evaluation .

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the evaluation. This element can have one of
                 the following values:

                 o PENDING - Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML)  submitted  a
                   request to evaluate an MLModel .

                 o INPROGRESS - The evaluation is underway.

                 o FAILED  - The request to evaluate an MLModel did not run to
                   completion. It is not usable.

                 o COMPLETED - The evaluation process completed  successfully.

                 o DELETED  -  The  Evaluation is marked as deleted. It is not
                   usable.

              PerformanceMetrics -> (structure)
                 Measurements of how well the MLModel performed, using  obser-
                 vations  referenced  by the DataSource . One of the following
                 metrics is returned, based on the type of the MLModel :

                 o BinaryAUC: A binary MLModel uses the Area Under  the  Curve
                   (AUC) technique to measure performance.

                 o RegressionRMSE:  A  regression  MLModel  uses the Root Mean
                   Square Error (RMSE) technique to measure performance.  RMSE
                   measures the difference between predicted and actual values
                   for a single variable.

                 o MulticlassAvgFScore: A multiclass MLModel uses the F1 score
                   technique to measure performance.

                 For  more  information  about performance metrics, please see
                 the Amazon Machine Learning Developer Guide .

                 Properties -> (map)
