CREATE-REALTIME-ENDPOINT()                          CREATE-REALTIME-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-realtime-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  real-time  endpoint for the MLModel . The endpoint contains
       the URI of the MLModel ; that is, the location to send  real-time  pre-
       diction requests for the specified MLModel .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-realtime-endpoint
          --ml-model-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ml-model-id (string)
          The ID assigned to the MLModel during creation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MLModelId -> (string)
          A user-supplied ID that uniquely identifies the MLModel . This value
          should be identical to the value of the MLModelId in the request.

       RealtimeEndpointInfo -> (structure)
          The endpoint information of the MLModel

          PeakRequestsPerSecond -> (integer)
              The maximum processing  rate  for  the  real-time  endpoint  for
              MLModel , measured in incoming requests per second.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that the request to create the real-time endpoint for
              the MLModel was received. The time is expressed in epoch time.

          EndpointUrl -> (string)
              The URI  that  specifies  where  to  send  real-time  prediction
              requests for the MLModel .
                 Note:  The application must wait until the real-time endpoint
                 is ready before using this URI.

          EndpointStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the real-time endpoint for the  MLModel  .
              This element can have one of the following values:

              o NONE - Endpoint does not exist or was previously deleted.

              o READY  -  Endpoint  is  ready to be used for real-time predic-
                tions.

              o UPDATING - Updating/creating the endpoint.
