DESCRIBE-DATA-SOURCES()                                DESCRIBE-DATA-SOURCES()



NAME
       describe-data-sources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  DataSource  that match the search criteria in the
       request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-data-sources is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Results

OPTIONS
       --filter-variable (string)
          Use one of the following variables to filter a list of DataSource :

          o CreatedAt - Sets the search criteria to DataSource creation dates.

          o Status - Sets the search criteria to DataSource statuses.

          o Name - Sets the search criteria  to  the  contents  of  DataSource
            Name .

          o DataUri  -  Sets the search criteria to the URI of data files used
            to create the DataSource . The URI can identify either a  file  or
            an  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or directory.

          o IAMUser - Sets the  search  criteria  to  the  user  account  that
            invoked the DataSource creation.

          Possible values:

          o CreatedAt

          o LastUpdatedAt

          o Status

          o Name

          o DataLocationS3

          o IAMUser

       --eq (string)
          The  equal to operator. The DataSource results will have FilterVari-
          able values that exactly match the value specified with EQ .

       --gt (string)
          The greater than operator. The DataSource results will have  Filter-
          Variable  values that are greater than the value specified with GT .

       --lt (string)
          The less than operator. The DataSource results will have FilterVari-
          able values that are less than the value specified with LT .

       --ge (string)
          The  greater  than or equal to operator. The DataSource results will
          have FilterVariable values that are greater than  or  equal  to  the
          value specified with GE .

       --le (string)
          The less than or equal to operator. The DataSource results will have
          FilterVariable values that are less than or equal to the value spec-
          ified with LE .

       --ne (string)
          The  not equal to operator. The DataSource results will have Filter-
          Variable values not equal to the value specified with NE .

       --prefix (string)
          A string that is found at the beginning of a variable, such as  Name
          or Id .

          For  example,  a DataSource could have the Name  2014-09-09-Holiday-
          GiftMailer . To search for this DataSource ,  select  Name  for  the
          FilterVariable and any of the following strings for the Prefix :

          o 2014-09

          o 2014-09-09

          o 2014-09-09-Holiday

       --sort-order (string)
          A  two-value parameter that determines the sequence of the resulting
          list of DataSource .

          o asc - Arranges the list in ascending order (A-Z, 0-9).

          o dsc - Arranges the list in descending order (Z-A, 9-0).

          Results are sorted by FilterVariable .

          Possible values:

          o asc

          o dsc

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
