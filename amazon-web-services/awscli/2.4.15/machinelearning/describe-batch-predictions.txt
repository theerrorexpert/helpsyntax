NAME
       describe-batch-predictions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of BatchPrediction operations that match the search cri-
       teria in the request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-batch-predictions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Results

OPTIONS
       --filter-variable (string)
          Use  one of the following variables to filter a list of BatchPredic-
          tion :

          o CreatedAt - Sets the search criteria to the  BatchPrediction  cre-
            ation date.

          o Status - Sets the search criteria to the BatchPrediction status.

          o Name  -  Sets the search criteria to the contents of the BatchPre-
            diction
            **
            **  Name .

          o IAMUser - Sets the  search  criteria  to  the  user  account  that
            invoked the BatchPrediction creation.

          o MLModelId  -  Sets  the search criteria to the MLModel used in the
            BatchPrediction .

          o DataSourceId - Sets the search criteria to the DataSource used  in
            the BatchPrediction .

          o DataURI - Sets the search criteria to the data file(s) used in the
            BatchPrediction . The URL can identify either a file or an  Amazon
            Simple Storage Solution (Amazon S3) bucket or directory.

          Possible values:

          o CreatedAt

          o LastUpdatedAt

          o Status

          o Name

          o IAMUser

          o MLModelId

          o DataSourceId

          o DataURI

       --eq (string)
          The equal to operator. The BatchPrediction results will have Filter-
          Variable values that exactly match the value specified with EQ .

       --gt (string)
          The greater than operator. The  BatchPrediction  results  will  have
          FilterVariable values that are greater than the value specified with
          GT .

       --lt (string)
          The less than operator. The BatchPrediction results will  have  Fil-
          terVariable  values that are less than the value specified with LT .

       --ge (string)
          The greater than or equal to operator. The  BatchPrediction  results
          will  have  FilterVariable  values that are greater than or equal to
          the value specified with GE .

       --le (string)
          The less than or equal to operator. The BatchPrediction results will
          have  FilterVariable values that are less than or equal to the value
          specified with LE .

       --ne (string)
          The not equal to operator. The  BatchPrediction  results  will  have
          FilterVariable values not equal to the value specified with NE .

       --prefix (string)
          A  string that is found at the beginning of a variable, such as Name
          or Id .

          For example, a  Batch  Prediction  operation  could  have  the  Name
          2014-09-09-HolidayGiftMailer  . To search for this BatchPrediction ,
          select Name for the FilterVariable and any of the following  strings
          for the Prefix :

          o 2014-09

          o 2014-09-09

          o 2014-09-09-Holiday

       --sort-order (string)
          A  two-value parameter that determines the sequence of the resulting
          list of MLModel s.

          o asc - Arranges the list in ascending order (A-Z, 0-9).

          o dsc - Arranges the list in descending order (Z-A, 9-0).

          Results are sorted by FilterVariable .

          Possible values:

          o asc

          o dsc

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
