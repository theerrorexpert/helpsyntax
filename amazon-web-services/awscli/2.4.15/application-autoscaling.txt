          API Summary

       The Application Auto Scaling service API includes  three  key  sets  of
       actions:

       o Register  and  manage scalable targets - Register Amazon Web Services
         or custom resources as scalable targets (a resource that  Application
         Auto Scaling can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and
         retrieve information on existing scalable targets.

       o Configure and manage automatic scaling - Define scaling  policies  to
         dynamically  scale  your  resources in response to CloudWatch alarms,
         schedule one-time or recurring scaling  actions,  and  retrieve  your
         recent scaling activity history.

       o Suspend  and  resume  scaling  - Temporarily suspend and later resume
         automatic scaling by calling the  RegisterScalableTarget  API  action
         for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and
         resume (individually or in combination) scale-out activities that are
         triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities that are triggered
         by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.

       about  granting  IAM  users  required  permissions for Application Auto
       Scaling actions, see the Application Auto Scaling User Guide .
