SYNOPSIS
            start-attachment-upload
          --content-type <value>
          --attachment-size-in-bytes <value>
          --attachment-name <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          --connection-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --content-type (string)
          Describes  the  MIME file type of the attachment. For a list of sup-
          ported file types, see Feature specifications in the Amazon  Connect
          Administrator Guide .

       --attachment-size-in-bytes (long)
          The size of the attachment in bytes.

       --attachment-name (string)
          A case-sensitive name of the attachment being uploaded.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  case  sensitive  identifier  to  support  idempotency  of
          request.

       --connection-token (string)
          The authentication token associated with the  participant's  connec-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
