DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Signer  is a fully managed code signing service to help you ensure
       the trust and integrity of your code.

       AWS Signer supports the following applications:

       With code signing for AWS Lambda , you can sign AWS  Lambda  deployment
       packages.  Integrated  support is provided for Amazon S3, Amazon Cloud-
       Watch, and AWS CloudTrail. In order to sign code, you create a  signing
       profile and then use Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3.

       With  code  signing for IoT , you can sign code for any IoT device that
       is supported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for Amazon  FreeRTOS
       and  AWS IoT Device Management , and is integrated with AWS Certificate
       Manager (ACM) . In order to sign code, you import  a  third-party  code
       signing  certificate  using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon
       FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management.
