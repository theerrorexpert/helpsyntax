CREATE-IP-GROUP()                                            CREATE-IP-GROUP()



NAME
       create-ip-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an IP access control group.

       An IP access control group provides you with the ability to control the
       IP addresses from which users are allowed to access  their  WorkSpaces.
       To specify the CIDR address ranges, add rules to your IP access control
       group and then associate the group with your  directory.  You  can  add
       rules  when you create the group or at any time using  AuthorizeIpRules
       .

       There is a default IP access control group associated with your  direc-
       tory.  If  you  don't  associate  an  IP access control group with your
       directory, the default group is used.  The  default  group  includes  a
       default  rule  that  allows  users to access their WorkSpaces from any-
       where. You cannot modify the default IP access control group  for  your
       directory.

          --group-name <value>
          [--group-desc <value>]
          [--user-rules <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group.

       --group-desc (string)
          The description of the group.

       --user-rules (list)
          The rules to add to the group.

          (structure)
              Describes a rule for an IP access control group.

              ipRule -> (string)
                 The IP address range, in CIDR notation.

              ruleDesc -> (string)
                 The description.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ipRule=string,ruleDesc=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ipRule": "string",
              "ruleDesc": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          The tags. Each WorkSpaces resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GroupId -> (string)
          The identifier of the group.
