DEREGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()              DEREGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()



NAME
       deregister-workspace-directory -

DESCRIPTION
       Deregisters the specified directory. This operation is asynchronous and
       returns  before  the  WorkSpace  directory  is  deregistered.  If   any
       WorkSpaces  are  registered  to  this  directory,  you must remove them
       before you can deregister the directory.

       NOTE:
          Simple AD and AD Connector are made available to you free of  charge
          to  use  with WorkSpaces. If there are no WorkSpaces being used with
          your Simple AD or AD Connector directory for  30  consecutive  days,
          this  directory will be automatically deregistered for use with Ama-
          zon WorkSpaces, and you will be charged for this  directory  as  per
          the Directory Service pricing terms .

          To  delete  empty  directories,  see  Delete  the Directory for Your
          WorkSpaces . If you delete your Simple AD or AD Connector directory,
          you  can  always  create  a  new  one  when  you want to start using
          WorkSpaces again.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-workspace-directory
          --directory-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory. If any WorkSpaces are registered to
          this  directory,  you  must  remove  them  before you deregister the
          directory, or you  will  receive  an  OperationNotSupportedException
          error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
