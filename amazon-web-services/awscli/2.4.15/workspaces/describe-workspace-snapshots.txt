NAME
       describe-workspace-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the snapshots for the specified WorkSpace.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-workspace-snapshots
          --workspace-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workspace-id (string)
          The identifier of the WorkSpace.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RebuildSnapshots -> (list)
          Information  about  the  snapshots  that  can  be  used to rebuild a
          WorkSpace. These snapshots include the user volume.

          (structure)
              Describes a snapshot.

              SnapshotTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the snapshot was created.

       RestoreSnapshots -> (list)
          Information about the snapshots  that  can  be  used  to  restore  a
          WorkSpace. These snapshots include both the root volume and the user
          volume.
