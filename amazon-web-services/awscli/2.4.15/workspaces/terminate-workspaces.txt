TERMINATE-WORKSPACES()                                  TERMINATE-WORKSPACES()



NAME
       terminate-workspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Terminates the specified WorkSpaces.

       WARNING:
          Terminating  a WorkSpace is a permanent action and cannot be undone.
          The user's data is destroyed. If you need to archive any user  data,
          contact   Amazon   Web   Services  Support  before  terminating  the
          WorkSpace.

       You can terminate a WorkSpace that is in any state except SUSPENDED .

       This operation is asynchronous and returns before the  WorkSpaces  have
       been completely terminated. After a WorkSpace is terminated, the TERMI-
       NATED state is returned only briefly  before  the  WorkSpace  directory
       metadata  is  cleaned  up, so this state is rarely returned. To confirm
       that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for the  WorkSpace  ID  by  using
       DescribeWorkSpaces  .  If  the  WorkSpace  ID  isn't returned, then the
       WorkSpace has been successfully terminated.

       NOTE:
          Simple AD and AD Connector are made available to you free of  charge
          to  use  with WorkSpaces. If there are no WorkSpaces being used with
          your Simple AD or AD Connector directory for  30  consecutive  days,
          this  directory will be automatically deregistered for use with Ama-
          zon WorkSpaces, and you will be charged for this  directory  as  per
          the Directory Service pricing terms .

          To  delete  empty  directories,  see  Delete  the Directory for Your
          WorkSpaces . If you delete your Simple AD or AD Connector directory,
          you  can  always  create  a  new  one  when  you want to start using
          WorkSpaces again.

SYNOPSIS
            terminate-workspaces
          --terminate-workspace-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --terminate-workspace-requests (list)
          The WorkSpaces to terminate. You can specify up to 25 WorkSpaces.

          (structure)
              Describes the information used to terminate a WorkSpace.

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          --terminate-workspace-requests WorkspaceId1 WorkspaceId2 WorkspaceId3

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "WorkspaceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To terminate a WorkSpace

       This example terminates the specified WorkSpace.

       Command:

          aws workspaces terminate-workspaces --terminate-workspace-requests wsb-3t36q0xfc

       Output:

          {
            "FailedRequests": []
          }

OUTPUT
       FailedRequests -> (list)
          Information about the WorkSpaces that could not be terminated.

          (structure)
              Describes a WorkSpace that could  not  be  rebooted.  (  Reboot-
              Workspaces ), rebuilt ( RebuildWorkspaces ), restored ( Restore-
              Workspace ),  terminated  (  TerminateWorkspaces  ),  started  (
              StartWorkspaces ), or stopped ( StopWorkspaces ).

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  error  code  that is returned if the WorkSpace cannot be
                 rebooted.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The text of  the  error  message  that  is  returned  if  the
                 WorkSpace cannot be rebooted.
