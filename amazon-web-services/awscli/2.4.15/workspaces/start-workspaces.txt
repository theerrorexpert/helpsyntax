NAME
       start-workspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the specified WorkSpaces.

       You  cannot  start a WorkSpace unless it has a running mode of AutoStop
       and a state of STOPPED .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-workspaces
          --start-workspace-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-workspace-requests (list)
          The WorkSpaces to start. You can specify up to 25 WorkSpaces.

          (structure)
              Information used to start a WorkSpace.

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          WorkspaceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "WorkspaceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedRequests -> (list)
          Information about the WorkSpaces that could not be started.

          (structure)
              Describes a WorkSpace that could  not  be  rebooted.  (  Reboot-
              Workspaces ), rebuilt ( RebuildWorkspaces ), restored ( Restore-
              Workspace ),  terminated  (  TerminateWorkspaces  ),  started  (
              StartWorkspaces ), or stopped ( StopWorkspaces ).

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  error  code  that is returned if the WorkSpace cannot be
                 rebooted.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The text of  the  error  message  that  is  returned  if  the
                 WorkSpace cannot be rebooted.
