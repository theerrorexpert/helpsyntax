DESCRIBE-WORKSPACES()                                    DESCRIBE-WORKSPACES()



NAME
       describe-workspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified WorkSpaces.

       You  can  filter  the results by using the bundle identifier, directory
       identifier, or owner, but you can specify only one filter at a time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-workspaces is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Workspaces

SYNOPSIS
            describe-workspaces
          [--workspace-ids <value>]
          [--directory-id <value>]
          [--user-name <value>]
          [--bundle-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workspace-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the WorkSpaces. You cannot combine this parameter
          with any other filter.

          Because the  CreateWorkspaces operation is asynchronous, the identi-
          fier  it  returns  is  not immediately available. If you immediately
          call  DescribeWorkspaces with this  identifier,  no  information  is
          returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --directory-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  directory. In addition, you can optionally
          specify a specific directory user (see UserName ). You  cannot  com-
          bine this parameter with any other filter.

       --user-name (string)
          The name of the directory user. You must specify this parameter with
          DirectoryId .

       --bundle-id (string)
          The identifier of the bundle. All WorkSpaces that are  created  from
          this  bundle  are  retrieved. You cannot combine this parameter with
          any other filter.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Workspaces -> (list)
          Information about the WorkSpaces.

          Because   CreateWorkspaces is an asynchronous operation, some of the
          returned information could be incomplete.

          (structure)
              Describes a WorkSpace.

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Directory  Service  directory  for  the
                 WorkSpace.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The user for the WorkSpace.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address of the WorkSpace.

              State -> (string)
                 The operational state of the WorkSpace.

                 NOTE:
                     After  a WorkSpace is terminated, the TERMINATED state is
                     returned only  briefly  before  the  WorkSpace  directory
                     metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned.
                     To confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for  the
                     WorkSpace   ID  by  using  DescribeWorkSpaces  .  If  the
                     WorkSpace ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has  been
                     successfully terminated.

              BundleId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the bundle used to create the WorkSpace.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the subnet for the WorkSpace.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The  text  of  the  error  message  that  is  returned if the
                 WorkSpace cannot be created.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code that is returned if the  WorkSpace  cannot  be
                 created.

              ComputerName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the WorkSpace, as seen by the operating system.
                 The format of this name varies.  For  more  information,  see
                 Launch a WorkSpace .

              VolumeEncryptionKey -> (string)
                 The  symmetric  KMS  key  used to encrypt data stored on your
                 WorkSpace. Amazon WorkSpaces does not support asymmetric  KMS
                 keys.

              UserVolumeEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  data  stored  on  the user volume is
                 encrypted.

              RootVolumeEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the data  stored  on  the  root  volume  is
                 encrypted.

              WorkspaceProperties -> (structure)
                 The properties of the WorkSpace.

                 RunningMode -> (string)
                     The  running  mode.  For more information, see Manage the
                     WorkSpace Running Mode .

                 RunningModeAutoStopTimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The time after a user logs off when WorkSpaces are  auto-
                     matically stopped. Configured in 60-minute intervals.

                 RootVolumeSizeGib -> (integer)
                     The  size  of  the root volume. For important information
