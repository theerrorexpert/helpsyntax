NAME
       describe-workspace-directories -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  available  directories  that are registered with Amazon
       WorkSpaces.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-workspace-directories is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Directories

SYNOPSIS
            describe-workspace-directories
          [--directory-ids <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the directories. If the value is null, all direc-
          tories are retrieved.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of directories to return.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Directories -> (list)
          Information about the directories.

          (structure)
              Describes a directory that is used with Amazon WorkSpaces.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The directory identifier.

              Alias -> (string)
                 The directory alias.

              DirectoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the directory.

              RegistrationCode -> (string)
                 The registration code for the directory.  This  is  the  code
                 that  users  enter in their Amazon WorkSpaces client applica-
                 tion to connect to the directory.

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 The identifiers of the subnets used with the directory.

                 (string)

              DnsIpAddresses -> (list)
                 The IP addresses of the DNS servers for the directory.

                 (string)

              CustomerUserName -> (string)
                 The user name for the service account.

              IamRoleId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the IAM role. This is the role that  allows
                 Amazon  WorkSpaces  to  make calls to other services, such as
                 Amazon EC2, on your behalf.

              DirectoryType -> (string)
                 The directory type.

              WorkspaceSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the security group that is assigned to  new
                 WorkSpaces.

              State -> (string)
                 The   state  of  the  directory's  registration  with  Amazon
                 WorkSpaces. After a directory is deregistered,  the  DEREGIS-
                 TERED  state  is  returned  very briefly before the directory
                 metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned.  To
                 confirm  that  a  directory  is  deregistered,  check for the
                 directory ID by using DescribeWorkspaceDirectories .  If  the
                 directory ID isn't returned, then the directory has been suc-
                 cessfully deregistered.

              WorkspaceCreationProperties -> (structure)
                 The default creation properties for  all  WorkSpaces  in  the
                 directory.

                 EnableWorkDocs -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the  directory  is enabled for Amazon
                     WorkDocs.

                 EnableInternetAccess -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether to automatically assign an Elastic pub-
                     lic  IP  address  to  WorkSpaces  in  this  directory  by
                     default. If enabled, the Elastic public IP address allows
                     outbound  internet access from your WorkSpaces when youre
                     using an internet gateway in the Amazon VPC in which your
                     WorkSpaces are located. If you're using a Network Address
                     Translation (NAT) gateway for  outbound  internet  access
                     from  your  VPC, or if your WorkSpaces are in public sub-
                     nets and you manually assign them Elastic  IP  addresses,
                     you  should disable this setting. This setting applies to
                     new WorkSpaces that you launch or to existing  WorkSpaces
                     that  you  rebuild. For more information, see Configure a
                     VPC for Amazon WorkSpaces .

                 DefaultOu -> (string)
                     The organizational unit (OU) in  the  directory  for  the
                     WorkSpace machine accounts.

                 CustomSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                     The  identifier of the default security group to apply to
                     WorkSpaces when they are created. For  more  information,
                     see Security Groups for Your WorkSpaces .

                 UserEnabledAsLocalAdministrator -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  WorkSpace users are local administra-
                     tors on their WorkSpaces.

                 EnableMaintenanceMode -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  maintenance  mode  is   enabled   for
                     WorkSpaces.  For  more information, see WorkSpace Mainte-
                     nance .

              ipGroupIds -> (list)
                 The identifiers of the IP access  control  groups  associated
                 with the directory.
