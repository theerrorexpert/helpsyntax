LIST-AVAILABLE-MANAGEMENT-CIDR-RANGES()LIST-AVAILABLE-MANAGEMENT-CIDR-RANGES()



NAME
       list-available-management-cidr-ranges -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list of IP address ranges, specified as IPv4 CIDR blocks,
       that you can use for the network management interface when  you  enable
       Bring Your Own License (BYOL).

       This operation can be run only by Amazon Web Services accounts that are
       enabled for BYOL. If  your  account  isn't  enabled  for  BYOL,  you'll
       receive an AccessDeniedException error.

       The  management  network  interface  is  connected  to  a secure Amazon
       WorkSpaces management network. It is used for interactive streaming  of
       the WorkSpace desktop to Amazon WorkSpaces clients, and to allow Amazon
       WorkSpaces to manage the WorkSpace.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-available-management-cidr-ranges is a paginated operation.  Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ManagementCidrRanges

SYNOPSIS
            list-available-management-cidr-ranges
          --management-cidr-range-constraint <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --management-cidr-range-constraint (string)
          The  IP address range to search. Specify an IP address range that is
          compatible with your network and in CIDR notation (that is,  specify
          the range as an IPv4 CIDR block).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ManagementCidrRanges -> (list)
          The list of available IP address  ranges,  specified  as  IPv4  CIDR
          blocks.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
