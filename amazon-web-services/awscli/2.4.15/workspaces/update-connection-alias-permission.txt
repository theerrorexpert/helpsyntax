NAME
       update-connection-alias-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Shares  or  unshares  a connection alias with one account by specifying
       whether that account has permission to associate the  connection  alias
       with a directory. If the association permission is granted, the connec-
       tion alias is shared with that account. If the  association  permission
       is revoked, the connection alias is unshared with the account. For more
       information, see Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces .

       NOTE:

          o Before performing this operation,  call  DescribeConnectionAliases
            to  make  sure  that  the current state of the connection alias is
            CREATED .

          o To delete a connection alias that  has  been  shared,  the  shared
            account  must  first  disassociate  the  connection alias from any
            directories it has been associated with. Then you must unshare the
            connection alias from the account it has been shared with. You can
            delete a connection alias only after it is no longer  shared  with
            any accounts or associated with any directories.

SYNOPSIS
            update-connection-alias-permission
          --alias-id <value>
          --connection-alias-permission <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alias-id (string)
          The  identifier of the connection alias that you want to update per-
          missions for.

       --connection-alias-permission (structure)
          Indicates whether to share or unshare the connection alias with  the
          specified Amazon Web Services account.

          SharedAccountId -> (string)
              The  identifier of the Amazon Web Services account that the con-
              nection alias is shared with.

          AllowAssociation -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the specified Amazon Web Services  account  is
              allowed to associate the connection alias with a directory.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SharedAccountId=string,AllowAssociation=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SharedAccountId": "string",
            "AllowAssociation": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
