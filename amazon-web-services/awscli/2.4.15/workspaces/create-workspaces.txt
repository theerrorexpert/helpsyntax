            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Because  this  operation is asynchronous, the identifier returned is
          not immediately available for use with other operations.  For  exam-
          ple,  if  you  call  DescribeWorkspaces before the WorkSpace is cre-
          ated, the information returned can be incomplete.

          (structure)
              Describes a WorkSpace.

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Directory  Service  directory  for  the
                 WorkSpace.

              State -> (string)
                 The operational state of the WorkSpace.

                 NOTE:
                     After  a WorkSpace is terminated, the TERMINATED state is
                     returned only  briefly  before  the  WorkSpace  directory
                     metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned.
                     To confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for  the
                     WorkSpace   ID  by  using  DescribeWorkSpaces  .  If  the
                     WorkSpace ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has  been
                     successfully terminated.

                 The  name  of the WorkSpace, as seen by the operating system.
                 The format of this name varies.  For  more  information,  see
