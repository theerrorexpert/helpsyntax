REGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()                  REGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()



NAME
       register-workspace-directory -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  the  specified directory. This operation is asynchronous and
       returns before the WorkSpace directory is registered. If  this  is  the
       first time you are registering a directory, you will need to create the
       workspaces_DefaultRole role before you can register  a  directory.  For
       more information, see Creating the workspaces_DefaultRole Role .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-workspace-directory
          --directory-id <value>
          [--subnet-ids <value>]
          --enable-work-docs | --no-enable-work-docs
          [--enable-self-service | --no-enable-self-service]
          [--tenancy <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The  identifier of the directory. You cannot register a directory if
          it does not have a status of Active. If the directory does not  have
          a  status  of Active, you will receive an InvalidResourceStateExcep-
          tion error. If you have already registered  the  maximum  number  of
          directories  that  you can register with Amazon WorkSpaces, you will
          receive a ResourceLimitExceededException error. Deregister  directo-
          ries that you are not using for WorkSpaces, and try again.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the subnets for your virtual private cloud (VPC).
          Make sure that the subnets are in supported Availability Zones.  The
          subnets must also be in separate Availability Zones. If these condi-
          tions are not met, you will receive  an  OperationNotSupportedExcep-
          tion error.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enable-work-docs | --no-enable-work-docs (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  Amazon  WorkDocs  is enabled or disabled. If you
          have enabled this parameter and WorkDocs is  not  available  in  the
          Region,  you  will  receive an OperationNotSupportedException error.
          Set EnableWorkDocs to disabled, and try again.

       --enable-self-service | --no-enable-self-service (boolean)
          Indicates whether self-service capabilities are enabled or disabled.

       --tenancy (string)
          Indicates  whether  your WorkSpace directory is dedicated or shared.
          To use Bring Your Own License (BYOL) images, this value must be  set
          to  DEDICATED  and  your Amazon Web Services account must be enabled
          for BYOL. If your account has not been enabled for  BYOL,  you  will
          receive  an InvalidParameterValuesException error. For more informa-
          tion about BYOL images, see Bring Your Own Windows Desktop Images  .

          Possible values:

          o DEDICATED

          o SHARED

       --tags (list)
          The tags associated with the directory.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
