DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Single  Sign-On  (SSO) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that
       enables a client (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to  register
       with  AWS  SSO.  The service also enables the client to fetch the users
       access token upon successful authentication and authorization with  AWS
       SSO.  This  service conforms with the OAuth 2.0 based implementation of
       the      device       authorization       grant       standard       (-
       https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628 ).

       For  general information about AWS SSO, see What is AWS Single Sign-On?
       in the AWS SSO User Guide .

       This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO OIDC operations that you
       can  call  programatically  and  includes  detailed information on data
       types and errors.

       NOTE:
          AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for var-
          ious  programming  languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .Net,
          iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to  create  pro-
          grammatic  access to AWS SSO and other AWS services. For more infor-
          mation about the AWS SDKs, including how  to  download  and  install
          them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services .
