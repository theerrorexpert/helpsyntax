UPDATE-CLUSTER()                                              UPDATE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       update-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       While  a  cluster's  ClusterState value is in the AwaitingQuorum state,
       you can update some of the information associated with a cluster.  Once
       the  cluster changes to a different job state, usually 60 minutes after
       the cluster being created, this action is no longer available.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 Machine Image (AMI), including the Amazon EC2 AMI ID and  the
                 Snow  device  AMI  ID. Each AMI has these two IDs to simplify
                 identifying the AMI in both the Amazon Web Services Cloud and
                 on the device.

                 AmiId -> (string)

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the

       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not

       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
