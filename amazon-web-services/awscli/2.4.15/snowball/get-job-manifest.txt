GET-JOB-MANIFEST()                                          GET-JOB-MANIFEST()



NAME
       get-job-manifest -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  link  to  an  Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file
       associated with the specified JobId value. You can access the  manifest
       file  for  up to 60 minutes after this request has been made. To access
       the manifest file after 60 minutes have passed,  you'll  have  to  make
       another call to the GetJobManifest action.

       The  manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job
       enters the WithCustomer status. The manifest is decrypted by using  the
       UnlockCode  code  value,  when  you pass both values to the Snow device
       through the Snowball client when the client is started  for  the  first
       time.

       As  a  best  practice,  we  recommend  that you don't save a copy of an
       UnlockCode value in the same location as the  manifest  file  for  that
       job.  Saving  these  separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from
       gaining access to the Snow device associated with that job.

       The credentials of a given job, including its manifest file and  unlock
       code, expire 360 days after the job is created.

SYNOPSIS
            get-job-manifest
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  ID  for  a  job that you want to get the manifest file for, for
          example JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ManifestURI -> (string)
          The Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest  file  associated  with
          the specified JobId value.
