DESCRIBE-ADDRESSES()                                      DESCRIBE-ADDRESSES()



NAME
       describe-addresses -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a specified number of ADDRESS objects. Calling this API in one
       of the US regions will return addresses from the list of all  addresses
       associated with this account in all US regions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-addresses  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Addresses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-addresses
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Addresses -> (list)
          The  Snow  device  shipping  addresses  that  were  created for this

              the serviceable area of your region. Although no individual ele-
              ments of the Address are required, if the address is invalid  or

              Name -> (string)

              Company -> (string)
                 The name of the company  to  receive  a  Snow  device  at  an

              Street3 -> (string)
                 The  third  line in a street address that a Snow device is to
                 be delivered to.

              City -> (string)
                 The city in an address that a Snow device is to be  delivered
                 to.

              StateOrProvince -> (string)
                 The  state or province in an address that a Snow device is to
                 be delivered to.

              PrefectureOrDistrict -> (string)
                 This field is no longer used and the value is ignored.

              Country -> (string)
                 The country in an address that a Snow device is to be  deliv-
                 ered to.

              PostalCode -> (string)

              PhoneNumber -> (string)
                 The phone number associated  with  an  address  that  a  Snow
                 device is to be delivered to.

              IsRestricted -> (boolean)
                 If  the  address  you are creating is a primary address, then
                 set this option to true. This field is not supported in  most
                 regions.

       NextToken -> (string)
          HTTP  requests are stateless. If you use the automatically generated
          NextToken value in your next DescribeAddresses call,  your  list  of
          returned addresses will start from this point in the array.
