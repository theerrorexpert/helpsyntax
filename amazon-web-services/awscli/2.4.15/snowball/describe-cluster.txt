DESCRIBE-CLUSTER()                                          DESCRIBE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       describe-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about a specific cluster including shipping infor-
       mation, cluster status, and other important metadata.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster
          --cluster-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The automatically generated ID for a cluster.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              o In Australia, you have access to express shipping.  Typically,
                devices shipped express are delivered in about a day.

              o In  the  European Union (EU), you have access to express ship-
                ping. Typically, Snow devices shipped express are delivered in
                about a day. In addition, most countries in the EU have access
                to standard shipping, which typically takes less than a  week,
                one way.

              o In India, Snow devices are delivered in one to seven days.

              o In  the  US,  you  have access to one-day shipping and two-day
                shipping.

                 through the Amazon Web Services  Management  Console,  or  by
                 using  the Subscribe Amazon Simple Notification Service (Ama-
