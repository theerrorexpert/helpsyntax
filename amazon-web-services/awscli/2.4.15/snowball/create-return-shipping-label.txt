       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-return-shipping-label
          --job-id <value>
          [--shipping-option <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID for a job that you want to create the return  shipping  label
          for; for example, JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

       --shipping-option (string)
          The  shipping speed for a particular job. This speed doesn't dictate
          how soon the device is returned to Amazon Web Services.  This  speed
          represents how quickly it moves to its destination while in transit.
          Regional shipping speeds are as follows:

          Possible values:

          o SECOND_DAY

          o NEXT_DAY

          o EXPRESS

          o STANDARD

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The status information of the task on a Snow device  that  is  being
          returned to Amazon Web Services.
