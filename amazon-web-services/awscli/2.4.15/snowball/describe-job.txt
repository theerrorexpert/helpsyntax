DESCRIBE-JOB()                                                  DESCRIBE-JOB()



NAME
       describe-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  a specific job including shipping informa-
       tion, job status, and other important metadata.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  automatically   generated   ID   for   a   job,   for   example
          JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                   a day.

                 o In the European Union (EU),  you  have  access  to  express
                   shipping.  Typically,  Snow  devices  shipped  express  are
                   delivered in about a day. In addition,  most  countries  in
                   the  EU  have  access to standard shipping, which typically
                   takes less than a week, one way.

                 o In India, Snow devices are delivered in one to seven  days.

                       ically, Snow devices shipped express are  delivered  in
                       about a day.

                     o In  the European Union (EU), you have access to express
                       shipping. Typically, Snow devices shipped  express  are
                       delivered  in  about a day. In addition, most countries
                       in the EU have access to standard shipping, which typi-
                       cally takes less than a week, one way.

                     o In  India,  Snow  devices are delivered in one to seven
                       days.

                     o In the United States of America (US), you  have  access
