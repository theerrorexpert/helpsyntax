GET-JOB-UNLOCK-CODE()                                    GET-JOB-UNLOCK-CODE()



NAME
       get-job-unlock-code -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  UnlockCode code value for the specified job. A particular
       UnlockCode value can be accessed for up to 360 days after  the  associ-
       ated job has been created.

       The  UnlockCode value is a 29-character code with 25 alphanumeric char-
       acters and 4 hyphens. This code is used to decrypt  the  manifest  file
       when  it  is  passed along with the manifest to the Snow device through
       the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time.

       As a best practice, we recommend that you don't  save  a  copy  of  the
       UnlockCode in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Sav-
       ing these separately helps prevent unauthorized  parties  from  gaining
       access to the Snow device associated with that job.

SYNOPSIS
            get-job-unlock-code
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  ID  for  the job that you want to get the UnlockCode value for,
          for example JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UnlockCode -> (string)
          The UnlockCode value for the specified job. The UnlockCode value can
          be accessed for up to 360 days after the job has been created.
