CREATE-CLUSTER()                                              CREATE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an empty cluster. Each cluster supports five nodes. You use the
       CreateJob action separately to create the jobs for each of these nodes.
       The cluster does not ship until these five node jobs have been created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 identifying the AMI in both the Amazon Web Services Cloud and

          to use the Snowball Client to manage the device.

          Possible values:

          o INSTALLED_AUTOSTART

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ClusterId -> (string)
          The automatically generated ID for a cluster.
