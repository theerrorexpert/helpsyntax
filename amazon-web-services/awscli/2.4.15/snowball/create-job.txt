CREATE-JOB()                                                      CREATE-JOB()



NAME
       create-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  job  to  import  or  export data between Amazon S3 and your
       on-premises data center. Your Amazon Web Services account must have the
       right  trust  policies  and  permissions in place to create a job for a
       Snow device. If you're creating a job for a node in a cluster, you only
       need  to  provide  the  clusterId  value;  the other job attributes are
       inherited from the cluster.

       NOTE:
              Only the Snowball; Edge device type is supported  when  ordering
              clustered jobs.

              The device capacity is optional.

              Availability  of  device  types  differ  by  Amazon Web Services
              Region. For more  information  about  Region  availability,  see
              Amazon Web Services Regional Services .

          With IMPORT jobs, you specify the bucket or buckets that your trans-
          ferred data will be imported into.

          With EXPORT jobs, you specify the bucket or buckets that your trans-
          ferred data will be exported from. Optionally, you can also  specify
          a  KeyRange  value.  If you choose to export a range, you define the
          length of the range by providing  either  an  inclusive  BeginMarker
          value,  an  inclusive  EndMarker  value,  or  both. Ranges are UTF-8
          binary sorted.

                 For export jobs, this object can have  an  optional  KeyRange
                 value.  The  length  of the range is defined at job creation,
                 and has either an inclusive BeginMarker , an  inclusive  End-

       JSON Syntax:

          {

              "WirelessConnection": {
                "IsWifiEnabled": true|false

       --remote-management (string)
          Allows  you to securely operate and manage Snowcone devices remotely
          from   outside   of   your   internal   network.   When    set    to
          INSTALLED_AUTOSTART , remote management will automatically be avail-
          able when the device arrives at your location. Otherwise,  you  need
          to use the Snowball Client to manage the device.

          Possible values:

          o INSTALLED_ONLY

          o INSTALLED_AUTOSTART

       --long-term-pricing-id (string)
          The ID of the long-term pricing type for the device.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
