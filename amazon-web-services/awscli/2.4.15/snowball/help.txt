DESCRIPTION
       The  Amazon  Web  Services  Snow  Family provides a petabyte-scale data
       transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer  large  amounts
       of data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage
       Service (Amazon S3). The Snow Family commands  described  here  provide
       access  to  the  same functionality that is available in the Amazon Web
       Services Snow Family Management Console, which enables  you  to  create
       and manage jobs for a Snow Family device. To transfer data locally with
       a Snow Family device, you'll need to use the Snowball  Edge  client  or
       the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or OpsHub for Snow Family. For
       more information, see the User Guide .
