DESCRIBE-TUNNEL()                                            DESCRIBE-TUNNEL()



NAME
       describe-tunnel -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a tunnel identified by the unique tunnel id.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-tunnel
          --tunnel-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --tunnel-id (string)
          The tunnel to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       tunnel -> (structure)
          The tunnel being described.

          tunnelId -> (string)
              A unique alpha-numeric ID that identifies a tunnel.

          tunnelArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a tunnel. The tunnel ARN for-
              mat is arn:aws:tunnel:<region>:<account-id>:tunnel/<tunnel-id>

          status -> (string)
              The status of a tunnel. Valid values are: Open and Closed.

          sourceConnectionState -> (structure)
              The connection state of the source application.

              status -> (string)
                 The connection status of the tunnel. Valid  values  are  CON-
                 NECTED and DISCONNECTED .

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the connection status was updated.

          destinationConnectionState -> (structure)
              The connection state of the destination application.

              status -> (string)
                 The  connection  status  of the tunnel. Valid values are CON-
                 NECTED and DISCONNECTED .

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the connection status was updated.

          description -> (string)
              A description of the tunnel.

          destinationConfig -> (structure)
              The destination configuration that specifies the thing  name  of
              the  destination  device and a service name that the local proxy
              uses to connect to the destination application.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing to which you want to connect.

              services -> (list)
                 A list of service names that identity the target application.
                 The  AWS  IoT  client running on the destination device reads
                 this value and uses it to look up a port or an IP address and
                 a port. The AWS IoT client instantiates the local proxy which
                 uses this information to connect to the destination  applica-
                 tion.

                 (string)

          timeoutConfig -> (structure)
              Timeout configuration for the tunnel.

              maxLifetimeTimeoutMinutes -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  amount of time (in minutes) a tunnel can remain
                 open. If not specified, maxLifetimeTimeoutMinutes defaults to
                 720  minutes. Valid values are from 1 minute to 12 hours (720
                 minutes)

          tags -> (list)
              A list of tag metadata associated with the secure tunnel.

              (structure)
                 An arbitary key/value pair used to add searchable metadata to
                 secure tunnel resources.

                 key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the tunnel was created.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The last time the tunnel was updated.
