NAME
       list-packaging-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns   a   collection  of  MediaPackage  VOD  PackagingConfiguration
       resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-packaging-configurations is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: PackagingConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            list-packaging-configurations
          [--packaging-group-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --packaging-group-id (string) Returns MediaPackage VOD PackagingConfig-
       urations associated with the specified PackagingGroup.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all packaging configurations

       The  following  list-packaging-configurations  example lists all of the
       packaging configurations that are configured  on  the  packaging  group
       named Packaging_group_1.

                        a 32-character string, used in  conjunction  with  the
                        key  for  encrypting  blocks.  If  you don't specify a
                        value, then MediaPackage creates the constant initial-
                        ization vector (IV).

                        will provide encryption keys.

                        RoleArn -> (string)

                        AdMarkers -> (string)
                            This  setting controls how ad markers are included
                            in the packaged OriginEndpoint. "NONE"  will  omit
                            all   SCTE-35   ad   markers   from   the  output.
                            "PASSTHROUGH" causes the  manifest  to  contain  a
                            copy  of  the  SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken
                            directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming  (HLS)
                            manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                            and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the
                            input source.

                        IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                            When  enabled,  an  I-Frame  only  stream  will be
                            included in the output.

                        ManifestName -> (string)
                            An optional string to include in the name  of  the
                            manifest.

                        ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                            The  interval (in seconds) between each EXT-X-PRO-
                            GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests.  Addi-
                            tionally,  when  an interval is specified ID3Timed
                            Metadata messages will be generated every  5  sec-
                            onds  using the ingest time of the content. If the
                            interval is not specified, or set to  0,  then  no
                            EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into
                            manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata  messages  will
                            be  generated.  Note  that  irrespective  of  this
                            parameter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata is  found  in
                            HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed
                            through to HLS output.

                        RepeatExtXKey -> (boolean)
                            When enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will  be  repeated
                            in output manifests.

                        StreamSelection -> (structure)
                            A StreamSelection configuration.

                            MaxVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                               The  maximum  video bitrate (bps) to include in
                               output.

                            MinVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                               The minimum video bitrate (bps) to  include  in
                               output.

                            StreamOrder -> (string)
                               A   directive  that  determines  the  order  of
                               streams in the output.

                 IncludeEncoderConfigurationInSegments -> (boolean)
                     When  includeEncoderConfigurationInSegments  is  set   to
                     true, MediaPackage places your encoder's Sequence Parame-
                     ter Set (SPS), Picture Parameter  Set  (PPS),  and  Video
                     Parameter  Set  (VPS)  metadata  in  every  video segment
                     instead of in the init fragment. This lets you  use  dif-
                     ferent  SPS/PPS/VPS  settings for your assets during con-
                     tent playback.

                 SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual  fragments
                     will  be  rounded  to  the nearest multiple of the source
                     fragment duration.

              DashPackage -> (structure)
                 A Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) packaging  con-
                 figuration.

                 DashManifests -> (list)
                     A list of DASH manifest configurations.

                     (structure)
                        A DASH manifest configuration.

                        ManifestLayout -> (string)
                            Determines  the position of some tags in the Media
                            Presentation Description (MPD). When set to  FULL,
                            elements  like  SegmentTemplate and ContentProtec-
                            tion are included in each Representation. When set
