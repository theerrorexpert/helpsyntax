NAME
       describe-packaging-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  description  of  a  MediaPackage VOD PackagingConfiguration
       resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-packaging-configuration
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string) The  ID  of  a  MediaPackage  VOD  PackagingConfiguration
       resource.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the PackagingConfiguration.

       CmafPackage -> (structure)
          A CMAF packaging configuration.

          Encryption -> (structure)
              A CMAF encryption configuration.

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 An  optional  128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value  represented by a
                 32-character string, used in conjunction  with  the  key  for
                 encrypting  blocks. If you don't specify a value, then Media-
                 Package creates the constant initialization vector (IV).

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and
                 Encoder  Key  Exchange  (SPEKE)  service  that  will  provide
                 encryption keys.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an  IAM  role  that  AWS
                     Elemental MediaPackage will assume when accessing the key
                     provider service.

                 SystemIds -> (list)
                     The system IDs to include in key requests.

                     (string)

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the external key provider service.

          HlsManifests -> (list)
              A list of HLS manifest configurations.

              (structure)
                 An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 AdMarkers -> (string)
                     This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the
                     packaged  OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35 ad
                     markers from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes  the  mani-
                     fest  to  contain  a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (com-
                     ments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live  Streaming
                     (HLS)  manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                     and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the  input
                     source.

                 IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in
                     the output.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An optional string to include in the name  of  the  mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The   interval   (in  seconds)  between  each  EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when  an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated every 5 seconds using the  ingest  time
                     of  the content. If the interval is not specified, or set
                     to  0,  then  no  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  tags  will  be
                     inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter,  if  any  ID3  Timed  Metadata is found in HTTP Live
                     Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through  to  HLS
                     output.

                 RepeatExtXKey -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in out-
                     put manifests.

              during content playback.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be

                        The  minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.

                     StreamOrder -> (string)
                        A directive that determines the order  of  streams  in
