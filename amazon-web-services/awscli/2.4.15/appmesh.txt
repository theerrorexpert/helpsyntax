NAME
       appmesh -

DESCRIPTION
       App  Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy
       to monitor and control microservices. App Mesh  standardizes  how  your
       microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping
       to ensure high availability for your applications.

       App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network  traffic  controls
       for  every  microservice  in  an application. You can use App Mesh with
       Amazon Web Services Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes on Ama-
       zon Web Services, and Amazon EC2.

       NOTE:
          App Mesh supports microservice applications that use service discov-
          ery naming for their components. For more information about  service
          discovery on Amazon ECS, see Service Discovery in the Amazon Elastic
          Container Service Developer Guide . Kubernetes kube-dns and  coredns
          are  supported.  For more information, see DNS for Services and Pods
          in the Kubernetes documentation.
