DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-REFRESHES()                    DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-REFRESHES()



NAME
       describe-instance-refreshes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  the instance refreshes for the specified Auto
       Scaling group.

       This operation is part of the instance refresh feature  in  Amazon  EC2
       Auto  Scaling,  which  helps  you update instances in your Auto Scaling
       group after you make configuration changes.

       To help you determine the status of an instance refresh, this operation
       returns  information about the instance refreshes you previously initi-
       ated, including their status, end time, the percentage of the  instance
       refresh  that  is  complete,  and  the number of instances remaining to
       update before the instance refresh is complete.

       The following are the possible statuses:

       o Pending - The request was created, but the operation has not started.

       o InProgress - The operation is in progress.

       o Successful - The operation completed successfully.

       o Failed - The operation failed to complete. You can troubleshoot using
         the status reason and the scaling activities.

       o Cancelling - An ongoing operation is  being  cancelled.  Cancellation
         does not roll back any replacements that have already been completed,
         but it prevents new replacements from being started.

       o Cancelled - The operation is cancelled.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-refreshes
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--instance-refresh-ids <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --instance-refresh-ids (list)
          One or more instance refresh IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return.  (You  received  this
          token from a previous call.)

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of items to return with this call. The default
          value is 50 and the maximum value is 100 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InstanceRefreshes -> (list)
          The instance refreshes for the specified group.

          (structure)
              Describes an instance refresh for an Auto Scaling group.

              InstanceRefreshId -> (string)
                 The instance refresh ID.

              AutoScalingGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the Auto Scaling group.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status for the instance refresh operation:

                 o Pending  -  The  request was created, but the operation has
                   not started.

                 o InProgress - The operation is in progress.

                 o Successful - The operation completed successfully.

                 o Failed - The operation failed to complete.  You  can  trou-
                   bleshoot  using  the  status reason and the scaling activi-
                   ties.

                 o Cancelling - An ongoing operation is being cancelled.  Can-
                   cellation  does  not  roll  back any replacements that have
                   already been completed, but it  prevents  new  replacements
                   from being started.

                 o Cancelled - The operation is cancelled.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Provides  more  details  about  the  current  status  of  the
                 instance refresh.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the instance refresh began.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the instance refresh ended.

              PercentageComplete -> (integer)
                 The percentage of the instance refresh that is complete.  For
                 each instance replacement, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tracks the
                 instance's  health  status  and  warm-up   time.   When   the
                 instance's health status changes to healthy and the specified
                 warm-up time passes, the instance is considered  updated  and
                 is added to the percentage complete.

              InstancesToUpdate -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  instances  remaining  to  update  before the
                 instance refresh is complete.

              ProgressDetails -> (structure)
                 Additional progress details for an Auto  Scaling  group  that
                 has a warm pool.

                 LivePoolProgress -> (structure)
                     Indicates   the   progress  of  an  instance  refresh  on
                     instances that are in the Auto Scaling group.

                     PercentageComplete -> (integer)
                        The percentage of instances in the Auto Scaling  group
                        that  have  been  replaced. For each instance replace-
                        ment, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  tracks  the  instance's
                        health  status  and  warm-up time. When the instance's
                        health status changes to  healthy  and  the  specified
                        warm-up   time  passes,  the  instance  is  considered
                        updated and is added to the percentage complete.

                     InstancesToUpdate -> (integer)
                        The number of instances remaining to update.

                 WarmPoolProgress -> (structure)
                     Indicates  the  progress  of  an  instance   refresh   on
                     instances that are in the warm pool.

                     PercentageComplete -> (integer)
                        The percentage of instances in the warm pool that have
                        been replaced. For each instance  replacement,  Amazon
                        EC2  Auto  Scaling tracks the instance's health status
                        and warm-up time. When the  instance's  health  status
                        changes  to  healthy  and  the  specified warm-up time
                        passes, the instance  is  considered  updated  and  is
                        added to the percentage complete.

                     InstancesToUpdate -> (integer)
                        The number of instances remaining to update.

              Preferences -> (structure)
                 Describes the preferences for an instance refresh.

                 MinHealthyPercentage -> (integer)
                     The  amount  of  capacity  in the Auto Scaling group that
                     must remain healthy during an instance refresh  to  allow
                     the  operation  to  continue. The value is expressed as a
                     percentage of the desired capacity of  the  Auto  Scaling
                     group (rounded up to the nearest integer). The default is
                     90 .

                     Setting the minimum healthy  percentage  to  100  percent
                     limits the rate of replacement to one instance at a time.
                     In contrast, setting it to 0 percent has  the  effect  of
                     replacing all instances at the same time.

                 InstanceWarmup -> (integer)
                     The  number of seconds until a newly launched instance is
                     configured and ready to use. During this time, Amazon EC2
                     Auto  Scaling  does  not  immediately move on to the next
                     replacement. The default is to  use  the  value  for  the
                     health check grace period defined for the group.

                 CheckpointPercentages -> (list)
                     Threshold  values for each checkpoint in ascending order.
                     Each number must be unique. To replace all  instances  in
                     the Auto Scaling group, the last number in the array must
                     be 100 .

                     For usage examples, see Adding checkpoints to an instance
                     refresh in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     (integer)

                 CheckpointDelay -> (integer)
                     The  amount  of  time, in seconds, to wait after a check-
                     point before continuing. This property is  optional,  but
                     if  you  specify  a value for it, you must also specify a
                     value for CheckpointPercentages . If you specify a  value
                     for  CheckpointPercentages  and not for CheckpointDelay ,
                     the CheckpointDelay defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

                 SkipMatching -> (boolean)
                     A boolean value that indicates whether skip  matching  is
                     enabled.  If  true,  then  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling skips
                     replacing instances that match the desired configuration.
                     If  no  desired configuration is specified, then it skips
                     replacing instances that have the same configuration that
                     is already set on the group. The default is false .

              DesiredConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Describes the specific update you want to deploy.

                 LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
                     Describes  the  launch  template  and  the version of the
                     launch template that Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling  uses  to
                     launch  Amazon  EC2 instances. For more information about
                     launch templates, see Launch templates in the Amazon  EC2
                     Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                        The ID of the launch template. To get the template ID,
                        use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API  opera-
                        tion.  New  launch  templates can be created using the
                        Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                        Conditional: You  must  specify  either  a  LaunchTem-
                        plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                     LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                        The  name  of the launch template. To get the template
                        name, use the Amazon EC2  DescribeLaunchTemplates  API
                        operation.  New  launch templates can be created using
                        the Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                        Conditional: You  must  specify  either  a  LaunchTem-
                        plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                     Version -> (string)
                        The version number, $Latest , or $Default . To get the
                        version     number,     use     the     Amazon     EC2
                        DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions   API   operation.  New
                        launch template versions can be created using the Ama-
                        zon  EC2 CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the value
                        is $Latest , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the  lat-
                        est  version  of  the  launch  template when launching
                        instances. If the value is $Default , Amazon EC2  Auto
                        Scaling selects the default version of the launch tem-
                        plate when launching instances. The default  value  is
                        $Default .

                 MixedInstancesPolicy -> (structure)
                     Describes  a  mixed  instances  policy. A mixed instances
                     policy contains the instance types that Amazon  EC2  Auto
                     Scaling  can launch and other information that Amazon EC2
                     Auto Scaling can use to launch instances and  help  opti-
                     mize  your  costs. For more information, see Auto Scaling
                     groups with multiple instance types and purchase  options
                     in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
                        Specifies  the launch template to use and the instance
                        types  (overrides)  that  are  used  to   launch   EC2
                        instances  to  fulfill  On-Demand and Spot capacities.
                        Required when creating a mixed instances policy.

                        LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                            The launch template to use.

                            LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                               The ID of the launch template. To get the  tem-
                               plate     ID,     use     the     Amazon    EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplates  API   operation.   New
                               launch  templates can be created using the Ama-
                               zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                               Conditional:  You   must   specify   either   a
                               LaunchTemplateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                            LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  launch template. To get the
                               template   name,    use    the    Amazon    EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplates   API   operation.  New
                               launch templates can be created using the  Ama-
                               zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                               Conditional:   You   must   specify   either  a
                               LaunchTemplateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                            Version -> (string)
                               The version number, $Latest , or $Default .  To
                               get  the  version  number,  use  the Amazon EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API  operation.
                               New  launch  template  versions  can be created
                               using          the          Amazon          EC2
                               CreateLaunchTemplateVersion  API.  If the value

                        Overrides -> (list)
                            Any  properties that you specify override the same
                            properties in the launch  template.  If  not  pro-
                            vided,  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling uses the instance
                            type or instance type  requirements  specified  in
                            the  launch template when it launches an instance.

                            The overrides  can  include  either  one  or  more
                            instance  types or a set of instance requirements,
                            but not both.

                                   The instance type, such as m3.xlarge .  You
                                   must use an instance type that is supported
                                   in your requested Region  and  Availability
                                   Zones.  For  more information, see Instance

                               WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                                   The  number  of  capacity units provided by
                                   the instance type specified in InstanceType
                                   in  terms of virtual CPUs, memory, storage,
                                   throughput, or other  relative  performance
                                   characteristic.  When  a  Spot or On-Demand
                                   Instance is launched,  the  capacity  units
                                   count  toward  the desired capacity. Amazon
                                   EC2 Auto Scaling launches  instances  until
                                   the  desired capacity is totally fulfilled,
                                   even if this results  in  an  overage.  For
                                   example,  if  there are two units remaining
                                   to fulfill capacity, and  Amazon  EC2  Auto
                                   Scaling  can only launch an instance with a
                                   WeightedCapacity   of   five   units,   the
                                   instance   is  launched,  and  the  desired
                                   capacity is exceeded by  three  units.  For
                                   more  information,  see  Instance weighting

                            ing the lowest price first.

                            If you specify prioritized , Amazon EC2 Auto Scal-
                            ing uses the priority that you  assigned  to  each
                            launch  template  override,  launching the highest
                            priority first. If  all  your  On-Demand  capacity
                            cannot  be  fulfilled  using your highest priority
                            instance, then Amazon EC2  Auto  Scaling  launches
                            the  remaining  capacity using the second priority
                            instance type, and so on.

                            Default: lowest-price for Auto Scaling groups that
                            specify  InstanceRequirements in the overrides and
                            prioritized for Auto Scaling groups that don't.

                        OnDemandBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                            The minimum amount of  the  Auto  Scaling  group's
                            capacity  that  must  be  fulfilled  by  On-Demand
                            Instances. This base portion is launched first  as
                            your group scales.

                            If  you  specify weights for the instance types in
                            the overrides, the base capacity  is  measured  in
                            the  same  unit  of  measurement  as  the instance
                            types. If you specify  InstanceRequirements in the
                            overrides,  the  base  capacity is measured in the
                            same unit of measurement as your  group's  desired
                            capacity.

                            Default: 0

                        OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                            Controls  the  percentages  of On-Demand Instances
                            and Spot Instances for  your  additional  capacity
                            beyond  OnDemandBaseCapacity . Expressed as a num-
                            ber  (for  example,  20  specifies  20%  On-Demand
                            Instances,  80%  Spot  Instances).  If set to 100,
                            only On-Demand Instances are used.

                            Default: 100

                        SpotAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                            Indicates how to allocate  instances  across  Spot
                            Instance pools.

                            If  the  allocation strategy is lowest-price , the
                            Auto Scaling group launches  instances  using  the
                            Spot pools with the lowest price, and evenly allo-
                            cates your instances across  the  number  of  Spot
                            pools that you specify.

                            If  the  allocation strategy is capacity-optimized
                            (recommended), the  Auto  Scaling  group  launches
                            instances using Spot pools that are optimally cho-
                            sen based on the available Spot capacity. Alterna-
                            tively, you can use capacity-optimized-prioritized
                            and set the order of instance types in the list of
                            launch  template  overrides from highest to lowest
                            priority (from first to last in the list).  Amazon
                            EC2  Auto Scaling honors the instance type priori-
                            ties on a  best-effort  basis  but  optimizes  for
                            capacity first.

                            Default: lowest-price

                        SpotInstancePools -> (integer)
                            The  number of Spot Instance pools across which to
                            allocate your Spot Instances. The Spot  pools  are
                            determined  from  the  different instance types in
                            the overrides. Valid only when the Spot allocation
                            strategy  is  lowest-price  . Value must be in the
                            range of 120.

                            Default: 2

                        SpotMaxPrice -> (string)
                            The maximum price per unit hour that you are will-
                            ing  to  pay  for a Spot Instance. If you keep the
                            value at its  default  (unspecified),  Amazon  EC2
                            Auto Scaling uses the On-Demand price as the maxi-
                            mum Spot price. To remove a value that you  previ-
                            ously  set,  include  the  property but specify an
                            empty string ("") for the value.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A string that indicates that the response contains more  items  than
          can  be  returned in a single response. To receive additional items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set  of  items.  This  value is null when there are no more items to
          return.
