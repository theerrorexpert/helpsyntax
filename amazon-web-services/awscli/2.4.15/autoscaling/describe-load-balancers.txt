DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()                            DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()



NAME
       describe-load-balancers -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information about the load balancers for the specified Auto Scal-
       ing group.

       This operation describes only  Classic  Load  Balancers.  If  you  have
       Application  Load  Balancers,  Network  Load Balancers, or Gateway Load
       Balancers, use the  DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups API instead.

       To determine the availability of registered instances,  use  the  State
       element  in  the  response.  When you attach a load balancer to an Auto
       Scaling group, the initial State value is Adding .  The  state  transi-
       tions to Added after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the
       load balancer. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled  for
       the  Auto  Scaling  group,  the state transitions to InService after at
       least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the  load
       balancer  is in the InService state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can termi-
       nate and replace any instances that are reported as  unhealthy.  If  no
       registered  instances pass the health checks, the load balancer doesn't
       enter the InService state.

       Load balancers also have an InService state if you attach them  in  the
       CreateAutoScalingGroup  API call. If your load balancer state is InSer-
       vice , but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities  by
       calling  DescribeScalingActivities and take any corrective actions nec-
       essary.

       For help with failed health checks, see Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto
       Scaling:  Health checks in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide . For
       more information, see Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 Auto  Scal-
       ing in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       describe-load-balancers  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: LoadBalancers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancers
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the Classic Load Balancers for an Auto Scaling group

       This  example  describes  the  Classic Load Balancers for the specified
       Auto Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling describe-load-balancers \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

       Output:

          {
              "LoadBalancers": [
                  {
                      "State": "Added",
                      "LoadBalancerName": "my-load-balancer"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       LoadBalancers -> (list)
          The load balancers.

          (structure)
              Describes the state of a Classic Load Balancer.

              LoadBalancerName -> (string)
                 The name of the load balancer.

              State -> (string)
                 One of the following load balancer states:

                 o Adding - The Auto Scaling instances  are  being  registered
                   with the load balancer.

                 o Added  - All Auto Scaling instances are registered with the
                   load balancer.

                 o InService - At least one Auto Scaling  instance  passed  an
                   ELB health check.

                 o Removing  -  The  Auto Scaling instances are being deregis-
                   tered from the load balancer.  If  connection  draining  is
                   enabled,   Elastic   Load  Balancing  waits  for  in-flight
                   requests to complete before deregistering the instances.

                 o Removed - All Auto Scaling instances are deregistered  from
                   the load balancer.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  string  that indicates that the response contains more items than
          can be returned in a single response. To receive  additional  items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are  no  more  items  to
          return.
