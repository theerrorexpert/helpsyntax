DESCRIBE-POLICIES()                                        DESCRIBE-POLICIES()



NAME
       describe-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information about the scaling policies in the account and Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-policies is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ScalingPolicies

SYNOPSIS
            describe-policies
          [--auto-scaling-group-name <value>]
          [--policy-names <value>]
          [--policy-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --policy-names (list)
          The  names  of one or more policies. If you omit this parameter, all
          policies are described. If a group name is provided, the results are
          limited  to that group. If you specify an unknown policy name, it is
          ignored with no error.

          Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --policy-types (list)
          One or more policy types. The valid values are SimpleScaling , Step-
          Scaling , TargetTrackingScaling , and PredictiveScaling .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To describe the scaling policies of a specified name

       To return specific scaling policies, use the --policy-names option.

          aws autoscaling describe-policies \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --policy-names cpu40-target-tracking-scaling-policy

       See example 1 for sample output.

       For more information, see Dynamic scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto  Scal-
       ing User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe a number of scaling policies

       To return a specific number of policies, use the --max-items option.

          aws autoscaling describe-policies \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --max-items 1

       See example 1 for sample output.

       If  the  output includes a NextToken field, use the value of this field
       with the --starting-token option in a subsequent call to get the  addi-
       tional policies.

          aws autoscaling describe-policies --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

                 For more information, see Target  tracking  scaling  policies
                 and  Step  and simple scaling policies in the Amazon EC2 Auto
                 Scaling User Guide .

              AdjustmentType -> (string)
                 Specifies how the  scaling  adjustment  is  interpreted  (for
                 example,  an absolute number or a percentage). The valid val-
                 ues  are  ChangeInCapacity  ,  ExactCapacity   ,   and   Per-
                 centChangeInCapacity .

              MinAdjustmentStep -> (integer)
                 Available for backward compatibility. Use MinAdjustmentMagni-
                 tude instead.

              MinAdjustmentMagnitude -> (integer)
                 The minimum value to scale by when  the  adjustment  type  is
                 PercentChangeInCapacity .

              ScalingAdjustment -> (integer)
                 The  amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjust-
                 ment type. A positive value  adds  to  the  current  capacity
                 while a negative number removes from the current capacity.

              Cooldown -> (integer)
                 The duration of the policy's cooldown period, in seconds.

              StepAdjustments -> (list)
                 A  set  of  adjustments that enable you to scale based on the
                 size of the alarm breach.

                 (structure)
                     Describes information used to create  a  step  adjustment
                     for a step scaling policy.

                     For  the  following  examples,  suppose  that you have an
                     alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

                     o To trigger the adjustment when the  metric  is  greater
                       than  or  equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower
                       bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

                     o To trigger the adjustment when the  metric  is  greater
                       than  40  and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower
                       bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

                     There are a few rules for the step adjustments  for  your
                     step policy:

                     o The  ranges  of  your step adjustments can't overlap or
                       have a gap.

                     o At most, one step adjustment  can  have  a  null  lower
                       bound.  If  one  step  adjustment  has a negative lower
                       bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null
                       lower bound.

                     o At  most,  one  step  adjustment  can have a null upper
                       bound. If one step  adjustment  has  a  positive  upper
                       bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null
                       upper bound.

                     o The upper and lower bound can't be  null  in  the  same
                       step adjustment.

                     For  more information, see Step adjustments in the Amazon
                     EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     MetricIntervalLowerBound -> (double)
                        The lower bound for the difference between  the  alarm
                        threshold  and  the  CloudWatch  metric. If the metric
                        value is above the breach threshold, the  lower  bound
                        is inclusive (the metric must be greater than or equal
                        to the threshold plus the lower bound). Otherwise,  it
                        is  exclusive  (the  metric  must  be greater than the
                        threshold plus the lower bound). A  null  value  indi-
                        cates negative infinity.

                     MetricIntervalUpperBound -> (double)
                        The  upper  bound for the difference between the alarm
                        threshold and the CloudWatch  metric.  If  the  metric
                        value  is  above the breach threshold, the upper bound
                        is exclusive (the metric must be less than the thresh-
                        old  plus the upper bound). Otherwise, it is inclusive
                        (the metric must be less than or equal to the  thresh-
                        old plus the upper bound). A null value indicates pos-
                        itive infinity.

                        The upper bound must be greater than the lower  bound.

                     ScalingAdjustment -> (integer)
                        The  amount  by which to scale, based on the specified
                        adjustment type. A positive value adds to the  current
                        capacity while a negative number removes from the cur-
                        rent capacity.

              MetricAggregationType -> (string)
                 The aggregation type for the CloudWatch  metrics.  The  valid
                 values are Minimum , Maximum , and Average .

              EstimatedInstanceWarmup -> (integer)
                 The  estimated  time,  in  seconds,  until  a  newly launched
                 instance can contribute to the CloudWatch metrics.

              Alarms -> (list)
                 The CloudWatch alarms related to the policy.

                 (structure)
                     Describes an alarm.

                     AlarmName -> (string)
                        The name of the alarm.

                     AlarmARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the alarm.

              TargetTrackingConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A target tracking scaling policy.

                 PredefinedMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                     A predefined metric. You must specify either a predefined
                     metric or a customized metric.

                     PredefinedMetricType -> (string)
                        The  metric type. The following predefined metrics are
                        available:

                        o ASGAverageCPUUtilization - Average  CPU  utilization
                          of the Auto Scaling group.

                        o ASGAverageNetworkIn   -   Average  number  of  bytes
                          received on all network interfaces by the Auto Scal-
                          ing group.

                        o ASGAverageNetworkOut  - Average number of bytes sent
                          out on all network interfaces by  the  Auto  Scaling
                          group.

                        o ALBRequestCountPerTarget  -  Number of requests com-
                          pleted per target in an  Application  Load  Balancer
                          target group.

                     ResourceLabel -> (string)
                        A  label  that uniquely identifies a specific Applica-
                        tion Load Balancer target group from which  to  deter-
                        mine  the  average  request  count served by your Auto
                        Scaling group. You  can't  specify  a  resource  label
                        unless  the target group is attached to the Auto Scal-
                        ing group.

                        You create the resource label by appending  the  final
                        portion of the load balancer ARN and the final portion
                        of the target group ARN into a single value, separated
                        by  a  forward  slash  (/). The format of the resource
                        label is:
                            app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/target-
                            group/my-alb-target-group/943f017f100becff .

                        Where:

                        o app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>  is  the
                          final portion of the load balancer ARN

                        o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id> is
                          the final portion of the target group ARN.

                        To  find the ARN for an Application Load Balancer, use
                        the DescribeLoadBalancers API operation. To  find  the
                        ARN for the target group, use the DescribeTargetGroups
                        API operation.

                 CustomizedMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                     A customized metric. You must specify either a predefined
                     metric or a customized metric.

                     MetricName -> (string)
                        The  name of the metric. To get the exact metric name,
                        namespace, and dimensions, inspect the  Metric  object
                        that is returned by a call to ListMetrics .

                     Namespace -> (string)
                        The namespace of the metric.

                     Dimensions -> (list)
                        The dimensions of the metric.

                        Conditional:  If you published your metric with dimen-
                        sions, you must specify the same  dimensions  in  your
                        scaling policy.

                        (structure)
                            Describes the dimension of a metric.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the dimension.

                            Value -> (string)
                               The value of the dimension.

                     Statistic -> (string)
                        The statistic of the metric.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The  unit  of  the  metric. For a complete list of the
                        units that CloudWatch supports,  see  the  MetricDatum
                        data type in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference .

                 TargetValue -> (double)
                     The target value for the metric.

                 DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether scaling in by the target tracking scal-
                     ing policy is disabled. If scaling in  is  disabled,  the
                     target  tracking  scaling policy doesn't remove instances
                     from the Auto Scaling group. Otherwise, the target track-
                     ing  scaling  policy  can  remove instances from the Auto
                     Scaling group. The default is false .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the policy is enabled (true )  or  disabled
                 (false ).

              PredictiveScalingConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A predictive scaling policy.

                 MetricSpecifications -> (list)
                     This  structure  includes the metrics and target utiliza-
                     tion to use for predictive scaling.

                     This is an array, but we currently only support a  single
                     metric  specification.  That is, you can specify a target
                     value and a single metric pair, or a target value and one
                     scaling metric and one load metric.

                     (structure)
                        This  structure  specifies the metrics and target uti-
                        lization settings for a predictive scaling policy.

                        You must specify either a metric pair, or a load  met-
                        ric  and  a  scaling metric individually. Specifying a
                        metric pair instead of individual metrics  provides  a
                        simpler way to configure metrics for a scaling policy.
                        You choose the metric pair, and the  policy  automati-
                        cally  knows the correct sum and average statistics to
                        use for the load metric and the scaling metric.

                        Example

                        o You create a predictive scaling policy  and  specify
                          ALBRequestCount as the value for the metric pair and
                          1000.0 as the target value. For this type of metric,
                          you must provide the metric dimension for the corre-
                          sponding  target  group,  so  you  also  provide   a
                          resource  label  for  the  Application Load Balancer
                          target group that is attached to your  Auto  Scaling
                          group.

                        o The number of requests the target group receives per
                          minute provides the load  metric,  and  the  request
                          count  averaged  between  the  members of the target
                          group provides the scaling  metric.  In  CloudWatch,
                          this refers to the RequestCount and RequestCountPer-
                          Target metrics, respectively.

                        o For optimal use of predictive scaling, you adhere to
                          the  best practice of using a dynamic scaling policy
                          to automatically scale between the minimum  capacity
                          and   maximum  capacity  in  response  to  real-time
                          changes in resource utilization.

                        o Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling consumes data points for the
                          load  metric  over  the  last 14 days and creates an
                          hourly load forecast for predictive scaling. (A min-
                          imum of 24 hours of data is required.)

                        o After  creating  the  load forecast, Amazon EC2 Auto
                          Scaling determines when to reduce  or  increase  the
                          capacity  of your Auto Scaling group in each hour of
                          the forecast period so that the  average  number  of
                          requests  received  by  each instance is as close to
                          1000 requests per minute as possible at all times.

                        dictive  scaling, see Advanced predictive scaling pol-
                        icy configurations using custom metrics in the  Amazon
                        EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                        TargetValue -> (double)
                            Specifies the target utilization.

                            NOTE:
                               Some  metrics are based on a count instead of a
                               percentage, such as the request  count  for  an
                               Application Load Balancer or the number of mes-
                               sages in an SQS queue. If  the  scaling  policy
                               specifies  one  of  these  metrics, specify the
                               target  utilization  as  the  optimal   average
                               request  or  message  count per instance during
                               any one-minute interval.

                        PredefinedMetricPairSpecification -> (structure)
                            The  predefined  metric  pair  specification  from
                            which  Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling  determines  the
                            appropriate scaling metric and load metric to use.

                            PredefinedMetricType -> (string)
                               Indicates  which  metrics to use. There are two
                               different types  of  metrics  for  each  metric
                               type: one is a load metric and one is a scaling
                               metric. For example,  if  the  metric  type  is
                               ASGCPUUtilization  ,  the  Auto Scaling group's
                               total CPU metric is used as  the  load  metric,
                               and  the  average  CPU  metric  is used for the
                               scaling metric.

                            ResourceLabel -> (string)
                               A label that  uniquely  identifies  a  specific
                               Application  Load  Balancer  target  group from
                               which  to  determine  the  total  and   average
                               request  count  served  by  your  Auto  Scaling
                               group.  You  can't  specify  a  resource  label
                               unless the target group is attached to the Auto
                               Scaling group.

                               You create the resource label by appending  the
                               final  portion of the load balancer ARN and the
                               final portion of the target group  ARN  into  a
                               single value, separated by a forward slash (/).
                               The format of the resource label is:
                                   app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/target-
                                   group/my-alb-target-group/943f017f100becff
                                   .

                               Where:

                               o app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>
                                 is the final portion of the load balancer ARN

                               o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<tar-
                                 get-group-id>  is  the  final  portion of the
                                 target group ARN.

                               The metric type.

                            ResourceLabel -> (string)
                               A  label  that  uniquely  identifies a specific
                               Application Load  Balancer  target  group  from
                               which  to  determine  the average request count
                               served by your Auto Scaling  group.  You  can't
                               specify  a  resource  label  unless  the target
                               group is attached to the Auto Scaling group.

                               You create the resource label by appending  the

                               final portion of the target group  ARN  into  a
                               single value, separated by a forward slash (/).
                               The format of the resource label is:
                                   app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/target-

                                      or expression. This is especially useful
                                      if  this  is  a math expression, so that
                                      you know what the value represents.

                                   ReturnData -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates whether to  return  the  time-

                                      ric.

                                      If you use any math expressions, specify
                                      true  for  this value for only the final
                                      math expression that the metric specifi-
                                      cation  is  based  on.  You must specify
                                      false for ReturnData for all  the  other
                                      metrics and expressions used in the met-
                                      ric specification.

                                      If you are only retrieving  metrics  and
                                      not  performing any math expressions, do
                                      not specify anything  for  ReturnData  .
                                      This sets it to its default (true ).

                                          The  most  commonly used metrics for
                                          predictive scaling are  Average  and
                                          Sum .

                                      Unit -> (string)
                                          The  unit  to  use  for the returned
                                          data points. For a complete list  of

                                   Label -> (string)
                                      A  human-readable  label for this metric
                                      or expression. This is especially useful
                                      if  this  is  a math expression, so that
                                      you know what the value represents.

                                   ReturnData -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates whether to  return  the  time-
                                      stamps  and raw data values of this met-
                                      ric.

                                      If you use any math expressions, specify
                                      true  for  this value for only the final
                                      math expression that the metric specifi-
                                      cation  is  based  on.  You must specify
                                      false for ReturnData for all  the  other
                                      metrics and expressions used in the met-
                                      ric specification.

                                      If you are only retrieving  metrics  and
                                      not  performing any math expressions, do
                                      not specify anything  for  ReturnData  .
                                      This sets it to its default (true ).

                        CustomizedCapacityMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                            The customized capacity metric specification.

                            MetricDataQueries -> (list)
                               One  or more metric data queries to provide the
                               data points for a capacity metric. Use multiple
                               metric  data queries only if you are performing
                               a math expression on returned data.

                               (structure)
                                   The metric data  to  return.  Also  defines
                                   whether this call is returning data for one
                                   metric only, or whether it is performing  a
                                   math  expression  on the values of returned
                                   metric statistics  to  create  a  new  time
                                   series.  A  time series is a series of data
                                   points, each of which is associated with  a
                                   timestamp.

                                             Conditional:  If  you   published
                                             your  metric with dimensions, you
                                             must specify the same  dimensions
                                             in your scaling policy.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Describes  the dimension of a
                                                 metric.

                                                 Name -> (string)
                                                    The name of the dimension.

                                                 Value -> (string)
                                                    The  value  of  the dimen-
                                                    sion.

                                      Stat -> (string)
                                          The  statistic  to  return.  It  can
                                          include  any CloudWatch statistic or
                                          extended statistic. For  a  list  of
                                          valid   values,  see  the  table  in
                                          Statistics in the Amazon  CloudWatch
                                          User Guide .

                                          The  most  commonly used metrics for
                                          predictive scaling are  Average  and
                                          Sum .

                                      Unit -> (string)
                                          The  unit  to  use  for the returned
                                          data points. For a complete list  of
                                          the  units that CloudWatch supports,
                                          see the MetricDatum data type in the
                                          Amazon CloudWatch API Reference .

                                   Label -> (string)
                                      A  human-readable  label for this metric
                                      or expression. This is especially useful
                                      if  this  is  a math expression, so that
                                      you know what the value represents.

                                   ReturnData -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates whether to  return  the  time-
                                      stamps  and raw data values of this met-
                                      ric.

                                      If you use any math expressions, specify
                                      true  for  this value for only the final
                                      math expression that the metric specifi-
                                      cation  is  based  on.  You must specify
                                      false for ReturnData for all  the  other
                                      metrics and expressions used in the met-
                                      ric specification.

                                      If you are only retrieving  metrics  and
                                      not  performing any math expressions, do
                                      not specify anything  for  ReturnData  .
                                      This sets it to its default (true ).

                 Mode -> (string)
                     The  predictive scaling mode. Defaults to ForecastOnly if
                     not specified.

                 SchedulingBufferTime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds,  by  which  the  instance
                     launch  time  can  be advanced. For example, the forecast
                     says to add capacity at  10:00  AM,  and  you  choose  to
                     pre-launch  instances  by  5  minutes.  In that case, the
                     instances will be launched at 9:55 AM. The  intention  is
                     to  give  resources time to be provisioned. It can take a
                     few minutes to launch an EC2 instance. The actual  amount
                     of  time required depends on several factors, such as the
                     size of  the  instance  and  whether  there  are  startup
                     scripts to complete.

                     The  value  must be less than the forecast interval dura-
                     tion of 3600 seconds (60 minutes). Defaults to  300  sec-
                     onds if not specified.

                 MaxCapacityBreachBehavior -> (string)
                     Defines  the behavior that should be applied if the fore-
                     cast capacity approaches or exceeds the maximum  capacity
                     of  the  Auto Scaling group. Defaults to HonorMaxCapacity
                     if not specified.

                     The following are possible values:

                     o HonorMaxCapacity - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling cannot scale
                       out capacity higher than the maximum capacity. The max-
                       imum capacity is enforced as a hard limit.

                     o IncreaseMaxCapacity - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can scale
                       out  capacity higher than the maximum capacity when the
                       forecast capacity is close to or  exceeds  the  maximum
                       capacity.  The  upper  limit is determined by the fore-
                       casted capacity and the value for MaxCapacityBuffer .

                 MaxCapacityBuffer -> (integer)
                     The size of the capacity buffer to use when the  forecast
                     capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The
                     value is specified as a percentage relative to the  fore-
                     cast  capacity.  For  example,  if the buffer is 10, this
                     means a 10 percent buffer,  such  that  if  the  forecast
                     capacity  is 50, and the maximum capacity is 40, then the
                     effective maximum capacity is 55.

                     If set to 0, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may  scale  capacity
                     higher  than the maximum capacity to equal but not exceed
                     forecast capacity.

                     Required if the MaxCapacityBreachBehavior property is set
                     to IncreaseMaxCapacity , and cannot be used otherwise.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  string  that indicates that the response contains more items than
          can be returned in a single response. To receive  additional  items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are  no  more  items  to
          return.
