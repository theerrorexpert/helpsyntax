DESCRIBE-TAGS()                                                DESCRIBE-TAGS()



NAME
       describe-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified tags.

       You  can  use  filters to limit the results. For example, you can query
       for the tags for a specific Auto Scaling group. You can specify  multi-
       ple values for a filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified
       values for it to be included in the results.

       You can also specify multiple filters. The result includes  information
       for  a particular tag only if it matches all the filters. If there's no
       match, no special message is returned.

       For more information, see Tagging Auto Scaling groups and instances  in
       the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-tags  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Tags

SYNOPSIS
            describe-tags
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One or more filters to scope the tags to return. The maximum  number
          of  filters  per  filter  type (for example, auto-scaling-group ) is
          1000.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that is used to return a more  specific  list
              of results from a describe operation.

              If  you  specify multiple filters, the filters are automatically
              logically joined with an AND , and the request returns only  the
              results that match all of the specified filters.

              For  more  information,  see  Tagging  Auto  Scaling  groups and
              instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 The valid values for  Name  depend  on  which  API  operation
                 you're  using  with the filter ( DescribeAutoScalingGroups or
                 DescribeTags ).
                     DescribeAutoScalingGroups

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o tag-key - Accepts tag keys. The results only include infor-
                   mation  about the Auto Scaling groups associated with these
                   tag keys.

                 o tag-value - Accepts tag values. The  results  only  include
                   information  about  the Auto Scaling groups associated with
                   these tag values.

                 o tag:<key> - Accepts the key/value combination of  the  tag.
                   Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the
                   filter value. The results only  include  information  about
                   the  Auto  Scaling  groups  associated  with  the specified
                   key/value combination.
                     DescribeTags

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o auto-scaling-group - Accepts  the  names  of  Auto  Scaling
                   groups. The results only include information about the tags
                   associated with these Auto Scaling groups.

                 o key - Accepts tag keys. The results only  include  informa-
                   tion about the tags associated with these tag keys.

                 o value - Accepts tag values. The results only include infor-
                   mation about the tags associated with these tag values.

                 o propagate-at-launch - Accepts a Boolean value, which speci-
                   fies  whether  tags  propagate  to instances at launch. The
                   results only include information about the tags  associated
                   with the specified Boolean value.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 If you specify multiple values for a filter, the  values  are
                 automatically  logically  joined with an OR , and the request
                 returns all results that match any of the  specified  values.
                 For  example,  specify  "tag:environment" for the filter name
                 and "production,development" for the filter  values  to  find
                 Auto  Scaling groups with the tag "environment=production" or
                 "environment=development".

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe all tags

       This example describes all your tags.

          aws autoscaling describe-tags

       Output:

          {
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "auto-scaling-group",
                      "ResourceId": "my-asg",
                      "PropagateAtLaunch": true,
                      "Value": "Research",
                      "Key": "Dept"
                  },
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "auto-scaling-group",
                      "ResourceId": "my-asg",
                      "PropagateAtLaunch": true,
                      "Value": "WebServer",
                      "Key": "Role"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For  more information, see Tagging Auto Scaling groups and instances in
       the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

       Example 2: To describe tags for a specified group

       To describe tags for a specific Auto Scaling group, use  the  --filters
       option.

          aws autoscaling describe-tags --filters Name=auto-scaling-group,Values=my-asg

       For  more information, see Tagging Auto Scaling groups and instances in
       the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe the specified number of tags

       To return a specific number of tags, use the --max-items option.

          aws autoscaling describe-tags \
              --max-items 1

       If the output includes a NextToken field, there are more tags.  To  get
       the  additional  tags,  use  the  value of this field with the --start-
       ing-token option in a subsequent call as follows.

          aws autoscaling describe-tags \
              --filters Name=auto-scaling-group,Values=my-asg \
              --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

              Describes a tag for an Auto Scaling group.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The name of the group.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of resource. The only supported value is auto-scal-
                 ing-group .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

              PropagateAtLaunch -> (boolean)
                 Determines whether the tag is added to new instances as  they
                 are launched in the group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  string  that indicates that the response contains more items than
          can be returned in a single response. To receive  additional  items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are  no  more  items  to
          return.
