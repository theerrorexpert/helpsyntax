ENTER-STANDBY()                                                ENTER-STANDBY()



NAME
       enter-standby -

DESCRIPTION
       Moves the specified instances into the standby state.

       If  you  choose  to  decrement the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling
       group, the instances can enter standby as long as the desired  capacity
       of  the  Auto Scaling group after the instances are placed into standby
       is equal to or greater than the minimum capacity of the group.

       If you choose not to decrement the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling
       group,  the  Auto  Scaling  group launches new instances to replace the
       instances on standby.

       For more information, see Temporarily removing instances from your Auto
       Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            enter-standby
          [--instance-ids <value>]
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          --should-decrement-desired-capacity | --no-should-decrement-desired-capacity
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The IDs of the instances. You can specify up to 20 instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --should-decrement-desired-capacity         |        --no-should-decre-
       ment-desired-capacity (boolean)
          Indicates whether to decrement the  desired  capacity  of  the  Auto
          Scaling group by the number of instances moved to Standby mode.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To move instances into standby mode

       This  example  puts  the  specified instance into standby mode. This is
       useful for updating or troubleshooting an instance that is currently in
       service.

          aws autoscaling enter-standby \
              --instance-ids i-061c63c5eb45f0416 \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --should-decrement-desired-capacity

       Output:

          {
              "Activities": [
                  {
                      "ActivityId": "ffa056b4-6ed3-41ba-ae7c-249dfae6eba1",
                      "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
                      "Description": "Moving EC2 instance to Standby: i-061c63c5eb45f0416",
                      "Cause": "At 2020-10-31T20:31:00Z instance i-061c63c5eb45f0416 was moved to standby in response to a user request, shrinking the capacity from 1 to 0.",
                      "StartTime": "2020-10-31T20:31:00.949Z",
                      "StatusCode": "InProgress",

                      "Details": "{\"Subnet ID\":\"subnet-6194ea3b\",\"Availability Zone\":\"us-west-2c\"}"
                  }
              ]
          }
