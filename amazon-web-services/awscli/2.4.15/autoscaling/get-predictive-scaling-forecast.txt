NAME
       get-predictive-scaling-forecast -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the forecast data for a predictive scaling policy.

       Load forecasts are predictions of the hourly load values using histori-
       cal load data from CloudWatch and an  analysis  of  historical  trends.
       Capacity  forecasts are represented as predicted values for the minimum
       capacity that is needed on an hourly basis, based on  the  hourly  load
       forecast.

       A  minimum  of 24 hours of data is required to create the initial fore-
       casts. However, having a full 14 days of  historical  data  results  in
       more accurate forecasts.

       For  more information, see Predictive scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scal-
       ing in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-predictive-scaling-forecast
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          --policy-name <value>
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The inclusive start time of the time range for the forecast data  to
          get.  At  most, the date and time can be one year before the current
          date and time.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The exclusive end time of the time range for the  forecast  data  to
          get.  The maximum time duration between the start and end time is 30
          days.

          Although this parameter can accept a date and time that is more than
          two  days  in the future, the availability of forecast data has lim-
          its. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling only issues forecasts  for  periods  of
          two days in advance.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LoadForecast -> (list)
          The load forecast.

          (structure)
              A  GetPredictiveScalingForecast  call  returns the load forecast
              for a predictive scaling policy.  This  structure  includes  the
              data points for that load forecast, along with the timestamps of
              those data points and the metric specification.

              Timestamps -> (list)
                 The timestamps for the data points, in UTC format.

                 (timestamp)

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of the data points.

                 (double)

              MetricSpecification -> (structure)
                 The metric specification for the load forecast.

                 TargetValue -> (double)
                     Specifies the target utilization.

                     NOTE:
                        Some metrics are based on a count instead  of  a  per-
                        centage,  such as the request count for an Application
                        Load Balancer or the number  of  messages  in  an  SQS
                        queue.  If  the  scaling policy specifies one of these
                        metrics, specify the target utilization as the optimal
                        average  request  or message count per instance during
                        any one-minute interval.

                 PredefinedMetricPairSpecification -> (structure)
                     The predefined metric pair specification from which  Ama-
                     zon  EC2  Auto Scaling determines the appropriate scaling
                     metric and load metric to use.

                     PredefinedMetricType -> (string)
                        Indicates which metrics to use. There are two  differ-
                        ent  types  of  metrics for each metric type: one is a
                        load metric and one is a scaling metric. For  example,
                        if  the  metric  type  is ASGCPUUtilization , the Auto
                        Scaling group's total CPU metric is used as  the  load
                        metric,  and  the  average  CPU metric is used for the
                        scaling metric.

                     ResourceLabel -> (string)
                        A label that uniquely identifies a  specific  Applica-
                        tion  Load  Balancer target group from which to deter-
                        mine the total and average  request  count  served  by
                        your  Auto Scaling group. You can't specify a resource
                        label unless the target group is attached to the  Auto
                        Scaling group.

                        You  create  the resource label by appending the final
                        portion of the load balancer ARN and the final portion
                        of the target group ARN into a single value, separated
                        by a forward slash (/). The  format  of  the  resource
                        label is:
                            app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/target-
                            group/my-alb-target-group/943f017f100becff .

                          final portion of the load balancer ARN

                        o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id> is
                          the final portion of the target group ARN.

                        To find the ARN for an Application Load Balancer,  use
                        the  DescribeLoadBalancers  API operation. To find the
                        ARN for the target group, use the DescribeTargetGroups

                        tion Load Balancer target group from which  to  deter-
                        mine  the  average  request  count served by your Auto
                        Scaling group. You  can't  specify  a  resource  label
                        unless  the target group is attached to the Auto Scal-
                        ing group.

                        You create the resource label by appending  the  final
                        portion of the load balancer ARN and the final portion
                        of the target group ARN into a single value, separated
                        by  a  forward  slash  (/). The format of the resource
                        label is:

                          the final portion of the target group ARN.

                        To  find the ARN for an Application Load Balancer, use
                        the DescribeLoadBalancers API operation. To  find  the

                            this call is returning data for one  metric  only,
                            or  whether  it is performing a math expression on

                            Id -> (string)
                               A  short  name  that  identifies  the  object's
                               results  in  the  response.  This  name must be
                               unique among all MetricDataQuery objects speci-
                               fied  for  a  single scaling policy. If you are
                               performing math  expressions  on  this  set  of
                               data,  this  name  represents that data and can
                               serve as a variable in the mathematical expres-
                               sion.  The  valid  characters are letters, num-
                               bers, and underscores. The first character must
                               be a lowercase letter.

                            Expression -> (string)

                               expression.  This  expression can use the Id of
                               the other metrics to refer  to  those  metrics,
                               and can also use the Id of other expressions to
                               use the result of those expressions.

                               Conditional:   Within   each    MetricDataQuery

                               expression.  This  is especially useful if this
                               is a math expression, so that you know what the
                               value represents.

                            ReturnData -> (boolean)

                               raw data values of this metric.

                               If you use any math expressions,  specify  true
                               for  this value for only the final math expres-
                               sion that the metric specification is based on.
                               You  must  specify false for ReturnData for all
                               the other metrics and expressions used  in  the
                               metric specification.

                               forming any math expressions,  do  not  specify
                               anything  for  ReturnData . This sets it to its

                        on returned data.

                        (structure)
                            The  metric  data  to return. Also defines whether
                            this call is returning data for one  metric  only,
                            or  whether  it is performing a math expression on
                            the values of returned metric statistics to create
                            a  new  time  series. A time series is a series of
                            data points, each of which is  associated  with  a

                               expression.  This  expression can use the Id of
                               the other metrics to refer  to  those  metrics,
                               and can also use the Id of other expressions to
                               use the result of those expressions.

                                      (structure)
                                          Describes the dimension of a metric.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the dimension.

                                          Value -> (string)

                                   The  most commonly used metrics for predic-
                                   tive scaling are Average and Sum .

                               Unit -> (string)
                                   The unit  to  use  for  the  returned  data
                                   points.  For  a  complete list of the units
                                   that   CloudWatch   supports,    see    the

                            Label -> (string)
                               A  human-readable  label  for  this  metric  or
                               expression.  This  is especially useful if this
                               is a math expression, so that you know what the
                               value represents.

                            ReturnData -> (boolean)
                               Indicates  whether to return the timestamps and
                               raw data values of this metric.

                               If you use any math expressions,  specify  true
                               for  this value for only the final math expres-
                               sion that the metric specification is based on.
                               You  must  specify false for ReturnData for all
                               the other metrics and expressions used  in  the
                               metric specification.

                               If you are only retrieving metrics and not per-
                               forming any math expressions,  do  not  specify
                               anything  for  ReturnData . This sets it to its
                               default (true ).

       CapacityForecast -> (structure)
          The capacity forecast.

          Timestamps -> (list)
              The timestamps for the data points, in UTC format.

              (timestamp)

          Values -> (list)
              The values of the data points.

              (double)

       UpdateTime -> (timestamp)
          The time the forecast was made.
