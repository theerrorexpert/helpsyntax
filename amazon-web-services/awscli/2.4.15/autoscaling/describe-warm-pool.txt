NAME
       describe-warm-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a warm pool and its instances.

       For more information, see Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-warm-pool
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of instances to return with this call. The  maxi-
          mum value is 50 .

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  for  the  next set of instances to return. (You received
          this token from a previous call.)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WarmPoolConfiguration -> (structure)
          The warm pool configuration details.

          MaxGroupPreparedCapacity -> (integer)
              The maximum number of instances that are allowed to  be  in  the
              warm pool or in any state except Terminated for the Auto Scaling
              group.

          MinSize -> (integer)
              The minimum number of instances to maintain in the warm pool.

          PoolState -> (string)
              The instance state to transition to after the lifecycle  actions
              are complete.

          (structure)
              Describes an EC2 instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The instance type of the EC2 instance.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)

              LifecycleState -> (string)
                 A description of the current lifecycle state. The Quarantined

              HealthStatus -> (string)
                 The last reported health status of  the  instance.  "Healthy"
                 means  that the instance is healthy and should remain in ser-
                 vice. "Unhealthy" means that the instance  is  unhealthy  and
                 that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling should terminate and replace it.

              LaunchConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The launch configuration associated with the instance.

              LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
                 The launch template for the instance.

                 LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                     The ID of the launch template. To get  the  template  ID,
                     use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation.
                     New launch templates can be created using the Amazon  EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional:  You  must specify either a LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                     The name of the launch  template.  To  get  the  template
                     name,  use  the  Amazon  EC2  DescribeLaunchTemplates API
                     operation. New launch templates can be created using  the
                     Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional:  You  must specify either a LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 Version -> (string)
                     The version number, $Latest , or $Default .  To  get  the
                     version      number,      use      the     Amazon     EC2
                     DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions API operation. New  launch
                     template  versions  can  be  created using the Amazon EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the value is  $Latest
                     ,  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling selects the latest version of
                     the launch template  when  launching  instances.  If  the
                     value  is  $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the
                     default version of the  launch  template  when  launching
                     instances. The default value is $Default .

              ProtectedFromScaleIn -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether the instance is protected from termination
                 by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in.

              WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                 The number of capacity  units  contributed  by  the  instance
                 based on its instance type.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  for  the next set of items to return. (You received this
          token from a previous call.)
