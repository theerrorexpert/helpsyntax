DESCRIBE-SCALING-ACTIVITIES()                    DESCRIBE-SCALING-ACTIVITIES()



NAME
       describe-scaling-activities -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  the  scaling  activities  in  the account and
       Region.

       When scaling events occur, you see a record of the scaling activity  in
       the  scaling  activities. For more information, see Verifying a scaling
       activity for an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  User
       Guide .

       If  the  scaling event succeeds, the value of the StatusCode element in
       the response is Successful . If an attempt to launch instances  failed,
       the  StatusCode value is Failed or Cancelled and the StatusMessage ele-
       ment in the response indicates the  cause  of  the  failure.  For  help
       interpreting  the  StatusMessage  , see Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto
       Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-scaling-activities is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Activities

SYNOPSIS
            describe-scaling-activities
          [--activity-ids <value>]
          [--auto-scaling-group-name <value>]
          [--include-deleted-groups | --no-include-deleted-groups]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --activity-ids (list)
          The activity IDs of the desired scaling activities. If you omit this
          parameter, all activities for the past six weeks are  described.  If
          unknown activities are requested, they are ignored with no error. If
          you specify an Auto Scaling group, the results are limited  to  that
          group.

          Array Members: Maximum number of 50 IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --include-deleted-groups | --no-include-deleted-groups (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  to  include  scaling  activity from deleted Auto
          Scaling groups.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To describe scaling activities for the specified group

       This  example  describes  the scaling activities for the specified Auto
       Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

       Output:

          {
              "Activities": [
                  {
                      "ActivityId": "f9f2d65b-f1f2-43e7-b46d-d86756459699",

          }

       Example 2: To describe the scaling activities of the specified activity
       ID

       To describe a specific scaling activity, use the --activity-ids option.

          aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities \
              --activity-ids b55c7b67-c8aa-4d10-b240-730ff91d8895

       Output:

          {

                      "StartTime": "2020-10-30T19:36:09.766Z",

                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 3: To describe a specified number of scaling activities

       To return a specific number of activities, use the --max-items  option.

          aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --max-items 1

       Output:

          {
              "Activities": [
                  {
                      "ActivityId": "f9f2d65b-f1f2-43e7-b46d-d86756459699",
                      "Description": "Launching a new EC2 instance: i-0d44425630326060f",
                      "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
                      "Cause": "At 2020-10-30T19:35:51Z a user request update of AutoScalingGroup constraints to min: 0, max: 16, desired: 16 changing the desired capacity from 0 to 16.

                      "StartTime": "2020-10-30T19:36:09.766Z",
                      "EndTime": "2020-10-30T19:36:41Z",
                      "StatusCode": "Successful",
                      "Progress": 100,
                      "Details": "{\"Subnet ID\":\"subnet-5ea0c127\",\"Availability Zone\":\"us-west-2b\"}"
                  }
              ]
          }

       If the output includes a NextToken field, there are more activities. To
       get the additional activities, use the value of  this  field  with  the
       --starting-token option in a subsequent call as follows.

          aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

          (structure)
              Describes scaling activity, which is a long-running process that
              represents a change to your Auto Scaling group, such as changing
              its size or replacing an instance.

                 The current status of the activity.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A friendly, more verbose description of the activity  status.

              Progress -> (integer)
                 A  value between 0 and 100 that indicates the progress of the
                 activity.

              Details -> (string)
                 The details about the activity.

              AutoScalingGroupState -> (string)
                 The state of the Auto Scaling group, which is  either  InSer-
                 vice or Deleted .

              AutoScalingGroupARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Auto Scaling group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  string  that indicates that the response contains more items than
          can be returned in a single response. To receive  additional  items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are  no  more  items  to
          return.
