NAME
       describe-launch-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  the  launch configurations in the account and
       Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-launch-configurations is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: LaunchConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            describe-launch-configurations
          [--launch-configuration-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --launch-configuration-names (list)
          The  launch  configuration  names.  If  you omit this parameter, all
          launch configurations are described.

          Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To describe a specified number of launch configurations

       To   return  a  specific  number  of  launch  configurations,  use  the
       --max-items option.

          aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations \
              --max-items 1

       If the output includes a NextToken field, there are more launch config-
       urations. To get the additional launch configurations, use the value of
       this field with the --starting-token option in  a  subsequent  call  as
       follows.

          aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations \
              --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

                        You  can  specify  either VirtualName or Ebs , but not
                        both.

                     DeviceName -> (string)
                        The device name exposed to the EC2 instance (for exam-
                        ple,  /dev/sdh  or  xvdh  ). For more information, see

                        User Guide for Linux Instances .

                     Ebs -> (structure)
                        Parameters  used  to  automatically set up EBS volumes
                        when an instance is launched.

                        You can specify either VirtualName or Ebs  ,  but  not
                        both.

                        SnapshotId -> (string)
                            The snapshot ID of the volume to use.

                            You  must  specify  either a VolumeSize or a Snap-
                            shotId .

                        VolumeSize -> (integer)
                            The volume size, in GiBs. The  following  are  the
                            supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

                            o gp2 and gp3 : 1-16,384

                            o io1 : 4-16,384

                            o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                            o standard : 1-1,024

                            You  must specify either a SnapshotId or a Volume-
                            Size . If you specify both SnapshotId and  Volume-
                            Size  ,  the  volume size must be equal or greater
                            than the size of the snapshot.

                        VolumeType -> (string)
                            The volume type. For more information, see  Amazon
                            EBS  volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for
                            Linux Instances .

                            Valid Values: standard | io1 | gp2 | st1 |  sc1  |
                            gp3

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                            Indicates   whether   the  volume  is  deleted  on
                            instance termination. For Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling,
                            the default value is true .

                        Iops -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  input/output (I/O) operations per
                            second (IOPS) to provision for the volume. For gp3
                            and  io1  volumes,  this  represents the number of
                            IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For  gp2
                            volumes,  this represents the baseline performance
                            of the volume and the rate  at  which  the  volume
                            accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                            The  following  are  the supported values for each
                            volume type:

                            o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                            o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                            For io1 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for
                            Instances  built  on  the  Nitro  System  .  Other
                            instance  families  guarantee  performance  up  to
                            32,000 IOPS.
                               Iops  is  supported when the volume type is gp3
                               or io1 and required only when the  volume  type
                               is  io1 . (Not used with standard , gp2 , st1 ,
                               or sc1 volumes.)

                        Encrypted -> (boolean)
                            Specifies whether the volume should be  encrypted.
                            Encrypted  EBS  volumes  can  only  be attached to
                            instances that support Amazon EBS encryption.  For
                            more  information,  see Supported instance types .
                            If your AMI uses encrypted volumes, you  can  also
                            only launch it on supported instance types.

                            NOTE:
                               If  you  are creating a volume from a snapshot,
                               you cannot create an unencrypted volume from an
                               encrypted  snapshot. Also, you cannot specify a
                               KMS key ID when using a launch configuration.

                               If you enable encryption by  default,  the  EBS
                               volumes  that  you create are always encrypted,
                               either using the Amazon  Web  Services  managed
                               KMS  key or a customer-managed KMS key, regard-
                               less of whether the snapshot was encrypted.

                               For more information, see Using Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices KMS keys to encrypt Amazon EBS volumes in
                               the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                        Throughput -> (integer)
                            The throughput (MiBps) to provision for a gp3 vol-
                            ume.

                     NoDevice -> (boolean)
                        Setting  this  value  to true suppresses the specified
                        device included in the block  device  mapping  of  the
                        AMI.

                        If  NoDevice  is  true  for the root device, instances
                        might fail the EC2 health check. In that case,  Amazon
                        EC2 Auto Scaling launches replacement instances.

                        If you specify NoDevice , you cannot specify Ebs .

              InstanceMonitoring -> (structure)
                 Controls  whether  instances  in this group are launched with
                 detailed (true ) or basic (false ) monitoring.

                 For more information, see Configure Monitoring for Auto Scal-
                 ing Instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     If  true  ,  detailed  monitoring  is enabled. Otherwise,
                     basic monitoring is enabled.

              SpotPrice -> (string)
                 The maximum hourly price to be paid  for  any  Spot  Instance
                 launched  to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched
                 when the price you specify exceeds the  current  Spot  price.
                 For  more  information,  see Requesting Spot Instances in the
                 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

              IamInstanceProfile -> (string)
                 The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  instance
                 profile  associated  with  the IAM role for the instance. The
                 instance profile contains the IAM role. For more information,
                 see  IAM  role  for  applications  that  run  on  Amazon  EC2
                 instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date and time for the launch configuration.

              EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the launch configuration is  optimized  for
                 EBS  I/O  (true  ) or not (false ). For more information, see
                 Amazon EBS-Optimized Instances in the Amazon EC2  User  Guide
                 for Linux Instances .

              AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                 For  Auto Scaling groups that are running in a VPC, specifies
                 whether  to  assign  a  public  IP  address  to  the  group's
                 instances.  For  more information, see Launching Auto Scaling
                 instances in a VPC in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User  Guide
                 .

              PlacementTenancy -> (string)
                 The tenancy of the instance, either default or dedicated . An
                 instance with dedicated tenancy runs on isolated, single-ten-
                 ant hardware and can only be launched into a VPC.

                 For  more  information, see Configuring instance tenancy with
                 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto  Scaling  User
                 Guide .

              MetadataOptions -> (structure)
                 The metadata options for the instances. For more information,
                 see Configuring the Instance Metadata Options in  the  Amazon
                 EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                 HttpTokens -> (string)
                     The  state  of  token  usage  for  your instance metadata
                     requests. If  the  parameter  is  not  specified  in  the
                     request, the default state is optional .

                     If  the  state  is  optional , you can choose to retrieve
                     instance metadata with or without a signed  token  header
                     on your request. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials
                     without a token, the version  1.0  role  credentials  are
                     returned.  If you retrieve the IAM role credentials using
                     a valid signed token, the version  2.0  role  credentials
                     are returned.

                     If  the  state is required , you must send a signed token
                     header with any instance metadata retrieval requests.  In
                     this  state,  retrieving  the IAM role credentials always
                     returns the version 2.0 credentials; the version 1.0 cre-
                     dentials are not available.

                 HttpPutResponseHopLimit -> (integer)
                     The  desired  HTTP  PUT  response  hop limit for instance
                     metadata requests. The larger  the  number,  the  further
                     instance metadata requests can travel.

                     Default: 1

                 HttpEndpoint -> (string)
                     This parameter enables or disables the HTTP metadata end-
                     point on your instances. If the parameter is  not  speci-
                     fied, the default state is enabled .

                     NOTE:
                        If  you  specify a value of disabled , you will not be
                        able to access your instance metadata.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A string that indicates that the response contains more  items  than
          can  be  returned in a single response. To receive additional items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set  of  items.  This  value is null when there are no more items to
          return.
