TERMINATE-INSTANCE-IN-AUTO-SCALING-GTERMINATE-INSTANCE-IN-AUTO-SCALING-GROUP()



NAME
       terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Terminates  the  specified  instance and optionally adjusts the desired
       group size. This operation cannot be called  on  instances  in  a  warm
       pool.

       This  call simply makes a termination request. The instance is not ter-
       minated immediately. When an instance is terminated, the instance  sta-
       tus  changes  to terminated . You can't connect to or start an instance
       after you've terminated it.

       If you do not specify the option to  decrement  the  desired  capacity,
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are
       terminated.

       By default, Amazon EC2  Auto  Scaling  balances  instances  across  all
       Availability  Zones.  If  you decrement the desired capacity, your Auto
       Scaling group can become unbalanced between Availability Zones.  Amazon
       EC2  Auto  Scaling  tries to rebalance the group, and rebalancing might
       terminate  instances  in  other  zones.  For  more   information,   see
       Rebalancing activities in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group
          --instance-id <value>
          --should-decrement-desired-capacity | --no-should-decrement-desired-capacity
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --should-decrement-desired-capacity         |        --no-should-decre-
       ment-desired-capacity (boolean)
          Indicates whether terminating the instance also decrements the  size
          of the Auto Scaling group.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To terminate an instance in an Auto Scaling group

       This  example terminates the specified instance from the specified Auto
       Scaling group without updating the size of the group. Amazon  EC2  Auto
       Scaling  launches  a  replacement instance after the specified instance
       terminates.

          aws autoscaling terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group \
              --instance-id i-061c63c5eb45f0416 \
              --no-should-decrement-desired-capacity

       Output:
