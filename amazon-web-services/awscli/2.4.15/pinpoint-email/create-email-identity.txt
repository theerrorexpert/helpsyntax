CREATE-EMAIL-IDENTITY()                                CREATE-EMAIL-IDENTITY()



NAME
       create-email-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Verifies an email identity for use with Amazon Pinpoint. In Amazon Pin-
       point, an identity is an email address or domain that you use when  you
       send  email.  Before  you can use an identity to send email with Amazon
       Pinpoint, you first have to verify it. By  verifying  an  address,  you
       demonstrate that you're the owner of the address, and that you've given
       Amazon Pinpoint permission to send email from the address.

       When you verify an email address, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email to the
       address.  Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link
       in the verification email.

       When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens,
       which  you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to
       the DNS configuration for your domain. Your  domain  is  verified  when
       Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your
       domain. It usually takes around 72 hours to complete the domain verifi-
       cation process.

SYNOPSIS
            create-email-identity
          --email-identity <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email address or domain that you want to verify.

       --tags (list)
          An  array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that you
          want to associate with the email identity.

          (structure)
              An object that defines the  tags  that  are  associated  with  a
              resource.  A tag is a label that you optionally define and asso-
              ciate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you cat-
              egorize  and manage resources in different ways, such as by pur-
              pose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have
              as many as 50 tags.

              Each  tag  consists  of a required tag key and an associated tag
              value , both of which you define. A tag key is a  general  label
              that  acts  as  a  category for a more specific tag value. A tag
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can  con-
              tain  as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many
              as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode  letters,  dig-
              its,  white  space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique  and
                it can have only one value.

              o The aws: prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you cant use it in
                any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't
                edit  or  remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags
                that use this prefix dont count against the limit of  50  tags
                per resource.

              o You  can  associate  tags with public or shared resources, but
                the tags are available only for  your  AWS  account,  not  any
                other  accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags
                are available only for resources that are located in the spec-
                ified AWS Region for your AWS account.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum
                 length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length  is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The  minimum
                 length is 0 characters. If you dont want a resource to have a
                 specific tag value, dont specify a value for this  parameter.
                 Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityType -> (string)
          The email identity type.

       VerifiedForSendingStatus -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  or  not the identity is verified. In Amazon Pin-
          point, you can only send email  from  verified  email  addresses  or
          domains.  For  more  information about verifying identities, see the
          Amazon Pinpoint User Guide .

       DkimAttributes -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about the  DKIM  attributes  for
          the identity. This object includes the tokens that you use to create
          the CNAME records that are required to complete the  DKIM  verifica-
          tion process.

          SigningEnabled -> (boolean)
              If  the  value  is true , then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint
              sends from the identity are DKIM-signed. If the value is false ,
              then  the  messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from the identity
              aren't DKIM-signed.

          Status -> (string)
              Describes  whether  or  not  Amazon  Pinpoint  has  successfully
              located  the DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The
              status can be one of the following:

              o PENDING  Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet located the  DKIM  records
                in  the DNS configuration for the domain, but will continue to
                attempt to locate them.

              o SUCCESS  Amazon Pinpoint located the DKIM records in  the  DNS
                configuration  for the domain and determined that they're cor-
                rect. Amazon Pinpoint can now send DKIM-signed email from  the
                identity.

              o FAILED   Amazon Pinpoint was unable to locate the DKIM records
                in the DNS settings for the  domain,  and  won't  continue  to
                search for them.

              o TEMPORARY_FAILURE  A temporary issue occurred, which prevented
                Amazon Pinpoint from  determining  the  DKIM  status  for  the
                domain.

              o NOT_STARTED   Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet started searching for
                the DKIM records in the DKIM records for the domain.

          Tokens -> (list)
              A set of unique strings that you use to create a  set  of  CNAME
              records  that  you add to the DNS configuration for your domain.
              When Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configura-
              tion  for  your  domain, the DKIM authentication process is com-
              plete. Amazon Pinpoint  usually  detects  these  records  within
              about  72 hours of adding them to the DNS configuration for your
              domain.
