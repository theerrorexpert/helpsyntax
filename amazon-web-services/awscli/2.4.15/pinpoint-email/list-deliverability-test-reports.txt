NAME
       list-deliverability-test-reports -

DESCRIPTION
       Show  a  list  of the predictive inbox placement tests that you've per-
       formed, regardless of their statuses. For  predictive  inbox  placement
       tests  that  are  complete, you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport
       operation to view the results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-deliverability-test-reports is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DeliverabilityTestReports

SYNOPSIS
            list-deliverability-test-reports
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DeliverabilityTestReports -> (list)
          An object that contains a lists of predictive inbox placement  tests
          that you've performed.

          (structure)
              An  object  that contains metadata related to a predictive inbox
              placement test.

              ReportId -> (string)
                 A unique string that identifies the predictive  inbox  place-
                 ment test.

              ReportName -> (string)
                 A  name  that helps you identify a predictive inbox placement
                 test report.

              Subject -> (string)
                 The subject line for an email that you submitted in a predic-
                 tive inbox placement test.

              FromEmailAddress -> (string)
                 The  sender  address  that  you  specified for the predictive
                 inbox placement test.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the predictive  inbox  placement  test
                 was created, in Unix time format.

              DeliverabilityTestStatus -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the  predictive inbox placement test. If the
                 status is IN_PROGRESS , then the predictive  inbox  placement
                 test  is  currently running. Predictive inbox placement tests
                 are usually complete within 24 hours of creating the test. If
                 the  status  is COMPLETE , then the test is finished, and you
                 can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport to view  the  results
                 of the test.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates that there are additional predictive inbox
          placement tests to list. To view additional predictive inbox  place-
          ment tests, issue another request to ListDeliverabilityTestReports ,
          and pass this token in the NextToken parameter.
