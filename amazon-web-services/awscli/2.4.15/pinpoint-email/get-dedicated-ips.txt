GET-DEDICATED-IPS()                                        GET-DEDICATED-IPS()



NAME
       get-dedicated-ips -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  dedicated  IP addresses that are associated with your Amazon
       Pinpoint account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-dedicated-ips is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DedicatedIps

SYNOPSIS
            get-dedicated-ips
          [--pool-name <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pool-name (string)
          The  name of the IP pool that the dedicated IP address is associated
          with.

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DedicatedIps -> (list)
          A  list  of dedicated IP addresses that are reserved for use by your
          Amazon Pinpoint account.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a dedicated IP address that is  asso-
              ciated with your Amazon Pinpoint account.

              Ip -> (string)
                 An  IP  address  that is reserved for use by your Amazon Pin-
                 point account.

              WarmupStatus -> (string)
                 The warm-up status of a dedicated IP address. The status  can
                 have one of the following values:

                 o IN_PROGRESS   The IP address isn't ready to use because the
                   dedicated IP warm-up process is ongoing.

                 o DONE  The dedicated IP warm-up process is complete, and the
                   IP address is ready to use.

              WarmupPercentage -> (integer)
                 Indicates  how  complete the dedicated IP warm-up process is.
                 When this value equals  1,  the  address  has  completed  the
                 warm-up process and is ready for use.

              PoolName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  dedicated  IP pool that the IP address is
                 associated with.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that  indicates  that  there  are  additional  dedicated  IP
          addresses  to  list.  To  view  additional  addresses, issue another
          request to GetDedicatedIps , passing this  token  in  the  NextToken
          parameter.



                                                           GET-DEDICATED-IPS()
