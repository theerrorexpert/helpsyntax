GET-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESTINATGET-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESTINATIONS()



NAME
       get-configuration-set-event-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  a  list of event destinations that are associated with a con-
       figuration set.

       In Amazon Pinpoint, events include message  sends,  deliveries,  opens,
       clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are places that you
       can send information about these events to. For example, you  can  send
       event  data  to  Amazon  SNS  to receive notifications when you receive
       bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data  Firehose  to
       stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-configuration-set-event-destinations
          --configuration-set-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name  of the configuration set that contains the event destina-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventDestinations -> (list)
          An array that includes all of the events destinations that have been
          configured for the configuration set.

          (structure)
              In  Amazon  Pinpoint,  events include message sends, deliveries,
              opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event  destinations  are
              places  that you can send information about these events to. For
              example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive  noti-
              fications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use
              Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data  to  Amazon  S3  for
              long-term storage.

              Name -> (string)
                 A name that identifies the event destination.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 If  true  ,  the event destination is enabled. When the event
                 destination is enabled, the specified event types are sent to
                 the destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

                 If  false , the event destination is disabled. When the event
                 destination is disabled, events aren't sent to the  specified
                 destinations.

              MatchingEventTypes -> (list)
                 The  types of events that Amazon Pinpoint sends to the speci-
                 fied event destinations.

                 (string)
                     An email sending event type. For  example,  email  sends,
                     opens, and bounces are all email events.

                 An object that defines an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose desti-
                 nation for email events. You  can  use  Amazon  Kinesis  Data
                 Firehose  to stream data to other services, such as Amazon S3
                 and Amazon Redshift.

                 IamRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  Ama-
                     zon Pinpoint uses when sending email events to the Amazon

                 DeliveryStreamArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Kinesis Data
                     Firehose  stream  that Amazon Pinpoint sends email events
                     to.

                 An object that defines an Amazon CloudWatch  destination  for
                 email  events.  You  can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and

                 DimensionConfigurations -> (list)
                     An array of objects that define  the  dimensions  to  use
                     when you send email events to Amazon CloudWatch.

                     (structure)
                        An  object that defines the dimension configuration to
                        use when you send Amazon Pinpoint email events to Ama-
                        zon CloudWatch.

                            that   you  specify  using  an  X-SES-MESSAGE-TAGS
                            header or a parameter to  the  SendEmail/SendRawE-
