GET-EMAIL-IDENTITY()                                      GET-EMAIL-IDENTITY()



NAME
       get-email-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  about  a  specific identity associated with your
       Amazon Pinpoint account, including the identity's verification  status,
       its DKIM authentication status, and its custom Mail-From settings.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-email-identity
          --email-identity <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email identity that you want to retrieve details for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityType -> (string)
          The email identity type.

       FeedbackForwardingStatus -> (boolean)
          The feedback forwarding configuration for the identity.

          If the value is true , Amazon Pinpoint sends you email notifications
          when bounce or complaint events occur. Amazon  Pinpoint  sends  this
          notification  to  the  address that you specified in the Return-Path
          header of the original email.

          When you set this value to false , Amazon Pinpoint  sends  notifica-
          tions  through  other mechanisms, such as by notifying an Amazon SNS
          topic or another event destination. You're required to have a method
          of  tracking  bounces  and complaints. If you haven't set up another
          mechanism for receiving bounce or  complaint  notifications,  Amazon
          Pinpoint  sends  an email notification when these events occur (even
          if this setting is disabled).

       VerifiedForSendingStatus -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether or not the identity is verified.  In  Amazon  Pin-
          point,  you  can  only  send  email from verified email addresses or
          domains. For more information about verifying  identities,  see  the
          Amazon Pinpoint User Guide .

       DkimAttributes -> (structure)
          An  object  that  contains information about the DKIM attributes for
          the identity. This object includes the tokens that you use to create
          the  CNAME  records that are required to complete the DKIM verifica-
          tion process.

          SigningEnabled -> (boolean)
              If the value is true , then the messages  that  Amazon  Pinpoint
              sends from the identity are DKIM-signed. If the value is false ,
              then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from  the  identity
              aren't DKIM-signed.

          Status -> (string)
              Describes  whether  or  not  Amazon  Pinpoint  has  successfully
              located the DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain.  The
              status can be one of the following:

              o PENDING   Amazon  Pinpoint hasn't yet located the DKIM records
                in the DNS configuration for the domain, but will continue  to
                attempt to locate them.

              o SUCCESS   Amazon  Pinpoint located the DKIM records in the DNS
                configuration for the domain and determined that they're  cor-
                rect.  Amazon Pinpoint can now send DKIM-signed email from the
                identity.

              o FAILED  Amazon Pinpoint was unable to locate the DKIM  records
                in  the  DNS  settings  for  the domain, and won't continue to
                search for them.

              o TEMPORARY_FAILURE  A temporary issue occurred, which prevented
                Amazon  Pinpoint  from  determining  the  DKIM  status for the
                domain.

              o NOT_STARTED  Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet started searching  for
                the DKIM records in the DKIM records for the domain.

          Tokens -> (list)
              A  set  of  unique strings that you use to create a set of CNAME
              records that you add to the DNS configuration for  your  domain.
              When Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configura-
              tion for your domain, the DKIM authentication  process  is  com-
              plete.  Amazon  Pinpoint  usually  detects  these records within
              about 72 hours of adding them to the DNS configuration for  your
              domain.

              (string)

       MailFromAttributes -> (structure)
          An  object  that contains information about the Mail-From attributes
          for the email identity.

          MailFromDomain -> (string)
              The name of a domain that an email identity  uses  as  a  custom
              MAIL FROM domain.

          MailFromDomainStatus -> (string)
              The  status  of  the  MAIL FROM domain. This status can have the
              following values:

              o PENDING  Amazon Pinpoint hasn't started searching for  the  MX
                record yet.

              o SUCCESS   Amazon  Pinpoint detected the required MX record for
                the MAIL FROM domain.

              o FAILED  Amazon Pinpoint can't find the required MX record,  or
                the record no longer exists.

              o TEMPORARY_FAILURE  A temporary issue occurred, which prevented
                Amazon Pinpoint from determining the status of the  MAIL  FROM
                domain.

          BehaviorOnMxFailure -> (string)
              The  action  that  Amazon Pinpoint to takes if it can't read the
              required MX record for a custom MAIL FROM domain. When  you  set
              this  value  to  UseDefaultValue  ,  Amazon  Pinpoint  uses ama-
              zonses.com as the MAIL FROM domain. When you set this  value  to
              RejectMessage , Amazon Pinpoint returns a MailFromDomainNotVeri-
              fied error, and doesn't attempt to deliver the email.

              These behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain  con-
              figuration  is  in  the  Pending , Failed , and TemporaryFailure
              states.

       Tags -> (list)
          An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that  are
          associated with the email identity.

          (structure)
              An  object  that  defines  the  tags  that are associated with a
              resource. A tag is a label that you optionally define and  asso-
              ciate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you cat-
              egorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by  pur-
              pose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have
              as many as 50 tags.

              Each tag consists of a required tag key and  an  associated  tag
              value  ,  both of which you define. A tag key is a general label
              that acts as a category for a more specific  tag  value.  A  tag
              value  acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can con-
              tain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as  many
              as  256  characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, dig-
              its, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : /  =  +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For  each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and
                it can have only one value.

              o The aws: prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you cant use it in
                any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't
                edit or remove tag keys or values that use this  prefix.  Tags
                that  use  this prefix dont count against the limit of 50 tags
                per resource.

              o You can associate tags with public or  shared  resources,  but
                the  tags  are  available  only  for your AWS account, not any
                other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the  tags
                are available only for resources that are located in the spec-
                ified AWS Region for your AWS account.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The  maximum
                 length  of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum  length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum
                 length is 0 characters. If you dont want a resource to have a
                 specific  tag value, dont specify a value for this parameter.
                 Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.
