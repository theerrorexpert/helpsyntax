DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  information  about the status of the Deliverability dashboard
       for your Amazon Pinpoint account. When the Deliverability dashboard  is
       enabled,  you gain access to reputation, deliverability, and other met-
       rics for the domains that you use to send email using Amazon  Pinpoint.
       You  also gain the ability to perform predictive inbox placement tests.

       When you use the Deliverability dashboard, you pay a monthly  subscrip-
       tion  charge,  in  addition  to any other fees that you accrue by using
       Amazon Pinpoint. For more information about the features and cost of  a
       Deliverability dashboard subscription, see Amazon Pinpoint Pricing .

SYNOPSIS
            get-deliverability-dashboard-options
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
