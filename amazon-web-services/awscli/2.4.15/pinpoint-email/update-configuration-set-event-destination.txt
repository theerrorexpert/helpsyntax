UPDATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESUPDATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       update-configuration-set-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Update  the  configuration  of an event destination for a configuration
       set.

       In Amazon Pinpoint, events include message  sends,  deliveries,  opens,
       clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are places that you
       can send information about these events to. For example, you  can  send
       event  data  to  Amazon  SNS  to receive notifications when you receive
       bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data  Firehose  to
       stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          --configuration-set-name <value>
          --event-destination-name <value>
          --event-destination <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name  of the configuration set that contains the event destina-
          tion that you want to modify.

       --event-destination-name (string)
          The name of the event destination that you want to modify.

       --event-destination (structure)
          An object that defines the event destination.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              If true , the event destination is enabled. When the event  des-
              tination  is  enabled, the specified event types are sent to the
              destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

              If false , the event destination is  disabled.  When  the  event
              destination  is  disabled,  events  aren't sent to the specified
              destinations.

          MatchingEventTypes -> (list)
              An array that specifies which events Amazon Pinpoint should send
              to the destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

              (string)
                 An email sending event type. For example, email sends, opens,
                 and bounces are all email events.

          KinesisFirehoseDestination -> (structure)
              An object that defines an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose  destina-
              tion  for email events. You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
              to stream data to other services, such as Amazon S3  and  Amazon
              Redshift.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Amazon
                 Pinpoint uses when sending email events to the Amazon Kinesis
                 Data Firehose stream.

              DeliveryStreamArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Amazon Kinesis Data
                 Firehose stream that Amazon Pinpoint sends email events to.

          CloudWatchDestination -> (structure)
              An object that defines  an  Amazon  CloudWatch  destination  for
              email  events. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and gain
              insights on your email sending metrics.

              DimensionConfigurations -> (list)
                 An array of objects that define the dimensions  to  use  when
                 you send email events to Amazon CloudWatch.

                 (structure)
                     An object that defines the dimension configuration to use
                     when you send Amazon  Pinpoint  email  events  to  Amazon
                     CloudWatch.

                     DimensionName -> (string)
                        The  name of an Amazon CloudWatch dimension associated
                        with an email sending metric. The name has to meet the
                        following criteria:

                        o It  can  only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), num-
                          bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                        o It can contain no more than 256 characters.

                     DimensionValueSource -> (string)
                        The location where Amazon Pinpoint finds the value  of
                        a  dimension  to  publish to Amazon CloudWatch. If you
                        want Amazon Pinpoint to use the message tags that  you
                        specify using an X-SES-MESSAGE-TAGS header or a param-
                        eter to the SendEmail/SendRawEmail  API,  choose  mes-
                        sageTag  . If you want Amazon Pinpoint to use your own
                        email headers, choose emailHeader . If you want Amazon
                        Pinpoint to use link tags, choose linkTags .

                     DefaultDimensionValue -> (string)
                        The  default  value of the dimension that is published
                        to Amazon CloudWatch if you don't provide the value of
                        the  dimension  when you send an email. This value has
                        to meet the following criteria:

                        o It can only contain ASCII letters (a-z,  A-Z),  num-

          SnsDestination -> (structure)
              An  object  that  defines  an  Amazon  SNS destination for email
              events. You can use Amazon SNS to send notification when certain
              email events occur.

              TopicArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic that
                 you want to publish email events  to.  For  more  information

              create segments for your campaigns.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Pinpoint project

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
