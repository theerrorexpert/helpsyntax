NAME
       put-email-identity-mail-from-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Used to enable or disable the custom Mail-From domain configuration for
       an email identity.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-email-identity-mail-from-attributes
          --email-identity <value>
          [--mail-from-domain <value>]
          [--behavior-on-mx-failure <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The verified email identity that you want to set up the custom  MAIL
          FROM domain for.

       --mail-from-domain (string)
          The  custom  MAIL FROM domain that you want the verified identity to
          use. The MAIL FROM domain must meet the following criteria:

          o It has to be a subdomain of the verified identity.

          o It can't be used to receive email.

          o It can't be used in a "From" address if the MAIL FROM domain is  a
            destination for feedback forwarding emails.

       --behavior-on-mx-failure (string)
          The  action  that  you want Amazon Pinpoint to take if it can't read
          the required MX record when you send an email.  When  you  set  this
          value to UseDefaultValue , Amazon Pinpoint uses amazonses.com as the
          MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to RejectMessage ,  Amazon
          Pinpoint  returns  a  MailFromDomainNotVerified  error,  and doesn't
          attempt to deliver the email.

          These behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain  configu-
          ration is in the Pending , Failed , and TemporaryFailure states.

          Possible values:

          o USE_DEFAULT_VALUE

          o REJECT_MESSAGE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
