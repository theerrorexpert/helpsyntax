LIST-SITES()                                                      LIST-SITES()



NAME
       list-sites -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the sites for your Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-sites
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum page size.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list sites

       The  following  list-sites example lists the available Outpost sites in
       your AWS account.

          aws outposts list-sites

       Output:

          {
              "Sites": [
                  {
                      "SiteId": "os-0ab12c3456EXAMPLE",
                      "AccountId": "123456789012",
                      "Name": "EXAMPLE",
                      "Description": "example",
                      "Tags": {}
                  }
              ]
          }
