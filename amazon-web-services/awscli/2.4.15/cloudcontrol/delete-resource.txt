DELETE-RESOURCE()                                            DELETE-RESOURCE()



NAME
       delete-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified resource. For details, see Deleting a resource in
       the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       After you have initiated a resource deletion request, you  can  monitor
       the  progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus using
       the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent returned by DeleteResource .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-resource
          --type-name <value>
          [--type-version-id <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The name of the resource type.

       --type-version-id (string)
          For private resource types, the type version to use in this resource
          operation.  If you do not specify a resource version, CloudFormation
          uses the default version.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM)  for  Cloud  Control  API to use when performing this resource
          operation. The role specified must have the permissions required for
          this operation. The necessary permissions for each event handler are
          defined in the `` handlers `` section of the resource  type  defini-
          tion schema .

          If  you  do  not  specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary
          session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

          For more information, see Specifying credentials in the  Amazon  Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier  to  ensure  the  idempotency  of the resource
          request. As a best practice, specify this token  to  ensure  idempo-
          tency,  so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately
          distinguish between request retries and new resource  requests.  You
          might  retry  a  resource request to ensure that it was successfully
          received.

          A client token is valid for  36  hours  once  used.  After  that,  a
          resource  request  with  the  same  client token is treated as a new
          request.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion
          in the request.

          For  more  information, see Ensuring resource operation requests are
          unique in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --identifier (string)
          The identifier for the resource.

          You can specify the primary identifier, or any secondary  identifier
          defined  for  the resource type in its resource schema. You can only
          specify one identifier. Primary identifiers can be  specified  as  a
          string or JSON; secondary identifiers must be specified as JSON.

          For compound primary identifiers (that is, one that consists of mul-
          tiple resource properties strung together), to specify  the  primary
          identifier  as  a string, list the property values in the order they
          are specified in the primary identifier definition, separated by | .

          For  more  information,  see Identifying resources in the Amazon Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a resource

       The following delete-resource example  deletes  a  AWS::Kinesis::Stream
       resource with the identifier ResourceExample from your AWS account.

          aws cloudcontrol delete-resource \
              --type-name AWS::Kinesis::Stream \
              --identifier ResourceExample

       Output:

          {
              "ProgressEvent": {
                  "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                  "Identifier": "ResourceExample",
                  "RequestToken": "e48f26ff-d0f9-4ab8-a878-120db1edf111",
                  "Operation": "DELETE",
                  "OperationStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "EventTime": 1632950300.14
              }
          }

       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ProgressEvent -> (structure)
          Represents the current status of the resource deletion request.

          After you have initiated a resource deletion request, you can  moni-
          tor the progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus
          using the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent  returned  by  DeleteRe-
          source .

          TypeName -> (string)
              The name of the resource type used in the operation.

          Identifier -> (string)
              The primary identifier for the resource.

              NOTE:
                 In  some  cases,  the  resource  identifier  may be available
                 before the resource operation has reached a status of SUCCESS
                 .

          RequestToken -> (string)
              The unique token representing this resource operation request.

              Use the RequestToken with GetResourceRequestStatus to return the
              current status of a resource operation request.

          Operation -> (string)
              The resource operation type.

          OperationStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the resource operation request.

              o PENDING : The resource operation has not yet started.

              o IN_PROGRESS : The resource operation is currently in progress.

              o SUCCESS : The resource operation has successfully completed.

              o FAILED : The resource operation has failed. Refer to the error
                code and status message for more information.

              o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS : The resource operation is in the  process
                of being canceled.

              o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The resource operation has been canceled.

          EventTime -> (timestamp)
              When the resource operation request was initiated.

          ResourceModel -> (string)
              A  JSON string containing the resource model, consisting of each
              resource property and its current value.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Any message explaining the current status.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              For requests with a status of  FAILED  ,  the  associated  error
              code.

              For  error  code  definitions,  see  Handler  error codes in the
              CloudFormation Command Line Interface User Guide  for  Extension
              Development .

          RetryAfter -> (timestamp)
              When  to  next  request  the  status  of this resource operation
              request.
