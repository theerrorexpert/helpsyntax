NAME
       list-resource-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns existing resource operation requests. This includes requests of
       all status types. For more information,  see  Listing  active  resource
       operation  requests  in  the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          Resource operation requests expire after seven days.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-resource-requests
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--resource-request-status-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call.  If
          the  number  of available results exceeds this maximum, the response
          includes a NextToken value that you  can  assign  to  the  NextToken
          request parameter to get the next set of results.

          The default is 20 .

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining
          results, the response object's NextToken parameter value is set to a
          token.  To  retrieve the next set of results, call this action again
          and assign that token to the request object's  NextToken  parameter.
          If  there  are  no remaining results, the previous response object's
          NextToken parameter is set to null .

       --resource-request-status-filter (structure)
          The filter criteria to apply to the requests returned.

          Operations -> (list)
              The operation types to include in the filter.

              (string)

          OperationStatuses -> (list)
              The operation statuses to include in the filter.

              o PENDING : The operation has been requested, but not yet initi-
                ated.

              o IN_PROGRESS : The operation is currently in progress.

              o SUCCESS : The operation has successfully completed.

              o FAILED : The operation has failed.

              o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS : The operation is currently in the process
                of being canceled.

              o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The operation has been canceled.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operations=string,string,OperationStatuses=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Operations": ["CREATE"|"DELETE"|"UPDATE", ...],
            "OperationStatuses": ["PENDING"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"SUCCESS"|"FAILED"|"CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS"|"CANCEL_COMPLETE", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the active resource operation requests

       The  following  list-resource-requests  example  lists   the   resource
       requests  for CREATE and UPDATE operations that have failed in your AWS
       account.

          aws cloudcontrol list-resource-requests \
              --resource-request-status-filter Operations=CREATE,OperationStatuses=FAILED

       Output:

          {
              "ResourceRequestStatusSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                      "Identifier": "Demo",
                      "RequestToken": "e1a6b86e-46bd-41ac-bfba-633abcdfdbd7",
                      "Operation": "CREATE",
                      "OperationStatus": "FAILED",
                      "EventTime": 1632950268.481,
                      "StatusMessage": "Resource of type 'AWS::Kinesis::Stream' with identifier 'Demo' already exists.",
                      "ErrorCode": "AlreadyExists"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ResourceRequestStatusSummaries -> (list)
          The requests that match the specified filter criteria.

          (structure)
              Represents  the  current status of a resource operation request.
              For more information, see Managing resource  operation  requests
              in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

              TypeName -> (string)

                 NOTE:
                     In  some  cases, the resource identifier may be available
                     before the resource operation has  reached  a  status  of
                     SUCCESS .

              RequestToken -> (string)
                 The   unique   token  representing  this  resource  operation
                 request.

                 Use the RequestToken with GetResourceRequestStatus to  return
                 the current status of a resource operation request.

                   pleted.

                 o FAILED  :  The  resource operation has failed. Refer to the
                   error code and status message for more information.

                 o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS :  The  resource  operation  is  in  the
                   process of being canceled.

                 o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The resource operation has been canceled.

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the resource operation request was initiated.

              ResourceModel -> (string)
                 A JSON string containing the resource  model,  consisting  of
                 each resource property and its current value.

              RetryAfter -> (timestamp)
                 When to next request the status of  this  resource  operation
                 request.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the request doesn't return all of the remaining results, NextTo-
          ken is set to a token. To retrieve the next  set  of  results,  call
          ListResources  again  and  assign that token to the request object's
          NextToken parameter. If the request returns all  results,  NextToken
          is set to null.
