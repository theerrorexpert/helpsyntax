CREATE-RESOURCE()                                            CREATE-RESOURCE()



NAME
       create-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  the  specified  resource. For more information, see Creating a
       resource in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       After you have initiated a resource creation request, you  can  monitor
       the  progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus using
       the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent type returned by CreateResource .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-resource
          --type-name <value>
          [--type-version-id <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --desired-state <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The name of the resource type.

       --type-version-id (string)
          For private resource types, the type version to use in this resource
          operation. If you do not specify a resource version,  CloudFormation
          uses the default version.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) for Cloud Control API to use  when  performing  this  resource
          operation. The role specified must have the permissions required for
          this operation. The necessary permissions for each event handler are
          defined  in  the `` handlers `` section of the resource type defini-
          tion schema .

          If you do not specify a role, Cloud Control  API  uses  a  temporary
          session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

          For  more  information, see Specifying credentials in the Amazon Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --client-token (string)
          A unique identifier  to  ensure  the  idempotency  of  the  resource
          request.  As  a  best practice, specify this token to ensure idempo-
          tency, so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can  accurately
          distinguish  between  request retries and new resource requests. You
          might retry a resource request to ensure that  it  was  successfully
          received.

          A  client  token  is  valid  for  36  hours once used. After that, a
          resource request with the same client token  is  treated  as  a  new
          request.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion
          in the request.

          For more information, see Ensuring resource operation  requests  are
          unique in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --desired-state (string)
          Structured  data  format  representing  the  desired  state  of  the
          resource, consisting of that resource's properties and their desired
          values.

          NOTE:
              Cloud  Control  API currently supports JSON as a structured data
              format.

          Specify the desired state as one of the following:

          o A JSON blob

          o A local path containing the desired state in JSON data format

          For more  information,  see  Composing  the  desired  state  of  the
          resource in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

          For  more  information  about the properties of a specific resource,
          refer to the related topic for the  resource  in  the  Resource  and
          property  types  reference in the Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
          Users Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a resource

       The following create-resource example creates  an  AWS::Kinesis::Stream
       resource,  named  ResourceExample, with a retention period of 168 hours
       and a shard count of three.

          aws cloudcontrol create-resource \
              --type-name AWS::Kinesis::Stream \
              --desired-state "{\"Name\": \"ResourceExample\",\"RetentionPeriodHours\":168, \"ShardCount\":3}"

       Output:

          {
              "ProgressEvent": {
                  "EventTime": 1632506656.706,
                  "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                  "OperationStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "Operation": "CREATE",
                  "Identifier": "ResourceExample",
                  "RequestToken": "20999d87-e304-4725-ad84-832dcbfd7fc5"
              }
          }

       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ProgressEvent -> (structure)
          Represents the current status of the resource creation request.

          After  you have initiated a resource creation request, you can moni-
          tor the progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus
          using  the  RequestToken  of the ProgressEvent returned by CreateRe-
          source .

          TypeName -> (string)
              The name of the resource type used in the operation.

          Identifier -> (string)
              The primary identifier for the resource.

              NOTE:
                 In some cases,  the  resource  identifier  may  be  available
                 before the resource operation has reached a status of SUCCESS
                 .

          RequestToken -> (string)
              The unique token representing this resource operation request.

              Use the RequestToken with GetResourceRequestStatus to return the
              current status of a resource operation request.

          Operation -> (string)
              The resource operation type.

          OperationStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the resource operation request.

              o PENDING : The resource operation has not yet started.

              o IN_PROGRESS : The resource operation is currently in progress.

              o SUCCESS : The resource operation has successfully completed.

              o FAILED : The resource operation has failed. Refer to the error
                code and status message for more information.

              o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS  : The resource operation is in the process
                of being canceled.

              o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The resource operation has been canceled.

          EventTime -> (timestamp)
              When the resource operation request was initiated.

          ResourceModel -> (string)
              A JSON string containing the resource model, consisting of  each
              resource property and its current value.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Any message explaining the current status.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              For  requests  with  a  status  of FAILED , the associated error
              code.

              For error code definitions,  see  Handler  error  codes  in  the
              CloudFormation  Command  Line Interface User Guide for Extension
              Development .

          RetryAfter -> (timestamp)
              When to next request  the  status  of  this  resource  operation
              request.
