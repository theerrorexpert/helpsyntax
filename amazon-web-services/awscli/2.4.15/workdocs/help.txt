NAME
       workdocs -

DESCRIPTION
       The WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:

       o File  Migration:  File migration applications are supported for users
         who want to migrate their files from an on-premises  or  off-premises
         file  system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory
         structure, as well as allow for basic metadata changes, such as modi-
         fications to the permissions of files.

       o Security:  Support  security applications are supported for users who
         have additional security needs, such as antivirus or data  loss  pre-
         vention.  The  API  actions,  along  with AWS CloudTrail, allow these
         applications to detect when changes occur in Amazon  WorkDocs.  Then,
         the application can take the necessary actions and replace the target
         file. If the target file violates the  policy,  the  application  can
         also choose to email the user.

       o eDiscovery/Analytics:  General  administrative  applications are sup-
         ported, such as eDiscovery  and  analytics.  These  applications  can
         choose  to  mimic  or  record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site,
         along with AWS CloudTrail, to replicate data for eDiscovery,  backup,
         or analytical applications.

       All  Amazon  WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certifi-
       cate-signed. They not only require the use of the  AWS  SDK,  but  also
       allow  for  the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate
       access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing
       an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full
       administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site  (or  as
       set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the abil-
       ity to modify file permissions and upload any file to  any  user.  This
       allows developers to perform the three use cases above, as well as give
       users the ability to grant access on a selective basis  using  the  IAM
       model.
