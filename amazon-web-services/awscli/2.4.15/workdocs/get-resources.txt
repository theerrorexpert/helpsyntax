SYNOPSIS
            get-resources
          [--authentication-token <value>]
          [--user-id <value>]
          [--collection-type <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authentication-token (string)
          The Amazon WorkDocs authentication token. Not  required  when  using
          AWS administrator credentials to access the API.

       --user-id (string)
          The  user  ID  for the resource collection. This is a required field
          for accessing the API operation using IAM credentials.

       --collection-type (string)
          The collection type.

          Possible values:

          o SHARED_WITH_ME

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of resources to return.

       --marker (string)
          The marker for the next set of results.  This  marker  was  received
          from a previous call.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve shared resources

       The following get-resources example retrieves the resources shared with
       the specified Amazon WorkDocs user.

              --collection-type SHARED_WITH_ME

       Output:
