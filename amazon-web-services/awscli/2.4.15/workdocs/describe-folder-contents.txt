DESCRIBE-FOLDER-CONTENTS()                          DESCRIBE-FOLDER-CONTENTS()



NAME
       describe-folder-contents -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the contents of the specified folder, including its documents
       and subfolders.

       By default, Amazon WorkDocs returns the first 100 active  document  and
       folder metadata items. If there are more results, the response includes
       a marker that you can use to request the next set of results.  You  can
       also request initialized documents.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-folder-contents  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Folders, Documents

SYNOPSIS
            describe-folder-contents
          [--authentication-token <value>]
          --folder-id <value>
          [--sort <value>]
          [--order <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--include <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authentication-token (string)
          Amazon WorkDocs authentication token. Not required  when  using  AWS
          administrator credentials to access the API.

       --folder-id (string)
          The ID of the folder.

       --sort (string)
          The sorting criteria.

          Possible values:

          o DATE

          o NAME

       --order (string)
          The order for the contents of the folder.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --type (string)
          The type of items.

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o DOCUMENT

          o FOLDER

       --include (string)
          The  contents  to include. Specify "INITIALIZED" to include initial-
          ized documents.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
