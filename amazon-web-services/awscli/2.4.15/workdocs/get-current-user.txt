GET-CURRENT-USER()                                          GET-CURRENT-USER()



NAME
       get-current-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves details of the current user for whom the authentication token
       was generated. This is not a valid  action  for  SigV4  (administrative
       API) clients.

       This  action requires an authentication token. To get an authentication
       token, register an application with Amazon WorkDocs. For more  informa-
       tion,  see  Authentication  and Access Control for User Applications in
       the Amazon WorkDocs Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-current-user
          --authentication-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authentication-token (string)
          Amazon WorkDocs authentication token.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
