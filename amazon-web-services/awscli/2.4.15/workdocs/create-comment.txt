            create-comment
          [--authentication-token <value>]
          --document-id <value>

          [--visibility <value>]
          [--notify-collaborators | --no-notify-collaborators]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authentication-token (string)
          Amazon  WorkDocs  authentication  token. Not required when using AWS
          administrator credentials to access the API.

       --document-id (string)
          The ID of the document.

       --version-id (string)
          The ID of the document version.

       --parent-id (string)
          The ID of the parent comment.

       --thread-id (string)
          The ID of the root comment in the thread.

       --text (string)
          The text of the comment.

       --visibility (string)
          The visibility of the comment. Options are either PRIVATE, where the
          comment is visible only to the comment author and document owner and
          co-owners, or PUBLIC, where the comment is visible to document  own-
          ers, co-owners, and contributors.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o PRIVATE

       --notify-collaborators | --no-notify-collaborators (boolean)
          Set this parameter to TRUE to send an email out to the document col-
          laborators after the comment is created.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
