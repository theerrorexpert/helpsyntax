       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "sourceId": "string",
              "sourceName": "string",
              "sourceDescription": "string",
              "sourceSetUpOption": "System_Controls_Mapping"|"Procedural_Controls_Mapping",
              "sourceType": "AWS_Cloudtrail"|"AWS_Config"|"AWS_Security_Hub"|"AWS_API_Call"|"MANUAL",
              "sourceKeyword": {
                "keywordInputType": "SELECT_FROM_LIST",
                "keywordValue": "string"
              },
              "sourceFrequency": "DAILY"|"WEEKLY"|"MONTHLY",
              "troubleshootingText": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
