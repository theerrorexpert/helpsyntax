LIST-CONTROL-DOMAIN-INSIGHTS()                  LIST-CONTROL-DOMAIN-INSIGHTS()



NAME
       list-control-domain-insights -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the latest analytics data for control domains across all of your
       active assessments.

       NOTE:
          A control domain is listed only if at  least  one  of  the  controls
          within  that  domain  collected  evidence on the lastUpdated date of
          controlDomainInsights . If this  condition  isnt  met,  no  data  is
          listed for that control domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-control-domain-insights
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Represents  the  maximum  number  of results on a page or for an API
          request call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       controlDomainInsights -> (list)
          The control domain analytics data that the ListControlDomainInsights
          API returned.

          (structure)
              A  summary  of  the latest analytics data for a specific control
              domain.

              Control domain insights  are  grouped  by  control  domain,  and
              ranked by the highest total count of non-compliant evidence.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the control domain.

              id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the control domain.

              controlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence -> (integer)
                 The  number  of controls in the control domain that collected
                 non-compliant evidence on the lastUpdated date.

              totalControlsCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of controls in the control domain.

              evidenceInsights -> (structure)
                 A breakdown of the compliance check status for  the  evidence
                 thats associated with the control domain.

                 noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of compliance check evidence that Audit Man-
                     ager classified as non-compliant. This includes  evidence
                     that  was collected from Security Hub with a Fail ruling,
                     or collected from Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

                 compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of compliance check evidence that  Audit  Man-
                     ager classified as compliant. This includes evidence that
                     was collected from Security Hub with a  Pass  ruling,  or
                     collected from Config with a Compliant ruling.

                 inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  evidence  that a compliance check ruling
                     isn't available for. Evidence is  inconclusive  when  the
                     associated  control uses Security Hub or Config as a data
                     source but you didn't enable those services. This is also
                     the  case  when  a control uses a data source that doesnt
                     support compliance checks (for example, manual  evidence,
                     API calls, or CloudTrail).

                     NOTE:
                        If  evidence  has  a  compliance  check  status of not
                        applicable in the console, it's classified  as  incon-
                        clusive in EvidenceInsights data.

              lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The  time when the control domain insights were last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
