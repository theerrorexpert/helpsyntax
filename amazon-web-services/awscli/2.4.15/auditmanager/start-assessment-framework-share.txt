NAME
       start-assessment-framework-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a share request for a custom framework in Audit Manager.

       The share request specifies a recipient and notifies them that a custom
       framework is available. Recipients have 120 days to accept  or  decline
       the request. If no action is taken, the share request expires.

       WARNING:
          When you invoke the StartAssessmentFrameworkShare API, you are about
          to share  a  custom  framework  with  another  Amazon  Web  Services
          account. You may not share a custom framework that is derived from a
          standard framework if the standard framework is  designated  as  not
          eligible  for  sharing  by  Amazon  Web  Services,  unless  you have
          obtained permission to do so from the owner of the  standard  frame-
          work. To learn more about which standard frameworks are eligible for
          sharing, see Framework sharing eligibility in the Audit Manager User
          Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            start-assessment-framework-share
          --framework-id <value>
          --destination-account <value>
          --destination-region <value>
          [--comment <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --framework-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the custom framework to be shared.

       --destination-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account of the recipient.

       --destination-region (string)
          The Amazon Web Services Region of the recipient.

       --comment (string)
          An optional comment from the sender about the share request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
