NAME
       deregister-organization-admin-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified member Amazon Web Services account as a delegated
       administrator for Audit Manager.

       WARNING:
          When you remove a delegated administrator from  your  Audit  Manager
          settings,  you continue to have access to the evidence that you pre-
          viously collected under that account. This is also the case when you
          deregister  a  delegated  administrator from Audit Manager. However,
          Audit Manager will stop collecting and attaching  evidence  to  that
          delegated administrator account moving forward.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-organization-admin-account
          [--admin-account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --admin-account-id (string)
          The identifier for the administrator account.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
