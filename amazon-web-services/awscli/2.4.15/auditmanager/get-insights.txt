NAME
       get-insights -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the latest analytics data for all your current active assessments.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-insights
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       insights -> (structure)
          The analytics data that the GetInsights API returned.

          activeAssessmentsCount -> (integer)
              The number of active assessments in Audit Manager.

          noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified  as  non-compliant on the lastUpdated date. This includes
              evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a  Fail  rul-
              ing, or collected from Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

          compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified as compliant on the lastUpdated date. This includes  evi-
              dence  that  was collected from Security Hub with a Pass ruling,
              or collected from Config with a Compliant ruling.

          inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of evidence without a compliance check  ruling.  Evi-
              dence  is inconclusive when the associated control uses Security
              Hub or Config as a data source but you didn't enable those  ser-
              vices.  This  is also the case when a control uses a data source
              that doesnt support compliance checks (for example: manual  evi-
              dence, API calls, or CloudTrail).

              NOTE:
                 If evidence has a compliance check status of not applicable ,
                 it's classed as inconclusive in Insights data.

          assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence -> (integer)
              The number of assessment controls that  collected  non-compliant
              evidence on the lastUpdated date.

          totalAssessmentControlsCount -> (integer)
              The total number of controls across all active assessments.

          lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The time when the cross-assessment insights were last updated.
