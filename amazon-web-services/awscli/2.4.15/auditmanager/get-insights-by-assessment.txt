NAME
       get-insights-by-assessment -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the latest analytics data for a specific active assessment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-insights-by-assessment
          --assessment-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the assessment.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       insights -> (structure)
          The  assessment  analytics data that the GetInsightsByAssessment API
          returned.

          noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified  as  non-compliant.  This includes evidence that was col-
              lected from Security Hub with a Fail ruling, or  collected  from
              Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

          compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified as compliant. This includes evidence that  was  collected
              from  Security  Hub with a Pass ruling, or collected from Config
              with a Compliant ruling.

          inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The amount of evidence without a compliance check  ruling.  Evi-
              dence  is  inconclusive  if the associated control uses Security
              Hub or Config as a data source and you didn't enable those  ser-
              vices.  This  is  also  the case if a control uses a data source
              that doesnt support compliance checks (for example, manual  evi-
              dence, API calls, or CloudTrail).

              NOTE:
                 If evidence has a compliance check status of not applicable ,
                 it's classified as inconclusive in InsightsByAssessment data.

          assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence -> (integer)
              The  number  of assessment controls that collected non-compliant
              evidence on the lastUpdated date.

          totalAssessmentControlsCount -> (integer)
              The total number of controls in the assessment.

          lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The time when the assessment insights were last updated.
