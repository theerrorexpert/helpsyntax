NAME
       validate-assessment-report-integrity -

DESCRIPTION
       Validates the integrity of an assessment report in Audit Manager.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            validate-assessment-report-integrity
          --s3-relative-path <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --s3-relative-path (string)
          The relative path of the Amazon S3 bucket that the assessment report
          is stored in.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       signatureValid -> (boolean)

       signatureAlgorithm -> (string)

       signatureDateTime -> (string)
          The  date  and  time  signature  that  specifies when the assessment
          report was created.

       signatureKeyId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the validation signature key.

       validationErrors -> (list)
          Represents any errors that occurred when validating  the  assessment
