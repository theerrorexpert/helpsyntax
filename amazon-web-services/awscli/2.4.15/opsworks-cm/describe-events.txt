DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  events  for a specified server. Results are ordered by time,
       with newest events first.

       This operation is synchronous.

       A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist. A
       ValidationException  is  raised  when parameters of the request are not
       valid.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ServerEvents

SYNOPSIS
            describe-events
          --server-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server for which you want to view events.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe events

       The following describe-events example  returns  information  about  all
       events that are associated with the specified Chef Automate server.

          aws opsworks-cm describe-events --server-name 'automate-06'

       The  output  for each event entry returned by the command resembles the
       following example:

          {
              "ServerEvents": [
                  {
                      "CreatedAt": 2016-07-29T13:38:47.520Z,
                      "LogUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/automate-06/automate-06-20160729133847520",
                      "Message": "Updates successfully installed.",
                      "ServerName": "automate-06"
                  }
              ]
          }

       OpsWorks User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ServerEvents -> (list)
          Contains the response to a DescribeEvents request.

          (structure)
              An  event  that  is  related to the server, such as the start of
              maintenance or backup.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the event occurred.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 The name of the server on or for which the event occurred.

              Message -> (string)
                 A human-readable informational or status message.

              LogUrl -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URL of the event's log file.

       NextToken -> (string)
          NextToken is a string that is returned in some command responses. It
          indicates that not all entries have been returned, and that you must
          run at least one more request to get remaining items. To get remain-
          ing  results,  call  DescribeEvents again, and assign the token from
          the previous results as the value of  the  nextToken  parameter.  If
          there are no more results, the response object's nextToken parameter
          value is null . Setting a nextToken value that was not  returned  in
          your  previous results causes an InvalidNextTokenException to occur.
