NAME
       delete-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  backup.  You  can delete both manual and automated backups.
       This operation is asynchronous.

       An InvalidStateException is thrown when a backup deletion is already in
       progress.  A  ResourceNotFoundException  is thrown when the backup does
       not exist. A ValidationException  is  thrown  when  parameters  of  the
       request are not valid.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-backup
          --backup-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The  ID  of the backup to delete. Run the DescribeBackups command to
          get a list of backup IDs. Backup  IDs  are  in  the  format  Server-
          Name-yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete backups

       The  following  delete-backup  command  deletes  a  manual or automated
       backup of a Chef Automate server, identified by  the  backup  ID.  This
       command  is useful when you are approaching the maximum number of back-
       ups that you can save, or you want to minimize your Amazon  S3  storage
       costs.:

          aws opsworks-cm delete-backup --backup-id "automate-06-2016-11-19T23:42:40.240Z"

       The output shows whether the backup deletion succeeded.
