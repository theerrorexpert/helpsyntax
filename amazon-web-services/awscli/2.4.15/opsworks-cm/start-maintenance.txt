START-MAINTENANCE()                                        START-MAINTENANCE()



NAME
       start-maintenance -

DESCRIPTION
       Manually  starts  server  maintenance. This command can be useful if an
       earlier maintenance attempt failed, and the underlying cause of mainte-
       nance  failure has been resolved. The server is in an UNDER_MAINTENANCE
       state while maintenance is in progress.

       Maintenance can only be started on servers  in  HEALTHY  and  UNHEALTHY
       states.  Otherwise,  an InvalidStateException is thrown. A ResourceNot-
       FoundException is thrown when the server  does  not  exist.  A  Valida-
       tionException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-maintenance
          --server-name <value>
          [--engine-attributes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server on which to run maintenance.

       --engine-attributes (list)
          Engine  attributes that are specific to the server on which you want
          to run maintenance.
              Attributes accepted in a StartMaintenance request for Chef

          o CHEF_MAJOR_UPGRADE : If a Chef Automate  server  is  eligible  for
            upgrade  to Chef Automate 2, add this engine attribute to a Start-
            Maintenance request and set the  value  to  true  to  upgrade  the
            server  to  Chef  Automate 2. For more information, see Upgrade an
            AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate Server to Chef Automate 2 .

          (structure)
              A name and value pair that is specific  to  the  engine  of  the
              server.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the engine attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the engine attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start maintenance

       The  following start-maintenance example manually starts maintenance on
       the specified Chef Automate or Puppet Enterprise server in your default
       region.  This  command  is  useful if an earlier, automated maintenance
       attempt failed, and the underlying cause  of  maintenance  failure  has
       been resolved.

          aws opsworks-cm start-maintenance \
              --server-name 'automate-06'

              The number of automated backups to keep.

          ServerName -> (string)
              The name of the server.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)

          CloudFormationStackArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the CloudFormation stack that was used to create  the

              An   optional   public   endpoint   of   a   server,   such   as
              https://aws.my-company.com . You cannot  access  the  server  by

              fied.

          DisableAutomatedBackup -> (boolean)
              Disables automated backups. The  number  of  stored  backups  is

              main specified.

          Engine -> (string)

              include Monolithic for Puppet and Single for Chef.

          EngineAttributes -> (list)
              The response of a createServer() request returns the master cre-
              dential  to access the server in EngineAttributes. These creden-
              tials are not stored by AWS OpsWorks CM; they are returned  only
              as part of the result of createServer().
                 Attributes returned in a createServer response for Chef

              o CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY  :  A base64-encoded RSA private key
                that is generated by AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate. This pri-
                vate key is required to access the Chef API.

                contains a Chef starter kit, which includes a README,  a  con-
                figuration  file,  and the required RSA private key. Save this
                file, unzip it, and then change to the directory where  you've
                unzipped  the  file contents. From this directory, you can run
                Knife commands.
                 Attributes returned in a createServer response for Puppet

              o PUPPET_STARTER_KIT : A base64-encoded ZIP file. The  ZIP  file

                required private key. Save  this  file,  unzip  it,  and  then
                change  to  the  directory where you've unzipped the file con-
                tents.

              o PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD : An administrator password that you can
                use  to  sign  in  to  the Puppet Enterprise console after the
