NAME
       describe-account-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes your OpsWorks-CM account attributes.

       This operation is synchronous.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account-attributes
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe account attributes

       The  following  describe-account-attributes command returns information
       about  your  account's  usage  of  AWS  OpsWorks  for   Chef   Automate
       resources.:

          aws opsworks-cm describe-account-attributes

       The  output  for  each  account attribute entry returned by the command
       resembles the following.  Output:

          {
           "Attributes": [
              {
                 "Maximum": 5,
                 "Name": "ServerLimit",
                 "Used": 2
              }
           ]
          }
