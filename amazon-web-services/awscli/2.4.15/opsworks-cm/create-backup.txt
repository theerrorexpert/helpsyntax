CREATE-BACKUP()                                                CREATE-BACKUP()



NAME
       create-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is in
       the BACKING_UP state, the server cannot be changed, and  no  additional
       backup can be created.

       Backups can be created for servers in RUNNING , HEALTHY , and UNHEALTHY
       states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups.

       This operation is asynchronous.

       A LimitExceededException is thrown when the maximum  number  of  manual
       backups  is reached. An InvalidStateException is thrown when the server
       is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or  UNHEALTHY.
       A  ResourceNotFoundException  is thrown when the server is not found. A
       ValidationException is thrown when parameters of the  request  are  not
       valid.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          --server-name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--tags <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server that you want to back up.

       --description (string)
          A user-defined description of the backup.

       --tags (list)
          A  map  that  contains  tag  keys and tag values to attach to an AWS
          OpsWorks-CM server backup.

          o The key cannot be empty.

          o The key can be a maximum of 127 characters, and can  contain  only
            Unicode  letters, numbers, or separators, or the following special
            characters: + - = . _ : /

            characters: + - = . _ : /

          o Leading and trailing white spaces are trimmed from  both  the  key
            and value.

          o A maximum of 50 user-applied tags is allowed for tag-supported AWS
            OpsWorks-CM resources.

          (structure)
              A map that contains tag keys and tag values to attach to an  AWS
              OpsWorks for Chef Automate or AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise
              server. Leading and trailing white spaces are trimmed from  both
              the  key and value. A maximum of 50 user-applied tags is allowed
              for tag-supported AWS OpsWorks-CM resources.

              Key -> (string)
                 A tag key, such as Stage or Name . A tag key cannot be empty.
                 The  key  can be a maximum of 127 characters, and can contain
                 only Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the  follow-
                 ing special characters: + - = . _ : /

              Value -> (string)
                 An optional tag value, such as Production or test-owcm-server
                 . The value can be a maximum of 255 characters,  and  contain
                 only  Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the follow-
                 ing special characters: + - = . _ : /

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create backups

       The following create-backup command starts a manual backup  of  a  Chef
       Automate  server named automate-06 in the us-east-1 region. The command
       adds a descriptive message to the backup in the  --description  parame-
       ter.:

          aws opsworks-cm create-backup --server-name 'automate-06' --description "state of my infrastructure at launch"

       The output shows you information similar to the following about the new
       backup.  Output:
