DELETE-SERVER()                                                DELETE-SERVER()



NAME
       delete-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  server  and  the  underlying  AWS  CloudFormation  stacks
       (including the server's EC2 instance). When you run this  command,  the
       server  state  is updated to DELETING . After the server is deleted, it
       is no longer returned by DescribeServer requests. If the AWS  CloudFor-
       mation stack cannot be deleted, the server cannot be deleted.

       This operation is asynchronous.

       An InvalidStateException is thrown when a server deletion is already in
       progress. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when  the  server  does
       not  exist.  A  ValidationException  is  raised  when parameters of the
       request are not valid.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-server
          --server-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The ID of the server to delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete servers

       The following delete-server command deletes  a  Chef  Automate  server,
       identified  by the server's name. After the server is deleted, it is no
       longer returned by DescribeServer requests.:

          aws opsworks-cm delete-server --server-name "automate-06"

       The output shows whether the server deletion succeeded.

       Server in the AWS OpsWorks User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
