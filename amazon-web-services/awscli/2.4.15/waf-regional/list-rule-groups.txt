DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  RuleGroup objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-rule-groups
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and you have more  RuleGroups  than
          the  value  of  Limit  ,  AWS  WAF returns a NextMarker value in the
          response that allows you to list another group of RuleGroups  .  For
          the second and subsequent ListRuleGroups requests, specify the value
          of NextMarker from the previous response to  get  information  about
          another batch of RuleGroups .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies  the  number of RuleGroups that you want AWS WAF to return
          for this request. If you have more RuleGroups than the  number  that
          you  specify  for  Limit  , the response includes a NextMarker value
          that you can use to get another batch of RuleGroups .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more RuleGroups than the number that you  specified  for
          Limit  in  the request, the response includes a NextMarker value. To
          list more RuleGroups , submit another  ListRuleGroups  request,  and
          specify  the  NextMarker  value  from the response in the NextMarker
          value in the next request.

       RuleGroups -> (list)
          An array of  RuleGroup objects.

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              Contains the identifier and the friendly name or description  of
              the RuleGroup .

              RuleGroupId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for a RuleGroup . You use RuleGroupId to
                 get more information about a RuleGroup (see  GetRuleGroup  ),
                 update  a  RuleGroup  (see  UpdateRuleGroup ), insert a Rule-
                 Group into  a  WebACL  or  delete  one  from  a  WebACL  (see
                 UpdateWebACL  ),  or  delete  a  RuleGroup  from AWS WAF (see
                 DeleteRuleGroup ).
                     RuleGroupId  is  returned  by   CreateRuleGroup  and   by
                     ListRuleGroups .

              Name -> (string)
                 A  friendly name or description of the  RuleGroup . You can't
                 change the name of a RuleGroup after you create it.
