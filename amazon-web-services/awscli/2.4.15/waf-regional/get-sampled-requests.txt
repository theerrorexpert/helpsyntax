NAME
       get-sampled-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Gets detailed information about a specified number of requests--a  sam-
       ple--that  AWS WAF randomly selects from among the first 5,000 requests
       that your AWS resource received during a time range  that  you  choose.
       You  can specify a sample size of up to 500 requests, and you can spec-
       ify any time range in the previous three hours.
          GetSampledRequests returns a time range, which is usually  the  time
          range  that  you  specified.  However,  if  your resource (such as a
          CloudFront distribution) received 5,000 requests before  the  speci-
          fied  time range elapsed, GetSampledRequests returns an updated time
          range. This new time range indicates the actual period during  which
          AWS WAF selected the requests in the sample.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-sampled-requests
          --web-acl-id <value>
          --rule-id <value>
          --time-window <value>
          --max-items <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --web-acl-id (string)
          The  WebACLId of the WebACL for which you want GetSampledRequests to
          return a sample of requests.

       --rule-id (string)
              RuleId is one of three values:

          o The RuleId of the Rule or the RuleGroupId  of  the  RuleGroup  for
            which  you want GetSampledRequests to return a sample of requests.

          o Default_Action , which causes GetSampledRequests to return a  sam-
            ple  of  the  requests  that  didn't match any of the rules in the
            specified WebACL .

       --time-window (structure)
          The start date and time and the end date and time of the  range  for
          which  you  want  GetSampledRequests to return a sample of requests.
          You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)  for-
          mat.  UTC  format  includes the special designator, Z . For example,
          "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can specify any time range in the previous
          three hours.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The  beginning  of the time range from which you want GetSample-
              dRequests to return a sample  of  the  requests  that  your  AWS
              resource received. You must specify the date and time in Coordi-
              nated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the  spe-
              cial  designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can
              specify any time range in the previous three hours.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The end of the time range from which you want GetSampledRequests
              to  return  a  sample  of  the  requests  that your AWS resource
              received. You must specify the date and time in Coordinated Uni-
              versal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special desig-
              nator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" .  You  can  specify
              any time range in the previous three hours.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartTime=timestamp,EndTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StartTime": timestamp,
            "EndTime": timestamp
          }

       --max-items (long)
          The  number  of  requests that you want AWS WAF to return from among
          the first 5,000 requests that your AWS resource received during  the
          time  range. If your resource received fewer requests than the value
          of MaxItems , GetSampledRequests returns information  about  all  of
          them.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SampledRequests -> (list)
          A  complex type that contains detailed information about each of the
          requests in the sample.

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              The response from a  GetSampledRequests request includes a  Sam-
              pledHTTPRequests complex type that appears as SampledRequests in
              the response syntax. SampledHTTPRequests contains  one  Sampled-
              HTTPRequest object for each web request that is returned by Get-
              SampledRequests .

              Request -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains detailed information  about  the
                 request.

                 ClientIP -> (string)
                     The  IP  address that the request originated from. If the
                     WebACL is associated with a CloudFront distribution, this
                     is the value of one of the following fields in CloudFront
                     access logs:

                     o c-ip , if the viewer did not use an  HTTP  proxy  or  a
                       load balancer to send the request

                     o x-forwarded-for  ,  if the viewer did use an HTTP proxy
                       or a load balancer to send the request

                 Country -> (string)
                     The two-letter country code  for  the  country  that  the
                     request  originated  from.  For a current list of country
                     codes, see the Wikipedia entry ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 .

                 URI -> (string)
                     The part of a web request that identifies  the  resource,
                     for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                 Method -> (string)
                     The  HTTP  method  specified  in the sampled web request.
                     CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET ,
                     HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .

                 HTTPVersion -> (string)
                     The  HTTP  version  specified in the sampled web request,
                     for example, HTTP/1.1 .

                 Headers -> (list)
                     A complex type that contains two values for  each  header
                     in  the  sampled  web request: the name of the header and
                     the value of the header.

                        NOTE:
                            This is AWS WAF Classic  documentation.  For  more
                            information,  see AWS WAF Classic in the developer
                            guide.
                               For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS
                               WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .
                               With the latest version, AWS WAF has  a  single
                               set of endpoints for regional and global use.

                        The   response   from  a   GetSampledRequests  request
                        includes an HTTPHeader complex type  that  appears  as
                        Headers  in  the  response syntax. HTTPHeader contains
                        the names and values of all of the headers that appear
                        in  one of the web requests that were returned by Get-
                        SampledRequests .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of one of the headers in the sampled  web
                            request.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of one of the headers in the sampled web
                            request.

              Weight -> (long)
                 A value that indicates how one result in the response relates
                 proportionally  to  other  results  in the response. A result
                 that has a weight of  2  represents  roughly  twice  as  many
                 CloudFront  web requests as a result that has a weight of 1 .

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which AWS WAF received the request from your  AWS
                 resource, in Unix time format (in seconds).

              Action -> (string)
                 The  action  for  the  Rule that the request matched: ALLOW ,
                 BLOCK , or COUNT .

              RuleWithinRuleGroup -> (string)
                 This value is  returned  if  the  GetSampledRequests  request
                 specifies  the  ID  of  a  RuleGroup rather than the ID of an
                 individual rule. RuleWithinRuleGroup is the rule  within  the
                 specified  RuleGroup  that  matched the request listed in the
                 response.

       PopulationSize -> (long)
          The total number of requests from  which  GetSampledRequests  got  a
          sample of MaxItems requests. If PopulationSize is less than MaxItems
          , the sample includes every request that your AWS resource  received
          during the specified time range.

       TimeWindow -> (structure)
          Usually, TimeWindow is the time range that you specified in the Get-
          SampledRequests request. However, if your AWS resource received more
          than  5,000 requests during the time range that you specified in the
          request, GetSampledRequests returns the time  range  for  the  first
          5,000  requests.  Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for-
          mat.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The beginning of the time range from which you  want  GetSample-
              dRequests  to  return  a  sample  of  the requests that your AWS
              resource received. You must specify the date and time in Coordi-
              nated  Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the spe-
              cial designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You  can
              specify any time range in the previous three hours.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The end of the time range from which you want GetSampledRequests
              to return a sample  of  the  requests  that  your  AWS  resource
              received. You must specify the date and time in Coordinated Uni-
              versal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special desig-
              nator,  Z  .  For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can specify
              any time range in the previous three hours.
