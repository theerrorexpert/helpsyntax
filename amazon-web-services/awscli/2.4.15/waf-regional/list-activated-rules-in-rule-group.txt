DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  ActivatedRule objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-activated-rules-in-rule-group
          [--rule-group-id <value>]
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-group-id (string)
          The RuleGroupId of the  RuleGroup for which you want to get  a  list
          of  ActivatedRule objects.

       --next-marker (string)
          If  you  specify  a value for Limit and you have more ActivatedRules
          than the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value in  the
          response  that  allows you to list another group of ActivatedRules .
          For  the   second   and   subsequent   ListActivatedRulesInRuleGroup
          requests, specify the value of NextMarker from the previous response
          to get information about another batch of ActivatedRules .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies the number of ActivatedRules that  you  want  AWS  WAF  to
          return  for  this  request. If you have more ActivatedRules than the
          number that  you  specify  for  Limit  ,  the  response  includes  a
          NextMarker  value that you can use to get another batch of Activate-
          dRules .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more ActivatedRules than the number that  you  specified
          for  Limit in the request, the response includes a NextMarker value.
          To list more ActivatedRules , submit  another  ListActivatedRulesIn-
          RuleGroup  request,  and  specify  the  NextMarker  value  from  the
          response in the NextMarker value in the next request.

       ActivatedRules -> (list)
          An array of ActivatedRules objects.

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              The ActivatedRule object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a
              Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the Rule
              in the WebACL , and the action that you want  AWS  WAF  to  take
              when a web request matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).

              To specify whether to insert or delete a Rule , use  the  Action
              parameter in the  WebACLUpdate data type.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 Specifies the order in which the Rules in a WebACL are evalu-
                 ated. Rules with a lower value  for  Priority  are  evaluated
                 before  Rules with a higher value. The value must be a unique
                 integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL ,  the  values
                 don't need to be consecutive.

              RuleId -> (string)
                 The  RuleId  for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more informa-
                 tion about a  Rule  (see   GetRule  ),  update  a  Rule  (see
                 UpdateRule  ),  insert  a  Rule into a WebACL or delete a one
                 from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS
                 WAF (see  DeleteRule ).
                     RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

              Action -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a
                 web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values
                 for Action include the following:

                 o ALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

                 o BLOCK  :  CloudFront  responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden)
                   status code.

                 o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match
                   the  conditions  in  the rule and then continues to inspect
                   the web request based on the remaining  rules  in  the  web
                   ACL.
                     ActivatedRule|OverrideAction  applies  only when updating
                     or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you  do
                     not  use  ActivatedRule|Action  .  For  all  other update
                     requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead  of  Acti-
                     vatedRule|OverrideAction .

                 Type -> (string)
                     Specifies  how  you  want  AWS WAF to respond to requests
                     that match the  settings  in  a  Rule  .  Valid  settings
                     include the following:

                     o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

                     o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

                     o COUNT  :  AWS  WAF increments a counter of the requests
                       that match all of the conditions in the rule.  AWS  WAF
                       then  continues to inspect the web request based on the
                       remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify COUNT
                       for the default action for a WebACL .

              OverrideAction -> (structure)
                 Use the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .

                 Any  rule  in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If
                 you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block
                 a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the
                 request and is configured to block that request.  However  if
                 you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction
                 to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block  action
                 specified  by  individual  rules  contained within the group.
                 Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be
                 counted.  You  can  view  a  record of counted requests using
                 GetSampledRequests .
                     ActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only  when  updating
                     or  adding  a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do
                     not use  ActivatedRule|Action  .  For  all  other  update
                     requests,  ActivatedRule|Action  is used instead of Acti-
                     vatedRule|OverrideAction .

                 Type -> (string)
                     COUNT overrides the action specified  by  the  individual
                     rule  within  a  RuleGroup  . If set to NONE , the rule's
                     action will take place.

              Type -> (string)
                 The rule type,  either  REGULAR  ,  as  defined  by   Rule  ,
                 RATE_BASED  ,  as  defined  by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as
                 defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this
                 field  is  optional,  be  aware  that  if  you  try  to add a
                 RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting  the  type,  the
                 UpdateWebACL  request  will fail because the request tries to
                 add a REGULAR rule with the  specified  ID,  which  does  not
                 exist.

              ExcludedRules -> (list)
                 An  array  of  rules  to  exclude  from a rule group. This is
                 applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a  RuleGroup
                 .

                 Sometimes  it  is  necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that
                 are blocking  traffic  unexpectedly  (false  positives).  One
                 troubleshooting  technique  is  to identify the specific rule
                 within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic
                 and  then  disable  (exclude)  that  particular rule. You can
                 exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS  Market-
                 place rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

                 Specifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the
                 rule group. Rather, it changes the action for  the  rules  to
                 COUNT  .  Therefore,  requests that match an ExcludedRule are
                 counted but not blocked. The  RuleGroup  owner  will  receive
                 COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .

                 If  you  want  to  exclude  rules  from  a rule group that is
                 already associated with a  web  ACL,  perform  the  following
                 steps:

                 o Use  the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that
                   you want to exclude. For more information about  the  logs,
                   see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .

                 o Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

                   o The first action deletes the existing rule group from the
                     web ACL. That is, in the  UpdateWebACL request, the first
                     Updates:Action  should  be  DELETE  and Updates:Activate-
                     dRule:RuleId should be the rule group that  contains  the
                     rules that you want to exclude.

                   o The  second  action  inserts the same rule group back in,
                     but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the  second
                     Updates:Action   should  be  INSERT  ,  Updates:Activate-
                     dRule:RuleId should be  the  rule  group  that  you  just
                     removed,  and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that
                     you want to exclude.

                     The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable
                     only  when  the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup . The
                     rule must belong to the RuleGroup that  is  specified  by
                     the ActivatedRule .

                     RuleId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from the
                        rule group.
