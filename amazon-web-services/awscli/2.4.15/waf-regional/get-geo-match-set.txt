DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  GeoMatchSet that is specified by GeoMatchSetId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-geo-match-set
          --geo-match-set-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --geo-match-set-id (string)
          The GeoMatchSetId of the  GeoMatchSet that you  want  to  get.  Geo-
          MatchSetId  is  returned by  CreateGeoMatchSet and by  ListGeoMatch-
          Sets .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GeoMatchSet -> (structure)
          Information about the  GeoMatchSet that you specified in the GetGeo-
          MatchSet  request. This includes the Type , which for a GeoMatchCon-
          traint is always Country , as well as the Value , which is the iden-
          tifier for a specific country.

          GeoMatchSetId -> (string)
              The  GeoMatchSetId for an GeoMatchSet . You use GeoMatchSetId to
              get information about a GeoMatchSet (see  GeoMatchSet ),  update
              a  GeoMatchSet  (see   UpdateGeoMatchSet ), insert a GeoMatchSet
              into a Rule or delete one from a Rule (see   UpdateRule  ),  and
              delete a GeoMatchSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteGeoMatchSet ).
                 GeoMatchSetId is returned by  CreateGeoMatchSet and by  List-
                 GeoMatchSets .

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description of the  GeoMatchSet .  You  can't
              change the name of an GeoMatchSet after you create it.

          GeoMatchConstraints -> (list)
              An array of  GeoMatchConstraint objects, which contain the coun-
              try that you want AWS WAF to search for.
