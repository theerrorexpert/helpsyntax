DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  LoggingConfiguration objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-logging-configurations
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and you have more LoggingConfigura-
          tions  than  the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value
          in the response that allows you to list another group of LoggingCon-
          figurations  .  For  the second and subsequent ListLoggingConfigura-
          tions requests, specify the value of NextMarker  from  the  previous
          response  to  get information about another batch of ListLoggingCon-
          figurations .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies the number of LoggingConfigurations that you want AWS  WAF
          to  return  for this request. If you have more LoggingConfigurations
          than the number that you specify for Limit , the response includes a
          NextMarker  value  that you can use to get another batch of Logging-
          Configurations .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LoggingConfigurations -> (list)
          An array of  LoggingConfiguration objects.

                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              The Amazon Kinesis Data  Firehose,  RedactedFields  information,
              and the web ACL Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you want
                 to associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

              LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
                 An array of Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose ARNs.

                 (string)

              RedactedFields -> (list)
                 The parts of the request that  you  want  redacted  from  the
                 logs. For example, if you redact the cookie field, the cookie
                 field in the firehose will be xxx .

                        mation, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                            For  the  latest  version of AWS WAF , use the AWS
                            WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF  Developer  Guide  .
                            With  the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set
                            of endpoints for regional and global use.

                     Specifies where in a web request to look for TargetString
                     .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want AWS WAF to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER  :  A  specified request header, for example,
                          the value of the User-Agent or  Referer  header.  If
                          you  choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated  the  type
                          of  operation  that the request is asking the origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods:  DELETE  ,  GET  , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part  of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI  :  The  part of a web request that identifies a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as the HTTP request body, such as data from a  form.
                          The  request  body  immediately  follows the request
                          headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of  the
                          request  body  are  forwarded to AWS WAF for inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of  the  body, you can create a size constraint set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                          rather  than  inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value  or  regex pattern that you specify in Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When the value of Type is HEADER , enter the  name  of
                        the  header that you want AWS WAF to search, for exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for  example,  UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more LoggingConfigurations  than  the  number  that  you
          specified  for  Limit  in  the  request,  the  response  includes  a
          NextMarker  value.  To  list  more  LoggingConfigurations  ,  submit
          another   ListLoggingConfigurations   request,   and   specify   the
          NextMarker value from the response in the NextMarker  value  in  the
          next request.
