DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Retrieves the tags associated with the specified AWS resource. Tags are
       key:value  pairs  that  you  can  use  to  categorize  and  manage your
       resources, for purposes like billing. For example, you  might  set  the
       tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You can
       specify one or more tags to add to each AWS resource, up to 50 tags for
       a resource.

       Tagging  is  only  available  through the API, SDKs, and CLI. You can't
       manage or view tags through the AWS WAF Classic console.  You  can  tag
       the  AWS  resources  that you manage through AWS WAF Classic: web ACLs,
       rule groups, and rules.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-for-resource
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)

       --limit (integer)

       --resource-arn (string)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)

       TagInfoForResource -> (structure)
          ResourceARN -> (string)

          TagList -> (list)
              (structure)

                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the

                        for regional and global use.

                 A tag associated with an AWS  resource.  Tags  are  key:value
                 pairs  that  you  can  use  to  categorize  and  manage  your
                 resources, for purposes like billing. For example, you  might
                 set  the  tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer
                 name or ID. You can specify one or more tags to add  to  each
                 AWS resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

                 Tagging is only available through the API, SDKs, and CLI. You
                 can't manage or view tags through the AWS  WAF  Classic  con-
