DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  Rule that is specified by the RuleId that you included  in
       the GetRule request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rule
          --rule-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-id (string)
          The  RuleId of the  Rule that you want to get. RuleId is returned by
          CreateRule and by  ListRules .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Rule -> (structure)
          Information about the   Rule  that  you  specified  in  the  GetRule
          request. For more information, see the following topics:

          o Rule : Contains MetricName , Name , an array of Predicate objects,
            and RuleId

          o Predicate : Each Predicate object contains DataId , Negated ,  and
            Type

          RuleId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier  for  a  Rule . You use RuleId to get more
              information about a Rule (see  GetRule ),  update  a  Rule  (see
              UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a
              WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF  (see
              DeleteRule ).
                 RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

          Name -> (string)
              The friendly name or description for the Rule . You can't change
              the name of a Rule after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A friendly name or description for the metrics for this  Rule  .
              The  name  can  contain  only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z,
              0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one.  It  can't
              contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, includ-
              ing "All" and  "Default_Action."  You  can't  change  MetricName
              after you create the Rule .

          Predicates -> (list)
              The  Predicates  object  contains one Predicate element for each
              ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet , or  SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you
              want to include in a Rule .

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2
                        API  and  see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the
                        latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies  the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet
                 ,  XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  and   Size-
                 ConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a Rule and, for
                 each object, indicates whether you want to  negate  the  set-
                 tings,  for  example, requests that do NOT originate from the
                 IP address 192.0.2.44.

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or  count requests based on the settings in the specified
                     ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet  ,   Xss-
                     MatchSet  ,   RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an  IPSet  includes  the  IP
                     address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or block requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a  request  based  on the negation of the settings in the
                     ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet  ,   Xss-
                     MatchSet  ,   RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an  IPSet  includes  the  IP
                     address  192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow, block, or count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of predicate in a Rule , such  as  ByteMatch  or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A  unique  identifier for a predicate in a Rule , such as
                     ByteMatchSetId or IPSetId . The ID  is  returned  by  the
                     corresponding Create or List command.
