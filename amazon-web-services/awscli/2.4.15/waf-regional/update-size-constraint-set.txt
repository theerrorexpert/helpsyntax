DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  SizeConstraint objects  (filters)  in  a   SizeCon-
       straintSet  . For each SizeConstraint object, you specify the following
       values:

       o Whether to insert or delete the object from the array. If you want to
         change  a  SizeConstraintSetUpdate  object,  you  delete the existing
         object and add a new one.

       o The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to evaluate, such  as
         the  length of a query string or the length of the User-Agent header.

       o Whether to perform any transformations on the request, such  as  con-
         verting it to lowercase, before checking its length. Note that trans-
         formations of the request body are  not  supported  because  the  AWS
         resource  forwards  only  the first 8192 bytes of your request to AWS
         WAF. You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

       o A ComparisonOperator used for evaluating the  selected  part  of  the
         request  against  the  specified Size , such as equals, greater than,
         less than, and so on.

       o The length, in bytes, that you want AWS WAF to watch for in  selected
         part of the request. The length is computed after applying the trans-
         formation.

       For example, you can add a SizeConstraintSetUpdate object that  matches
       web  requests  in  which the length of the User-Agent header is greater
       than 100 bytes. You can then configure AWS WAF to block those requests.

       To  create  and  configure  a SizeConstraintSet , perform the following
       steps:

       o Create a SizeConstraintSet. For more information, see  CreateSizeCon-
         straintSet .

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request.

       o Submit an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request to specify the part of  the
         request  that you want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header or
         the URI) and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

          o FieldToMatch : Contains Data and Type

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              Specifies the part of a web request that you want to inspect the
              size  of and indicates whether you want to add the specification
              to a  SizeConstraintSet or delete it from a SizeConstraintSet  .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specify  INSERT to add a  SizeConstraintSetUpdate to a  Size-
                 ConstraintSet . Use DELETE to remove  a  SizeConstraintSetUp-
                 date from a SizeConstraintSet .

              SizeConstraint -> (structure)
                 Specifies  a  constraint  on  the  size  of a part of the web
                 request. AWS WAF uses the Size  ,  ComparisonOperator  ,  and
                 FieldToMatch  to  build  an  expression  in the form of "Size
                 ComparisonOperator size in bytes of FieldToMatch ".  If  that
                 expression  is  true,  the  SizeConstraint  is  considered to
                 match.

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     Specifies where in a web request to  look  for  the  size
                     constraint.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want AWS WAF to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER  :  A  specified request header, for example,
                          the value of the User-Agent or  Referer  header.  If
                          you  choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated  the  type
                          of  operation  that the request is asking the origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods:  DELETE  ,  GET  , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part  of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI  :  The  part of a web request that identifies a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as the HTTP request body, such as data from a  form.
                          The  request  body  immediately  follows the request
                          headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of  the
                          request  body  are  forwarded to AWS WAF for inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of  the  body, you can create a size constraint set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                          rather  than  inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value  or  regex pattern that you specify in Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When the value of Type is HEADER , enter the  name  of
                        the  header that you want AWS WAF to search, for exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for  example,  UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text transformations eliminate some of the  unusual  for-
                     matting  that  attackers use in web requests in an effort
                     to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a  transformation,  AWS
                     WAF  performs  the  transformation on FieldToMatch before
                     inspecting it for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

                     Note  that if you choose BODY for the value of Type , you
                     must choose NONE for  TextTransformation  because  Cloud-
                     Front  forwards only the first 8192 bytes for inspection.
                        NONE

                     Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text trans-
                     formations.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When  you're  concerned  that  attackers are injecting an
                     operating system command line command and  using  unusual
                     formatting  to  disguise  some or all of the command, use
                     this option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use this option to replace the following characters  with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use this option to replace HTML-encoded  characters  with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with  a  non-breaking  space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces  characters  that  are  represented in decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE

                     Use  this  option  to  convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                     lowercase (a-z).
                        URL_DECODE

                     Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

                 ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                     The type of comparison you want AWS WAF to  perform.  AWS
                     WAF  uses  this in combination with the provided Size and
                     FieldToMatch to build an expression in the form of  "Size
                     ComparisonOperator  size  in  bytes of FieldToMatch ". If
                     that expression is true, the SizeConstraint is considered
                     to match.
                        EQ  : Used to test if the Size is equal to the size of
                        the FieldToMatch

                        NE : Used to test if the Size is not equal to the size
                        of the FieldToMatch

                        LE : Used to test if the Size is less than or equal to
                        the size of the FieldToMatch

                        LT : Used to test if the Size is  strictly  less  than
                        the size of the FieldToMatch

                        GE : Used to test if the Size is greater than or equal
                        to the size of the FieldToMatch

                        GT : Used to test if the Size is strictly greater than
                        the size of the FieldToMatch

                 Size -> (long)
                     The  size  in  bytes  that  you  want  AWS WAF to compare
                     against the size of the specified FieldToMatch . AWS  WAF
                     uses  this  in  combination  with  ComparisonOperator and
                     FieldToMatch to build an expression in the form of  "Size
                     ComparisonOperator  size  in  bytes of FieldToMatch ". If
                     that expression is true, the SizeConstraint is considered
                     to match.

                     Valid  values  for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20
                     GB).

                     If you specify URI for the value of Type , the /  in  the
                     URI  counts  as  one  character.  For  example,  the  URI
                     /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action=string,SizeConstraint={FieldToMatch={Type=string,Data=string},TextTransformation=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Size=long} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": "INSERT"|"DELETE",
              "SizeConstraint": {
                "FieldToMatch": {
                  "Type": "URI"|"QUERY_STRING"|"HEADER"|"METHOD"|"BODY"|"SINGLE_QUERY_ARG"|"ALL_QUERY_ARGS",
                  "Data": "string"
                },
                "TextTransformation": "NONE"|"COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE"|"HTML_ENTITY_DECODE"|"LOWERCASE"|"CMD_LINE"|"URL_DECODE",
                "ComparisonOperator": "EQ"|"NE"|"LE"|"LT"|"GE"|"GT",
                "Size": long
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To update a size constraint set

       The following update-size-constraint-set command   deletes  a  SizeCon-
       straint` object (filters) in a size constraint set. Because the updates
       value contains embedded double quotes, you  must  surround  the  entire
       value with single quotes.

          aws waf-regional update-size-constraint-set \
              --size-constraint-set-id a123fae4-b567-8e90-1234-5ab67ac8ca90 \
              --change-token 12cs345-67cd-890b-1cd2-c3a4567d89f1 \
              --updates 'Action="DELETE",SizeConstraint={FieldToMatch={Type="QUERY_STRING"},TextTransformation="NONE",ComparisonOperator="GT",Size=0}'

       For  more  information,  see Working with Size Constraint Conditions in
       the AWS WAF Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the  UpdateSizeConstraintSet
          request.  You  can  also  use  this value to query the status of the
          request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
