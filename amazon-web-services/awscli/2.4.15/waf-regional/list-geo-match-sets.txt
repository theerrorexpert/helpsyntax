DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  GeoMatchSetSummary objects in the response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-geo-match-sets
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and you  have  more  GeoMatchSet  s
          than  the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value in the
          response that allows  you  to  list  another  group  of  GeoMatchSet
          objects.  For  the  second and subsequent ListGeoMatchSets requests,
          specify the value of NextMarker from the previous  response  to  get
          information about another batch of GeoMatchSet objects.

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies the number of GeoMatchSet objects that you want AWS WAF to
          return for this request. If you have more GeoMatchSet  objects  than
          the  number  you  specify  for  Limit  ,  the  response  includes  a
          NextMarker value that you can use to get another batch of  GeoMatch-
          Set objects.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more GeoMatchSet objects than the number that you speci-
          fied for Limit in the request, the response  includes  a  NextMarker
          value.  To  list  more  GeoMatchSet objects, submit another ListGeo-
          MatchSets  request,  and  specify  the  NextMarker  value  from  the
          response in the NextMarker value in the next request.

       GeoMatchSets -> (list)
          An array of  GeoMatchSetSummary objects.

                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest

                     regional and global use.

              Contains the identifier and the name of the GeoMatchSet .

              GeoMatchSetId -> (string)
                 The GeoMatchSetId for an  GeoMatchSet . You can use GeoMatch-
                 SetId in a  GetGeoMatchSet request to get  detailed  informa-
                 tion about an  GeoMatchSet .

              Name -> (string)
                 A  friendly  name  or  description  of the  GeoMatchSet . You
                 can't change the name of an GeoMatchSet after you create  it.
