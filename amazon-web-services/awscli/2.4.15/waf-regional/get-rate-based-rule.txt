DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  RateBasedRule that is specified by  the  RuleId  that  you
       included in the GetRateBasedRule request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rate-based-rule
          --rule-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-id (string)
          The  RuleId  of  the   RateBasedRule that you want to get. RuleId is
          returned by  CreateRateBasedRule and by  ListRateBasedRules .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Rule -> (structure)
          Information about the   RateBasedRule  that  you  specified  in  the
          GetRateBasedRule request.

          RuleId -> (string)
              A  unique identifier for a RateBasedRule . You use RuleId to get
              more information about a RateBasedRule (see  GetRateBasedRule ),
              update  a  RateBasedRule  (see   UpdateRateBasedRule ), insert a
              RateBasedRule into a WebACL or delete one  from  a  WebACL  (see
              UpdateWebACL  ),  or  delete  a  RateBasedRule from AWS WAF (see
              DeleteRateBasedRule ).

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description for a RateBasedRule .  You  can't
              change the name of a RateBasedRule after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A  friendly  name or description for the metrics for a RateBase-
              dRule . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters  (A-Z,
              a-z,  0-9),  with  maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It
              can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for  AWS  WAF,
              including  "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name
              of the metric after you create the RateBasedRule .

          MatchPredicates -> (list)
              The Predicates object contains one Predicate  element  for  each
              ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet , or  SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you
              want to include in a RateBasedRule .

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet
                 ,   XssMatchSet  ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , and  Size-
                 ConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a Rule and, for
                 each  object,  indicates  whether you want to negate the set-
                 tings, for example, requests that do NOT originate  from  the
                 IP address 192.0.2.44.

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or count requests based on the settings in the  specified
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet  .  For  example,  if an IPSet includes the IP
                     address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or block requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a request based on the negation of the  settings  in  the
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet  .  For  example,  if an IPSet includes the IP
                     address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow, block, or  count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatch or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a predicate in a Rule ,  such  as
                     ByteMatchSetId  or  IPSetId  .  The ID is returned by the
                     corresponding Create or List command.

          RateKey -> (string)
              The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are  likely
              arriving from single source and thus subject to rate monitoring.
              The only valid value for RateKey  is  IP  .  IP  indicates  that
              requests  arriving  from  the same IP address are subject to the
              RateLimit that is specified in the RateBasedRule .

          RateLimit -> (long)
              The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in
              the  field  specified  by the RateKey , allowed in a five-minute
              period. If the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and  the
              other  predicates  specified  in  the rule are also met, AWS WAF
              triggers the action that is specified for this rule.
