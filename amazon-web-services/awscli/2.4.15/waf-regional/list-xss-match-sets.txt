DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  XssMatchSet objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-xss-match-sets
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit  and  you  have  more   XssMatchSet
          objects than the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value
          in the response that allows you to list another group  of  XssMatch-
          Sets  .  For  the  second  and subsequent ListXssMatchSets requests,
          specify the value of NextMarker from the previous  response  to  get
          information about another batch of XssMatchSets .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies  the  number of  XssMatchSet objects that you want AWS WAF
          to return for this request. If you  have  more  XssMatchSet  objects
          than  the  number  you  specify  for Limit , the response includes a
          NextMarker value that you can use to get another batch of Rules .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more  XssMatchSet objects than the number that you spec-
          ified  for  Limit in the request, the response includes a NextMarker
          value. To list more XssMatchSet  objects,  submit  another  ListXss-
          MatchSets  request,  and  specify  the  NextMarker  value  from  the
          response in the NextMarker value in the next request.

       XssMatchSets -> (list)
          An array of  XssMatchSetSummary objects.

                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              The Id and Name of an XssMatchSet .

              XssMatchSetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for an XssMatchSet .  You  use  XssMatch-
                 SetId  to  get  information about a XssMatchSet (see  GetXss-
                 MatchSet ), update an XssMatchSet (see  UpdateXssMatchSet  ),
                 insert  an  XssMatchSet into a Rule or delete one from a Rule
                 (see  UpdateRule ), and delete an XssMatchSet  from  AWS  WAF
                 (see  DeleteXssMatchSet ).
                     XssMatchSetId  is  returned  by  CreateXssMatchSet and by
                     ListXssMatchSets .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the XssMatchSet , if any, specified by Id .
