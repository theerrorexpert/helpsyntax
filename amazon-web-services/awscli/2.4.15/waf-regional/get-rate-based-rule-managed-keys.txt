DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of IP addresses currently being blocked by the   Rate-
       BasedRule  that is specified by the RuleId . The maximum number of man-
       aged keys that will be blocked is 10,000. If more than 10,000 addresses
       exceed the rate limit, the 10,000 addresses with the highest rates will
       be blocked.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rate-based-rule-managed-keys
          --rule-id <value>
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-id (string)
          The RuleId of the  RateBasedRule for which you want to get a list of
          ManagedKeys  .  RuleId  is  returned  by  CreateRateBasedRule and by
          ListRateBasedRules .

       --next-marker (string)
          A null value and not currently used. Do not  include  this  in  your
          request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ManagedKeys -> (list)
          An array of IP addresses that currently are blocked by the specified
          RateBasedRule .

          (string)

       NextMarker -> (string)
          A null value and not currently used.
