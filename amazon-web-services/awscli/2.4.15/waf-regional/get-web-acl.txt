DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  WebACL that is specified by WebACLId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-web-acl
          --web-acl-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --web-acl-id (string)
          The WebACLId of the  WebACL  that  you  want  to  get.  WebACLId  is
          returned by  CreateWebACL and by  ListWebACLs .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WebACL -> (structure)
          Information  about  the   WebACL that you specified in the GetWebACL
          request. For more information, see the following topics:

          o WebACL : Contains DefaultAction , MetricName , Name , an array  of
            Rule objects, and WebACLId

          o DefaultAction (Data type is  WafAction ): Contains Type

          o Rules  : Contains an array of ActivatedRule objects, which contain
            Action , Priority , and RuleId

          o Action : Contains Type

          WebACLId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a WebACL  .  You  use  WebACLId  to  get
              information  about  a  WebACL (see  GetWebACL ), update a WebACL
              (see  UpdateWebACL ), and delete a  WebACL  from  AWS  WAF  (see
              DeleteWebACL ).
                 WebACLId is returned by  CreateWebACL and by  ListWebACLs .

          Name -> (string)
              A  friendly name or description of the WebACL . You can't change
              the name of a WebACL after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A friendly name or description for the metrics for this WebACL .
              The  name  can  contain  only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z,
              0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one.  It  can't
              contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, includ-
              ing "All" and  "Default_Action."  You  can't  change  MetricName
              after you create the WebACL .

          DefaultAction -> (structure)
              The  action  to  perform  if  none of the Rules contained in the
              WebACL match. The action is specified by the  WafAction  object.

              Type -> (string)
                 Specifies  how  you  want AWS WAF to respond to requests that
                 match the settings in a Rule .  Valid  settings  include  the
                 following:

                 o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

                 o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

                 o COUNT  :  AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that
                   match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then  con-
                   tinues  to  inspect  the web request based on the remaining
                   rules in the web ACL.  You  can't  specify  COUNT  for  the
                   default action for a WebACL .

          Rules -> (list)
              An  array  that  contains the action for each Rule in a WebACL ,
              the priority of the Rule , and the ID of the Rule .

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 The ActivatedRule object in an  UpdateWebACL  request  speci-
                 fies  a  Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority
                 of the Rule in the WebACL , and the action that you want  AWS
                 WAF  to  take  when  a  web request matches the Rule (ALLOW ,
                 BLOCK , or COUNT ).

                 To specify whether to insert or  delete  a  Rule  ,  use  the
                 Action parameter in the  WebACLUpdate data type.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  order  in which the Rules in a WebACL are
                     evaluated. Rules with a  lower  value  for  Priority  are
                     evaluated  before  Rules  with  a higher value. The value
                     must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to  a
                     WebACL , the values don't need to be consecutive.

                 RuleId -> (string)
                     The RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more infor-
                     mation about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a  Rule  (see
                     UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one
                     from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from
                     AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).
                        RuleId  is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

                 Action -> (structure)
                     Specifies the action that CloudFront  or  AWS  WAF  takes
                     when  a  web request matches the conditions in the Rule .
                     Valid values for Action include the following:

                     o ALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested  object.

                     o BLOCK  :  CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbid-
                       den) status code.

                     o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of  requests  that
                       match  the conditions in the rule and then continues to
                       inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in
                       the web ACL.
                        ActivatedRule|OverrideAction  applies only when updat-
                        ing or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this  case,
                        you  do  not  use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other
                        update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used  instead
                        of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies  how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests
                        that match the settings in a  Rule  .  Valid  settings
                        include the following:

                        o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

                        o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

                        o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests
                          that match all of the conditions in  the  rule.  AWS
                          WAF  then continues to inspect the web request based
                          on the remaining rules in the  web  ACL.  You  can't
                          specify  COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .

                 OverrideAction -> (structure)
                     Use the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .

                     Any rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a  request.
                     If  you  set  the  OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup
                     will block a request if any individual rule in the  Rule-
                     Group matches the request and is configured to block that
                     request. However if you first want to test the  RuleGroup
                     ,  set  the  OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will
                     then override any block action  specified  by  individual
                     rules  contained  within  the  group. Instead of blocking
                     matching requests, those requests will  be  counted.  You
                     can  view  a record of counted requests using  GetSample-
                     dRequests .
                        ActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when  updat-
                        ing  or  adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case
                        you do not use ActivatedRule|Action .  For  all  other
                        update  requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead
                        of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .

                     Type -> (string)
                        COUNT overrides the action specified by the individual
                        rule  within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule's
                        action will take place.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The rule type, either REGULAR , as  defined  by   Rule  ,
                     RATE_BASED , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as
                     defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR.  Although
                     this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a
                     RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without  setting  the  type,
                     the   UpdateWebACL  request will fail because the request
                     tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID,  which
                     does not exist.

                 ExcludedRules -> (list)
                     An  array  of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is
                     applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a  Rule-
                     Group .

                     Sometimes  it  is  necessary  to troubleshoot rule groups
                     that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives).
                     One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific
                     rule within the rule group that is blocking  the  legiti-
                     mate  traffic  and then disable (exclude) that particular
                     rule. You can exclude  rules  from  both  your  own  rule
                     groups  and  AWS  Marketplace  rule groups that have been
                     associated with a web ACL.

                     Specifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from
                     the  rule  group.  Rather,  it changes the action for the
                     rules to  COUNT  .  Therefore,  requests  that  match  an
                     ExcludedRule  are  counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup
                     owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule  .

                     If  you  want  to exclude rules from a rule group that is
                     already associated with a web ACL, perform the  following
                     steps:

                     o Use  the  AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules
                       that you want to exclude. For  more  information  about
                       the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .

                     o Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

                       o The first action deletes the existing rule group from
                         the web ACL. That is, in the   UpdateWebACL  request,
                         the   first   Updates:Action  should  be  DELETE  and
                         Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group
                         that contains the rules that you want to exclude.

                       o The  second  action  inserts the same rule group back
                         in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the
                         second    Updates:Action    should    be   INSERT   ,
                         Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group
                         that  you just removed, and ExcludedRules should con-
                         tain the rules that you want to exclude.
