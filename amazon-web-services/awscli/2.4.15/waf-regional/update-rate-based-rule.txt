DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  Predicate objects in a rule and updates  the  Rate-
       Limit in the rule.

       Each  Predicate  object identifies a predicate, such as a  ByteMatchSet
       or an  IPSet , that specifies the web requests that you want  to  block
       or  count.  The  RateLimit  specifies the number of requests every five
       minutes that triggers the rule.

       If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule , a request  must
       match  all  the  predicates  and  exceed the RateLimit to be counted or
       blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a  RateBasedRule
       :

       o An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32

       o A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header

       Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.

       You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to
       block requests that satisfy the rule. For a request to be  blocked,  it
       must  come  from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in
       the request must contain the value  BadBot  .  Further,  requests  that
       match  these  two  conditions  much  be received at a rate of more than
       1,000 every five minutes. If the rate drops below this limit,  AWS  WAF
       no longer blocks the requests.

       As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular
       page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to  a  Rate-
       BasedRule :

       o A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI

       o A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH

       o A TargetString of login

       Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.

       By  adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL , you could limit requests to
       your login page without affecting the rest of your site.

       --rule-id (string)
          The RuleId of the RateBasedRule that you want to update.  RuleId  is
          returned by CreateRateBasedRule and by  ListRateBasedRules .

          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --updates (list)
          An  array  of  RuleUpdate  objects  that  you want to insert into or
          delete from a  RateBasedRule .

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              Specifies a Predicate (such as an IPSet ) and indicates  whether
              you want to add it to a Rule or delete it from a Rule .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specify  INSERT  to add a Predicate to a Rule . Use DELETE to
                 remove a Predicate from a Rule .

              Predicate -> (structure)
                 The ID of the Predicate (such as an IPSet ) that you want  to
                 add to a Rule .

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or count requests based on the settings in the  specified
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet  .  For  example,  if an IPSet includes the IP
                     address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or block requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a request based on the negation of the  settings  in  the
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet  .  For  example,  if an IPSet includes the IP
                     address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow, block, or  count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatch or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a predicate in a Rule ,  such  as
                     ByteMatchSetId  or  IPSetId  .  The ID is returned by the
                     corresponding Create or List command.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action=string,Predicate={Negated=boolean,Type=string,DataId=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": "INSERT"|"DELETE",
              "Predicate": {
                "Negated": true|false,
                "Type": "IPMatch"|"ByteMatch"|"SqlInjectionMatch"|"GeoMatch"|"SizeConstraint"|"XssMatch"|"RegexMatch",
                "DataId": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --rate-limit (long)
          The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the
          field specified by the RateKey , allowed in a five-minute period. If
          the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and  the  other  predi-
          cates  specified  in  the  rule  are  also met, AWS WAF triggers the
          action that is specified for this rule.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you  used  to  submit  the  UpdateRateBasedRule
          request.  You  can  also  use  this value to query the status of the
          request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
