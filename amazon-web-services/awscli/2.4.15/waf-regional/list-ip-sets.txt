DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  IPSetSummary objects in the response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-ip-sets
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response that  allows  you
          to list another group of IPSets . For the second and subsequent Lis-
          tIPSets requests, specify the value of NextMarker from the  previous
          response to get information about another batch of IPSets .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies  the  number  of  IPSet  objects  that you want AWS WAF to
          return for this request. If you have more  IPSet  objects  than  the
          number  you  specify  for Limit , the response includes a NextMarker
          value that you can use to get another batch of IPSet objects.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          To list more IPSet objects, submit another ListIPSets  request,  and
          in  the  next  request  use  the  NextMarker  response  value as the
          NextMarker value.

       IPSets -> (list)
          An array of  IPSetSummary objects.

              IPSetId -> (string)
                 The IPSetId for  an   IPSet  .  You  can  use  IPSetId  in  a
                 GetIPSet  request to get detailed information about an  IPSet
                 .

              Name -> (string)
                 A friendly name or description of  the   IPSet  .  You  can't
