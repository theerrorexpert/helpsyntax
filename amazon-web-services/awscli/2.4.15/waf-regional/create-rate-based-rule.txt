NAME
       create-rate-based-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates a  RateBasedRule . The RateBasedRule  contains  a  RateLimit  ,
       which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from
       a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The RateBasedRule  also
       contains  the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates
       that identify the requests that you want to count  or  block  if  these
       requests exceed the RateLimit .

       If  you  add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule , a request not
       only must exceed the RateLimit , but it also must match all the  condi-
       tions  to  be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the fol-
       lowing to a RateBasedRule :

       o An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32

       o A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header

       Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.

       You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to
       block  requests  that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to
       be blocked, it must  come  from  the  IP  address  192.0.2.44  and  the
       User-Agent  header  in the request must contain the value BadBot . Fur-
       ther, requests that match these two conditions must be  received  at  a
       rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions
       are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests.  If  the
       rate  drops  below  1,000  for  a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer
       blocks the requests.

       As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular
       page  on  your site. To do this, you could add the following to a Rate-
       BasedRule :

       o A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI

       o A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH

       o A TargetString of login

       Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.

       By adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL , you could limit requests  to
       your login page without affecting the rest of your site.

       To create and configure a RateBasedRule , perform the following steps:

       o Create  and  update  the  predicates  that you want to include in the
         rule. For more information, see  CreateByteMatchSet ,  CreateIPSet  ,
         and  CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet .

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateRule request.

       o Submit a CreateRateBasedRule request.

       o Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you  provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateRule request.

       o Submit  an UpdateRateBasedRule request to specify the predicates that
         you want to include in the rule.

       o Create and update a WebACL that contains the RateBasedRule . For more
         information, see  CreateWebACL .

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-rate-based-rule
          --name <value>
          --metric-name <value>
          --rate-key <value>
          --rate-limit <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A friendly name or description of the   RateBasedRule  .  You  can't
          change the name of a RateBasedRule after you create it.

       --metric-name (string)
          A  friendly  name  or description for the metrics for this RateBase-
          dRule . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z,
          0-9),  with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't con-
          tain whitespace or metric names  reserved  for  AWS  WAF,  including
          "All"  and "Default_Action." You can't change the name of the metric
          after you create the RateBasedRule .

       --rate-key (string)
          The field that AWS WAF uses to  determine  if  requests  are  likely
          arriving  from  a single source and thus subject to rate monitoring.
          The only valid value for RateKey is IP . IP indicates that  requests
          that  arrive  from  the same IP address are subject to the RateLimit
          that is specified in the RateBasedRule .

          Possible values:

          o IP

       --rate-limit (long)
          The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the
          field  that  is  specified  by  RateKey  ,  allowed in a five-minute
          period. If the number of requests  exceeds  the  RateLimit  and  the
          other  predicates  specified in the rule are also met, AWS WAF trig-
          gers the action that is specified for this rule.

       --change-token (string)
          The ChangeToken that you  used  to  submit  the  CreateRateBasedRule
          request.  You  can  also  use  this value to query the status of the
          request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .

       --tags (list)
          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has  a  single  set  of endpoints for
                     regional and global use.

              A tag associated with an AWS resource. Tags are key:value  pairs
              that  you  can  use to categorize and manage your resources, for
              purposes like billing. For example, you might set the tag key to
              "customer"  and  the  value  to the customer name or ID. You can
              specify one or more tags to add to each AWS resource, up  to  50
              tags for a resource.

              Tagging  is  only  available through the API, SDKs, and CLI. You
              can't manage or view tags through the AWS WAF  Classic  console.
              You  can  tag  the AWS resources that you manage through AWS WAF
              Classic: web ACLs, rule groups, and rules.

              Key -> (string)

              Value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Rule -> (structure)
          The  RateBasedRule  that  is  returned  in  the  CreateRateBasedRule
          response.

          RuleId -> (string)
              A  unique identifier for a RateBasedRule . You use RuleId to get
              more information about a RateBasedRule (see  GetRateBasedRule ),
              update  a  RateBasedRule  (see   UpdateRateBasedRule ), insert a
              RateBasedRule into a WebACL or delete one  from  a  WebACL  (see
              UpdateWebACL  ),  or  delete  a  RateBasedRule from AWS WAF (see
              DeleteRateBasedRule ).

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description for a RateBasedRule .  You  can't
              change the name of a RateBasedRule after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A  friendly  name or description for the metrics for a RateBase-
              dRule . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters  (A-Z,
              a-z,  0-9),  with  maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It
              can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for  AWS  WAF,
              including  "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name
              of the metric after you create the RateBasedRule .

          MatchPredicates -> (list)
              The Predicates object contains one Predicate  element  for  each
              ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet , or  SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you
              want to include in a RateBasedRule .

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet
                 ,   XssMatchSet  ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , and  Size-
                 ConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a Rule and, for
                 each  object,  indicates  whether you want to negate the set-
                 tings, for example, requests that do NOT originate  from  the
                 IP address 192.0.2.44.

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or count requests based on the settings in the  specified
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet  .  For  example,  if an IPSet includes the IP
                     address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or block requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a request based on the negation of the  settings  in  the
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet  .  For  example,  if an IPSet includes the IP
                     address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow, block, or  count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatch or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a predicate in a Rule ,  such  as
                     ByteMatchSetId  or  IPSetId  .  The ID is returned by the
                     corresponding Create or List command.

          RateKey -> (string)
              The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are  likely
              arriving from single source and thus subject to rate monitoring.
              The only valid value for RateKey  is  IP  .  IP  indicates  that
              requests  arriving  from  the same IP address are subject to the
              RateLimit that is specified in the RateBasedRule .

          RateLimit -> (long)
              The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in
              the  field  specified  by the RateKey , allowed in a five-minute
              period. If the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and  the
              other  predicates  specified  in  the rule are also met, AWS WAF
              triggers the action that is specified for this rule.

       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you  used  to  submit  the  CreateRateBasedRule
          request.  You  can  also  use  this value to query the status of the
          request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
