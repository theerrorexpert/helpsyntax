PUT-BUCKET-LOGGING()                                      PUT-BUCKET-LOGGING()



NAME
       put-bucket-logging -

DESCRIPTION
       Set  the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for
       who can view and modify the logging parameters. All logs are  saved  to
       buckets in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source bucket. To
       set the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

       The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You
       use  the  Grantee  request element to grant access to other people. The
       Permissions request element specifies the kind of  access  the  grantee
       has to the logs.

       WARNING:
              If  the  target  bucket  for  log delivery uses the bucket owner
              enforced setting for S3 Object  Ownership,  you  can't  use  the
              Grantee  request  element to grant access to others. Permissions
              can only be granted using policies. For  more  information,  see
              Permissions for server access log delivery in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

          Grantee Values

       You can specify the person (grantee) to whom  you're  assigning  access
       rights (using request elements) in the following ways:

       o By           the           person's           ID:            <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesE-
         mail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>   DisplayName is optional and ignored
         in the request.

       o By               Email               address:                <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:type="Ama-
         zonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAd-
         dress></Grantee>   The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser  and,
         in  a  response  to  a GET Object acl request, appears as the Canoni-
         calUser.

       o By                           URI:                            <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazon-
         aws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>

       To enable logging, you use LoggingEnabled and its children request ele-
       ments. To disable logging, you use an empty BucketLoggingStatus request
       element:
          <BucketLoggingStatus  xmlns="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01"
          />

       Logging in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       For  more  information  about creating a bucket, see CreateBucket . For
       more information about returning the logging status of  a  bucket,  see

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-logging
          --bucket <value>
          --bucket-logging-status <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to set the logging parameters.

       --bucket-logging-status (structure)
          Container for logging status information.

          LoggingEnabled -> (structure)
              Describes  where  logs  are stored and the prefix that Amazon S3
              assigns to all log object keys for a bucket. For  more  informa-
              tion, see PUT Bucket logging in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

              TargetBucket -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store server
                 access logs. You can have your logs delivered to  any  bucket
                 that you own, including the same bucket that is being logged.
                 You can also configure multiple buckets to deliver their logs
                 to  the same target bucket. In this case, you should choose a
                 different TargetPrefix for each source  bucket  so  that  the
                 delivered log files can be distinguished by key.

              TargetGrants -> (list)
                 Container for granting information.

                 Buckets that use the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
                 Ownership don't support target grants. For more  information,
                 see  Permissions for server access log delivery in the Amazon
                 S3 User Guide .

                     Container for granting information.

                     Buckets that use the bucket owner  enforced  setting  for
                     Object  Ownership  don't  support target grants. For more
                     information, see Permissions server access  log  delivery
                     in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 A prefix for all log object keys. If you store log files from
                 multiple Amazon S3 buckets in a single bucket, you can use  a
                 prefix to distinguish which log files came from which bucket.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LoggingEnabled": {
              "TargetBucket": "string",
              "TargetGrants": [
                {
                  "Grantee": {
                    "DisplayName": "string",
                    "EmailAddress": "string",
                    "ID": "string",
                    "Type": "CanonicalUser"|"AmazonCustomerByEmail"|"Group",
                    "URI": "string"
                  },
                  "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"|"READ"|"WRITE"
                }
                ...
              ],
              "TargetPrefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash of the PutBucketLogging request body.

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face  (CLI)  or  Amazon  Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated
          automatically.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To set bucket policy logging

       The following put-bucket-logging example sets the  logging  policy  for
       MyBucket. First, grant the logging service principal permission in your
       bucket policy using the put-bucket-policy command.

          aws s3api put-bucket-policy \
              --bucket MyBucket \
              --policy file://policy.json

       Contents of policy.json:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Sid": "S3ServerAccessLogsPolicy",
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {"Service": "logging.s3.amazonaws.com"},
                      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/Logs/*",
                      "Condition": {
                          "ArnLike": {"aws:SourceARN": "arn:aws:s3:::SOURCE-BUCKET-NAME"},
                          "StringEquals": {"aws:SourceAccount": "SOURCE-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID"}
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       To apply the logging policy, use put-bucket-logging.

          aws s3api put-bucket-logging \
              --bucket MyBucket \
              --bucket-logging-status file://logging.json

       Contents of logging.json:

          {
               "LoggingEnabled": {
                   "TargetBucket": "MyBucket",
                   "TargetPrefix": "Logs/"
               }
           }

       NOTE:
          The put-bucket-policy command is required to grant s3:PutObject per-
          missions to the logging service principal.

       For more information, see Amazon S3 Server Access Logging in the Amazon
       S3 User Guide.

       Example 2: To set a bucket policy for logging access to only  a  single
       user

       The  following  put-bucket-logging  example sets the logging policy for
       MyBucket. The AWS user bob@example.com will have full control over  the
       log  files,  and no one else has any access. First, grant S3 permission
       with put-bucket-acl.

          aws s3api put-bucket-acl \
              --bucket MyBucket \
              --grant-write URI=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery \
              --grant-read-acp URI=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery

       Then apply the logging policy using put-bucket-logging.

          aws s3api put-bucket-logging \
              --bucket MyBucket \
              --bucket-logging-status file://logging.json

       Contents of logging.json:

          {
              "LoggingEnabled": {
                  "TargetBucket": "MyBucket",
                  "TargetPrefix": "MyBucketLogs/",
                  "TargetGrants": [
                      {
                          "Grantee": {
                              "Type": "AmazonCustomerByEmail",
                              "EmailAddress": "bob@example.com"
                          },
                          "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

       NOTE:
          the put-bucket-acl command is required to grant  S3's  log  delivery
          system the necessary permissions (write and read-acp permissions).

       For more information, see Amazon S3 Server Access Logging in the Amazon
       S3 Developer Guide.
