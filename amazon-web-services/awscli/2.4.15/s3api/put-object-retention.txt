PUT-OBJECT-RETENTION()                                  PUT-OBJECT-RETENTION()



NAME
       put-object-retention -

DESCRIPTION
       Places  an Object Retention configuration on an object. For more infor-
       mation, see Locking Objects . Users or accounts require  the  s3:PutOb-
       jectRetention permission in order to place an Object Retention configu-
       ration on  objects.  Bypassing  a  Governance  Retention  configuration
       requires the s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permission.

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
          Permissions

       When  the  Object  Lock  retention  mode is set to compliance, you need
       s3:PutObjectRetention and s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permissions. For
       other  requests to PutObjectRetention , only s3:PutObjectRetention per-
       missions are required.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name that contains the object  you  want  to  apply  this
          Object Retention configuration to.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --key (string)
          The  key  name  for  the  object  that you want to apply this Object
          Retention configuration to.

       --retention (structure)
          The container element for the Object Retention configuration.

          Mode -> (string)
              Indicates the Retention mode for the specified object.

          RetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)
              The date on which this Object Lock Retention will expire.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Mode=string,RetainUntilDate=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Mode": "GOVERNANCE"|"COMPLIANCE",
            "RetainUntilDate": timestamp
          }

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket  owners  need  not  specify this parameter in their
          requests. For information about downloading objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --version-id (string)
          The version ID for the object that you want  to  apply  this  Object
          Retention configuration to.

       --bypass-governance-retention     |    --no-bypass-governance-retention
       (boolean)
          Indicates whether this action should bypass Governance-mode restric-
          tions.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash for the request body.

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs,  this  field  is  calculated
          automatically.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following  put-object-retention  example  sets an object retention
       configuration for the specified object until 2025-01-01.

          aws s3api put-object-retention \
              --bucket my-bucket-with-object-lock \
              --key doc1.rtf \
              --retention '{ "Mode": "GOVERNANCE", "RetainUntilDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00" }'

       This command produces no output.

          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.
