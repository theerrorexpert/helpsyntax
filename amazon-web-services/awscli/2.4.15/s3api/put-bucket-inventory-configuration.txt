PUT-BUCKET-INVENTORY-CONFIGURATION()      PUT-BUCKET-INVENTORY-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-inventory-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       This  implementation  of the PUT action adds an inventory configuration
       (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket.  You  can  have  up  to
       1,000 inventory configurations per bucket.

       Amazon  S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket
       on a daily or weekly basis, and the results are  published  to  a  flat
       file.  The  bucket that is inventoried is called the source bucket, and
       the bucket where the inventory flat file is stored is called the desti-
       nation  bucket.  The  destination bucket must be in the same Amazon Web
       Services Region as the source bucket.

       When you configure an inventory for a source bucket,  you  specify  the
       destination  bucket  where  you  want  the  inventory to be stored, and
       whether to generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also config-
       ure what object metadata to include and whether to inventory all object
       versions or only current versions. For more information, see Amazon  S3
       Inventory in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

       WARNING:
          You  must  create a bucket policy on the destination bucket to grant
          permissions to Amazon S3 to write  objects  to  the  bucket  in  the
          defined  location.  For  an example policy, see Granting Permissions
          for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis .

       To use this  operation,  you  must  have  permissions  to  perform  the
       s3:PutInventoryConfiguration  action. The bucket owner has this permis-
       sion by default and can grant  this  permission  to  others.  For  more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions  to  Your  Amazon  S3
       Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

       o HTTP 400 Bad Request Error

         o Code: InvalidArgument

         o Cause: Invalid Argument

       o HTTP 400 Bad Request Error

         o Code: TooManyConfigurations

         o Cause:  You  are  attempting to create a new configuration but have

       o HTTP 403 Forbidden Error

         o Code: AccessDenied

         o Cause: You are not the owner of the specified bucket, or you do not

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To set an inventory configuration for a bucket

       The following put-bucket-inventory-configuration example sets a  weekly
       ORC-formatted inventory report for the bucket my-bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-inventory-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --id 1 \
              --inventory-configuration '{"Destination": { "S3BucketDestination": { "AccountId": "123456789012", "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket", "Format": "ORC" }}, "IsEnabled": true, "Id": "1", "IncludedObjectVersions": "Current", "Schedule": { "Frequency": "Weekly" }}'

       This command produces no output.

       Example 1: To set an inventory configuration for a bucket

       The  following  put-bucket-inventory-configuration example sets a daily
       CSV-formatted inventory report for the bucket my-bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-inventory-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --id 2 \
              --inventory-configuration '{"Destination": { "S3BucketDestination": { "AccountId": "123456789012", "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket", "Format": "CSV" }}, "IsEnabled": true, "Id": "2", "IncludedObjectVersions": "Current", "Schedule": { "Frequency": "Daily" }}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
