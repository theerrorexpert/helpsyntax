HEAD-OBJECT()                                                    HEAD-OBJECT()



NAME
       head-object -

DESCRIPTION
       The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the
       object itself. This action is useful if you're only  interested  in  an
       object's  metadata.  To  use  HEAD,  you  must  have READ access to the
       object.

       A HEAD request has the same options as a GET action on an  object.  The
       response  is  identical  to  the  GET  response except that there is no
       response body. Because of this, if the HEAD request generates an error,
       it  returns  a  generic  404 Not Found or 403 Forbidden code. It is not
       possible to retrieve the exact exception beyond these error codes.

       If you encrypt an object by  using  server-side  encryption  with  cus-
       tomer-provided  encryption  keys  (SSE-C)  when you store the object in
       Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata  from  the  object,  you
       must use the following headers:

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

       For  more  information  about  SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using
       Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) .

       NOTE:

          o Encryption request headers,  like  x-amz-server-side-encryption  ,
            should   not  be  sent  for  GET  requests  if  your  object  uses
            server-side encryption with  KMS  keys  (SSE-KMS)  or  server-side
            encryption with Amazon S3managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your
            object does use these  types  of  keys,  youll  get  an  HTTP  400
            BadRequest error.

          o The  last  modified  property in this case is the creation date of
            the object.

       Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information,  see
       Common Request Headers .

       Consider the following when using request headers:

       o Consideration  1   If  both  of  the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since
         headers are present in the request as follows:

         o If-Match condition evaluates to true , and;

         o If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ;

       Then Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.

       o Consideration 2  If both of the If-None-Match  and  If-Modified-Since
         headers are present in the request as follows:

         o If-None-Match condition evaluates to false , and;

         o If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true ;

       Then Amazon S3 returns the 304 Not Modified response code.

       For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .
          Permissions

       You  need  the  relevant  read  object (or version) permission for this
       operation. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy
       . If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns
       depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.

       o If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on  the  bucket,  Amazon  S3
         returns an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.

       o If  you  dont have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an
         HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the object.

          When using this  action  with  an  access  point,  you  must  direct
          requests  to  the  access  point hostname. The access point hostname
          takes the form AccessPointName  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through
          the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access  point  ARN  in
          place  of  the  bucket name. For more information about access point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --if-match (string)
          Return  the  object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the
          one specified, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).

       --if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Return the object only if it has been modified since  the  specified
          time, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).

       --if-none-match (string)
          Return  the  object  only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from
          the one specified, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).

       --if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Return the object only if it has not been modified since the  speci-
          fied time, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).

       --key (string)
          The object key.

       --range (string)
          Because  HeadObject  returns  only  the metadata for an object, this
          parameter has no effect.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting  the  object  (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and  then
          it  is  discarded;  Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The
          key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in  the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not  specify  this  parameter  in  their
          requests.  For  information about downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --part-number (integer)
          Part  number  of  the  object being read. This is a positive integer
          between 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged'  HEAD  request
          for  the  part specified. Useful querying about the size of the part
          and the number of parts in this object.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command retrieves metadata for  an  object  in  a  bucket
       named my-bucket:

          aws s3api head-object --bucket my-bucket --key index.html

       Output:

          {
              "AcceptRanges": "bytes",
              "ContentType": "text/html",
              "LastModified": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 18:19:14 GMT",
              "ContentLength": 77,
              "VersionId": "null",
              "ETag": "\"30a6ec7e1a9ad79c203d05a589c8b400\"",
              "Metadata": {}
          }

OUTPUT
       DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false)
          a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not  appear  in
          the response.

       AcceptRanges -> (string)
          Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

       Expiration -> (string)
          If  the  object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle),
          the response includes this header. It includes the  expiry-date  and
          rule-id key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The
          value of the rule-id is URL encoded.

       Restore -> (string)
          If the object is an archived object (an object whose  storage  class
          is GLACIER), the response includes this header if either the archive
          restoration is in progress (see RestoreObject or an archive copy  is
          already restored.

          If  an  archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates
          when Amazon S3 is scheduled to delete the object copy. For example:
              x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Fri, 21 Dec
              2012 00:00:00 GMT"

          If  the  object  restoration  is in progress, the header returns the
          value ongoing-request="true" .

          For more information  about  archiving  objects,  see  Transitioning
          Objects: General Considerations .

       ArchiveStatus -> (string)
          The archive state of the head object.

       LastModified -> (timestamp)
          Creation date of the object.

       ContentLength -> (long)
          Size of the body in bytes.

       ETag -> (string)
          An  ETag  is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a spe-
          cific version of a resource found at a URL.

       MissingMeta -> (integer)
          This is set to the  number  of  metadata  entries  not  returned  in
          x-amz-meta  headers. This can happen if you create metadata using an
          API like SOAP that supports more flexible  metadata  than  the  REST
          API.  For  example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values
          are not legal HTTP headers.

       VersionId -> (string)
          Version of the object.

       CacheControl -> (string)
          Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

       ContentDisposition -> (string)
          Specifies presentational information for the object.

       ContentEncoding -> (string)
          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
          thus  what  decoding  mechanisms  must  be  applied  to  obtain  the
          media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       ContentLanguage -> (string)
          The language the content is in.

       ContentType -> (string)
          A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

       Expires -> (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

       WebsiteRedirectLocation -> (string)
          If the bucket is configured as a  website,  redirects  requests  for
          this  object  to another object in the same bucket or to an external
          URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the  object  meta-
          data.

       ServerSideEncryption -> (string)
          If  the object is stored using server-side encryption either with an
          Amazon Web Services KMS key or an Amazon S3-managed encryption  key,
          the  response includes this header with the value of the server-side
          encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for
          example, AES256, aws:kms).

       Metadata -> (map)
          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       SSECustomerAlgorithm -> (string)
          If  server-side  encryption  with a customer-provided encryption key
          was requested, the response will include this header confirming  the
          encryption algorithm used.

       SSECustomerKeyMD5 -> (string)
          If  server-side  encryption  with a customer-provided encryption key
          was requested, the response will  include  this  header  to  provide
          round-trip  message  integrity verification of the customer-provided
          encryption key.

       SSEKMSKeyId -> (string)
          If present, specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key  Manage-
          ment  Service  (Amazon  Web Services KMS) symmetric customer managed
          key that was used for the object.

       BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the object uses an S3 Bucket Key  for  server-side
          encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS (SSE-KMS).

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Provides  storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns
          this header for all objects except for  S3  Standard  storage  class
          objects.

          For more information, see Storage Classes .

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.

       ReplicationStatus -> (string)
          Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves  a  bucket
          that is either a source or a destination in a replication rule.

          In  replication,  you  have  a  source bucket on which you configure
          replication and destination bucket or buckets where Amazon S3 stores
          object  replicas.  When you request an object (GetObject ) or object
          metadata (HeadObject ) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the
          x-amz-replication-status header in the response as follows:

          o If  requesting  an  object  from the source bucket  Amazon S3 will
            return the x-amz-replication-status header if the object  in  your
            request  is eligible for replication. For example, suppose that in
            your replication configuration, you specify object prefix  TaxDocs
            requesting  Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix TaxDocs
            . Any objects you upload with this key name  prefix,  for  example
            TaxDocs/document1.pdf  ,  are  eligible  for  replication. For any
            object request with this key name prefix, Amazon  S3  will  return
            the  x-amz-replication-status header with value PENDING, COMPLETED
            or FAILED indicating object replication status.

          o If requesting an object from a destination bucket  Amazon S3  will
            return  the  x-amz-replication-status header with value REPLICA if
            the object in your request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and
            there is no replica modification replication in progress.

          o When  replicating  objects  to  multiple  destination  buckets the
            x-amz-replication-status header acts differently.  The  header  of
            the  source  object  will  only  return  a value of COMPLETED when
            replication is successful to all  destinations.  The  header  will
            remain  at  value  PENDING until replication has completed for all
            destinations. If one or more destinations  fails  replication  the
            header will return FAILED.

          For more information, see Replication .

       PartsCount -> (integer)
          The count of parts this object has.

       ObjectLockMode -> (string)
          The Object Lock mode, if any, that's in effect for this object. This
          header is only returned if the requester has the  s3:GetObjectReten-
          tion  permission.  For  more  information  about S3 Object Lock, see
          Object Lock .

       ObjectLockRetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the Object  Lock  retention  period  expires.
          This  header  is only returned if the requester has the s3:GetObjec-
          tRetention permission.

       ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus -> (string)
          Specifies whether a legal hold is in effect for  this  object.  This
          header  is only returned if the requester has the s3:GetObjectLegal-
          Hold permission. This header is not returned if the  specified  ver-
          sion  of  this  object  has never had a legal hold applied. For more
          information about S3 Object Lock, see Object Lock .



                                                                 HEAD-OBJECT()
