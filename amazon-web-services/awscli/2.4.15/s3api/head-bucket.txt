HEAD-BUCKET()                                                    HEAD-BUCKET()



NAME
       head-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       This action is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have per-
       mission to access it. The action returns a 200 OK if the bucket  exists
       and you have permission to access it.

       If  the  bucket  does not exist or you do not have permission to access
       it, the HEAD request returns a generic 404 Not Found or  403  Forbidden
       code.  A  message  body  is  not  included, so you cannot determine the
       exception beyond these error codes.

       To use this  operation,  you  must  have  permissions  to  perform  the
       s3:ListBucket  action.  The bucket owner has this permission by default
       and can grant this permission to others.  For  more  information  about
       permissions,  see  Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations
       and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       To use this API against an access point, you must provide the alias  of
       the  access  point  in  place  of the bucket name or specify the access
       point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to
       the  access  point  hostname.  The access point hostname takes the form
       AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com.     When
       using the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the ARN in place of the
       bucket name. For more information see, Using access points .

SYNOPSIS
            head-bucket
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

          When using this  action  with  an  access  point,  you  must  direct
          requests  to  the  access  point hostname. The access point hostname
          takes the form AccessPointName  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through
          the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access  point  ARN  in
          place  of  the  bucket name. For more information about access point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command verifies access to a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api head-bucket --bucket my-bucket

       If  the bucket exists and you have access to it, no output is returned.
       Otherwise, an error message will be shown. For example:

          A client error (404) occurred when calling the HeadBucket operation: Not Found

OUTPUT
       None



                                                                 HEAD-BUCKET()
