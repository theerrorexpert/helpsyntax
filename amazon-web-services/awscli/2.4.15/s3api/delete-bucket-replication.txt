DELETE-BUCKET-REPLICATION()                        DELETE-BUCKET-REPLICATION()



NAME
       delete-bucket-replication -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the replication configuration from the bucket.

       To  use  this  operation,  you  must  have  permissions  to perform the
       s3:PutReplicationConfiguration action. The bucket owner has these  per-
       missions  by  default  and can grant it to others. For more information
       about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Opera-
       tions and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       NOTE:
          It  can take a while for the deletion of a replication configuration
          to fully propagate.

       For information about replication configuration, see Replication in the
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

       The following operations are related to DeleteBucketReplication :

       o PutBucketReplication

       o GetBucketReplication

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bucket-replication
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command deletes a replication configuration from a bucket
       named my-bucket:

          aws s3api delete-bucket-replication --bucket my-bucket

OUTPUT
       None
