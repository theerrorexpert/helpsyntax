PUT-OBJECT-ACL()                                              PUT-OBJECT-ACL()



NAME
       put-object-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       Uses  the  acl subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permis-
       sions for a new or existing object in  an  S3  bucket.  You  must  have
       WRITE_ACP permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information,
       see What permissions can I grant? in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the  ACL  on
       an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if
       you have an existing application that updates a bucket  ACL  using  the
       request  body, you can continue to use that approach. For more informa-
       tion, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview  in  the  Amazon  S3  User
       Guide .

       WARNING:
              If  your  bucket  uses  the bucket owner enforced setting for S3
              Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permis-
              sions.  You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and
              the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail  and
              return the AccessControlListNotSupported error code. Requests to
              read  ACLs  are  still  supported.  For  more  information,  see
              Controlling object ownership in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Access Permissions

       You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

       o Specify  a  canned  ACL  with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3
         supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each  canned
         ACL  has  a  predefined  set of grantees and permissions. Specify the
         canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-ac l. If you use  this  header,
         you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request.
         For more information, see Canned ACL .

       o Specify access permissions explicitly  with  the  x-amz-grant-read  ,
         x-amz-grant-read-acp      ,      x-amz-grant-write-acp      ,     and
         x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you spec-
         ify  explicit  access  permissions  and grantees (Amazon Web Services
         accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you
         use  these  ACL-specific  headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to
         set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that
         Amazon  S3  supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Con-
         trol List (ACL) Overview . You specify each grantee as  a  type=value
         pair, where the type is one of the following:

         o id   if  the  value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon
           Web Services account

         o uri  if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

         o emailAddress  if the value specified is the  email  address  of  an
           Amazon Web Services account

         NOTE:
                Using  email  addresses to specify a grantee is only supported
                in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:

                   o US East (N. Virginia)

                   o US West (N. California)

                   o US West (Oregon)

                   o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                   o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                   o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                   o Europe (Ireland)

                   o South America (So Paulo)

            For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions  and  endpoints,
            see  Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Ref-
            erence.

       For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list  objects
       permission  to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their
       email addresses.
          x-amz-grant-read:      emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com",       emailAd-
          dress="abc@amazon.com"

       You  can  use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explic-
       itly. You cannot do both.
          Grantee Values

       You can specify the person (grantee) to whom  you're  assigning  access
       rights (using request elements) in the following ways:

       o By           the           person's           ID:            <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesE-
         mail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>   DisplayName is optional and ignored
         in the request.

       o By                           URI:                            <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazon-
         aws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>

       o By               Email               address:                <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:type="Ama-
         zonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAd-
         dress>lt;/Grantee>    The  grantee  is  resolved to the CanonicalUser
         and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the Canon-
         icalUser.

       NOTE:
                 Using  email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported
                 in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:

                     o US East (N. Virginia)

                     o US West (N. California)

                     o US West (Oregon)

                     o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                     o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                     o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                     o Europe (Ireland)

                     o South America (So Paulo)

              For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
              see  Regions  and  Endpoints  in the Amazon Web Services General
              Reference.

          Versioning

       The ACL of an object is set at the object version  level.  By  default,
       PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of
       a different version, use the versionId subresource.

       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name that contains the object to which you want to attach
          the ACL.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --content-md5 (string)
          The  base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. This header must
          be used as a message integrity check to verify that the request body
          was not corrupted in transit. For more information, go to RFC 1864.>

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face  (CLI)  or  Amazon  Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated
          automatically.

       --grant-full-control (string)
          Allows grantee the read, write, read ACP, and write ACP  permissions
          on the bucket.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read (string)
          Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-write (string)
          Allows grantee to create new objects in the bucket.

          For  the  bucket  and object owners of existing objects, also allows
          deletions and overwrites of those objects.

       --grant-write-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucket.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --key (string)
          Key for which the PUT action was initiated.

          When using this  action  with  an  access  point,  you  must  direct
          requests  to  the  access  point hostname. The access point hostname
          takes the form AccessPointName  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through
          the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access  point  ARN  in
          place  of  the  bucket name. For more information about access point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not  specify  this  parameter  in  their
          requests.  For  information about downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command grants full control to two AWS users (user1@exam-
       ple.com and user2@example.com) and read permission to everyone:

          aws s3api put-object-acl --bucket MyBucket --key file.txt --grant-full-control emailaddress=user1@example.com,emailaddress=user2@example.com --grant-read uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers

       See
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTacl.html
       for  details  on  custom  ACLs  (the  s3api  ACL  commands,   such   as
       put-object-acl, use the same shorthand argument notation).

OUTPUT
       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.



                                                              PUT-OBJECT-ACL()
