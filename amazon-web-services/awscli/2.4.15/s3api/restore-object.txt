RESTORE-OBJECT()                                              RESTORE-OBJECT()



NAME
       restore-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       This action performs the following types of requests:

       o select - Perform a select query on an archived object

       o restore an archive - Restore an archived object

       To  use  this  operation,  you  must  have  permissions  to perform the
       s3:RestoreObject action.  The  bucket  owner  has  this  permission  by
       default  and  can grant this permission to others. For more information
       about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Opera-
       tions  and  Managing  Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in
       the Amazon S3 User Guide .
          Querying Archives with Select Requests

       You use a select type of request to perform  SQL  queries  on  archived
       objects.  The  archived  objects  that  are being queried by the select
       request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values  (CSV)
       files.  You  can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data
       without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For  an
       overview  about  select  requests, see Querying Archived Objects in the
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

       When making a select request, do the following:

       o Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be
         an  Amazon  S3  bucket  in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the
         bucket that contains the archive object that is  being  queried.  The
         Amazon  Web Services account that initiates the job must have permis-
         sions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify  the  storage  class
         and  encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more
         information about output, see Querying Archived Objects in the Amazon
         S3  User  Guide  . For more information about the S3 structure in the
         request body, see the following:

         o PutObject

         o Managing Access with ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide

         o Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3  User
           Guide

       o Define the SQL expression for the SELECT type of restoration for your
         query in the request body's SelectParameters structure. You  can  use
         expressions like the following examples.

         o The  following  expression  returns  all records from the specified
           object.  SELECT * FROM Object

         o Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in  the
           object,  you  can  specify columns with positional headers.  SELECT
           s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100

         o If you have headers and you  set  the  fileHeaderInfo  in  the  CSV
           structure  in  the request body to USE , you can specify headers in
           the query. (If you set the fileHeaderInfo field  to  IGNORE  ,  the
           first  row  is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal posi-
           tions with header column names.   SELECT s.Id,  s.FirstName,  s.SSN
           FROM S3Object s

       For  more  information  about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore,
       see SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3  Glacier  Select  in  the
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

       When making a select request, you can also do the following:

       o To expedite your queries, specify the Expedited tier. For more infor-
         mation about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.

       o Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input
         object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded
         query results.

       The following are additional important facts about the select feature:

       o The  output  results  are  new  Amazon  S3  objects.  Unlike  archive
         retrievals,  they  are  stored  until  explicitly deleted-manually or
         through a lifecycle policy.

       o You can issue more than one select request  on  the  same  Amazon  S3
         object.  Amazon  S3  doesn't  deduplicate  requests, so avoid issuing
         duplicate requests.

       o Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if  the  object  has  already
         been restored. A select request doesnt return error response 409 .
          Restoring objects

       Objects  that  you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive
       storage class,  and  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  Archive  or  S3  Intelli-
       gent-Tiering  Deep  Archive  tiers are not accessible in real time. For
       objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you  must  first
       initiate  a  restore  request,  and then wait until the object is moved
       into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3  Glacier
       Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request,
       and then wait until a temporary copy of the  object  is  available.  To
       access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration
       (number of days) that you specify.

       To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID.  If
       you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

       When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you  can
       specify  one of the following data access tier options in the Tier ele-
       ment of the request body:

       o
         **
         Expedited ** - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access  your
         data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
         Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives
         are  required.  For  all  but the largest archived objects (250 MB+),
         data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made  available
         within 15 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capac-
         ity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
         retrievals  and  provisioned  capacity  are not available for objects
         stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class  or  S3  Intelli-
         gent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

       o
         **
         Standard  **  -  Standard  retrievals allow you to access any of your
         archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for
         retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard
         retrievals typically finish within 35 hours for objects stored in the
         S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They
         typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier
         Deep  Archive  storage  class  or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive
         tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3  Intelli-
         gent-Tiering.

       o
         **
         Bulk  ** - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3
         Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even  petabytes,  of
         data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 512 hours
         for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage  class  or  S3  Intelli-
         gent-Tiering  Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for
         objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive  storage  class  or  S3
         Intelligent-Tiering  Deep  Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for
         objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

       For more information about archive retrieval  options  and  provisioned
       capacity  for  Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in
       the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed
       to  a  faster  speed while it is in progress. For more information, see
       Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore in  the  Amazon  S3  User
       Guide .

       To  get  the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request.
       Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides  information
       about  the  restoration  status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3
       event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated  or  com-
       pleted. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifica-
       tions in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       After restoring an archived object,  you  can  update  the  restoration
       period  by  reissuing  the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates
       the restoration period relative to the current time  and  charges  only
       for  the  request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update
       the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your  cur-
       rent restore request for the object.

       If  your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes
       an expiration action, the object expiration  overrides  the  life  span
       that  you  specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an
       object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled  to  expire  in  3
       days,  Amazon  S3  deletes  the  object in 3 days. For more information
       about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration  and
       Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon S3 User Guide .
          Responses

       A  successful  action  returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status
       code.

       o If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns  202
         Accepted in the response.

       o If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK in the
         response.
          Special Errors

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name containing the object to restore.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the action was initiated.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

          Container for restore job parameters.

          Days -> (integer)
              Lifetime of the active copy in days. Do not  use  with  restores
              that specify OutputLocation .

              The  Days element is required for regular restores, and must not
              be provided for select requests.

          GlacierJobParameters -> (structure)
              S3 Glacier related parameters pertaining to this job. Do not use
              with restores that specify OutputLocation .

              Tier -> (string)
                 Retrieval tier at which the restore will be processed.

          Type -> (string)
              Type of restore request.

          Tier -> (string)
              Retrieval tier at which the restore will be processed.

          Description -> (string)
              The optional description for the job.

          SelectParameters -> (structure)
              Describes the parameters for Select job types.

              InputSerialization -> (structure)
                 Describes the serialization format of the object.

                 CSV -> (structure)
                     Describes the serialization of a CSV-encoded object.

                     FileHeaderInfo -> (string)
                        Describes the first line of input. Valid values are:

                        o NONE : First line is not a header.

                        o IGNORE  :  First line is a header, but you can't use
                          the header values  to  indicate  the  column  in  an
                          expression. You can use column position (such as _1,
                          _2, ) to  indicate  the  column  (SELECT  s._1  FROM
                          OBJECT s ).

                        o Use  :  First  line is a header, and you can use the
                          header value to identify a column in  an  expression
                          (SELECT "name" FROM OBJECT ).

                     Comments -> (string)
                        A  single character used to indicate that a row should
                        be ignored when the character is present at the  start
                        of that row. You can specify any character to indicate
                        a comment line.

                     QuoteEscapeCharacter -> (string)
                        A single character used  for  escaping  the  quotation
                        mark  character  inside  an already escaped value. For
                        example, the value """ a , b """ is parsed as " a ,  b
                        ".

                     RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                        A single character used to separate individual records
                        in the input. Instead of the default  value,  you  can
                        specify an arbitrary delimiter.

                     FieldDelimiter -> (string)
                        A  single character used to separate individual fields
                        in a record. You can specify an arbitrary delimiter.

                     QuoteCharacter -> (string)
                        A single character used for escaping  when  the  field
                        delimiter  is  part  of the value. For example, if the
                        value is a, b , Amazon S3 wraps this  field  value  in
                        quotation marks, as follows: " a , b " .

                        Type: String

                        Default: "

                        Ancestors: CSV

                     AllowQuotedRecordDelimiter -> (boolean)
                        Specifies  that  CSV  field  values may contain quoted
                        record delimiters and such records should be  allowed.
                        Default value is FALSE. Setting this value to TRUE may
                        lower performance.

                 CompressionType -> (string)
                     Specifies  object's  compression  format.  Valid  values:
                     NONE, GZIP, BZIP2. Default Value: NONE.

                 JSON -> (structure)
                     Specifies JSON as object's input serialization format.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of JSON. Valid values: Document, Lines.

                 Parquet -> (structure)
                     Specifies Parquet as object's input serialization format.

              ExpressionType -> (string)
                 The type of the provided expression (for example, SQL).

              Expression -> (string)
                 The expression that is used to query the object.

              OutputSerialization -> (structure)
                 Describes how the results of the Select job are serialized.

                 CSV -> (structure)
                     Describes  the  serialization   of   CSV-encoded   Select
                     results.

                     QuoteFields -> (string)
                        Indicates whether to use quotation marks around output
                        fields.

                        o ALWAYS :  Always  use  quotation  marks  for  output
                          fields.

                        o ASNEEDED  :  Use  quotation  marks for output fields
                          when needed.

                     QuoteEscapeCharacter -> (string)
                        The single character used for escaping the quote char-
                        acter inside an already escaped value.

                     RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                        A single character used to separate individual records
                        in the output. Instead of the default value,  you  can
                        specify an arbitrary delimiter.

                     FieldDelimiter -> (string)
                        The  value  used  to  separate  individual fields in a
                        record. You can specify an arbitrary delimiter.

                     QuoteCharacter -> (string)
                        A single character used for escaping  when  the  field
                        delimiter  is  part  of the value. For example, if the
                        value is a, b , Amazon S3 wraps this  field  value  in
                        quotation marks, as follows: " a , b " .

                 JSON -> (structure)
                     Specifies  JSON as request's output serialization format.

                     RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                        The value used to separate individual records  in  the
                        output.  If  no  value  is specified, Amazon S3 uses a
                        newline character ('n').

          OutputLocation -> (structure)
              Describes the location where the restore job's output is stored.

              S3 -> (structure)
                 Describes an S3 location that will receive the results of the
                 restore request.

                 BucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the bucket where the restore results will  be
                     placed.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The  prefix  that is prepended to the restore results for

                     EncryptionType -> (string)
                        The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing
                        job   results  in  Amazon  S3  (for  example,  AES256,
                        aws:kms).

                     KMSKeyId -> (string)
                        If the encryption type  is  aws:kms  ,  this  optional

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not  specify  this  parameter  in  their
          requests.  For  information about downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a restore request for an object

       The  following  restore-object example restores the specified Amazon S3
       Glacier object for the bucket my-glacier-bucket for 10 days.

          aws s3api restore-object \
              --bucket my-glacier-bucket \
              --key doc1.rtf \
              --restore-request Days=10

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.

       RestoreOutputPath -> (string)
          Indicates  the  path in the provided S3 output location where Select
          results will be restored to.
