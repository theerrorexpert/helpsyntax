DESCRIPTION
       WARNING:
          For      an     updated     version     of     this     API,     see
          GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration . If you configured a bucket lifecy-
          cle  using the filter element, you should see the updated version of
          this topic. This topic is provided for backward compatibility.

       Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket.  For
       information about lifecycle configuration, see Object Lifecycle Manage-
       ment .

       To use  this  operation,  you  must  have  permission  to  perform  the
       s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration  action. The bucket owner has this permis-
       sion by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to  others.
       For  more  information  about  permissions,  see Permissions Related to
       Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions  to  Your

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-lifecycle
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to get the lifecycle information.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  retrieves  the  lifecycle  configuration for a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
            "Rules": [

              Specifies lifecycle rules for an  Amazon  S3  bucket.  For  more
              information,  see Put Bucket Lifecycle Configuration in the Ama-
              zon S3 API Reference . For examples, see  Put  Bucket  Lifecycle
              Configuration Examples .

              Expiration -> (structure)
                 Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the object.

                 Date -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates  at  what  date  the  object  is to be moved or
                     deleted. Should be in GMT ISO 8601 Format.

                 Days -> (integer)
                     Indicates the lifetime, in days, of the objects that  are

                 ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether Amazon S3 will remove a  delete  marker
                     with  no  noncurrent versions. If set to true, the delete
                     marker will be expired; if set to false the policy  takes
                     no  action. This cannot be specified with Days or Date in
                     a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.

                 Object  key  prefix  that  identifies  one or more objects to
                 which this rule applies.

                 WARNING:
                     Replacement must be made for object keys containing  spe-
                     cial characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML
                     requests. For more information, see  XML  related  object
                     key constraints .

              Status -> (string)

                 Specifies when an object transitions to a  specified  storage
                 class. For more information about Amazon S3 lifecycle config-
                 uration rules, see  Transitioning  Objects  Using  Amazon  S3
                 Lifecycle in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 Date -> (timestamp)

                     are transitioned to  the  specified  storage  class.  The
                     value must be a positive integer.

                 StorageClass -> (string)
                     The storage class to which you want the object to transi-
                     tion.

              NoncurrentVersionTransition -> (structure)
                 Container for the transition rule that describes when noncur-

                 INTELLIGENT_TIERING , GLACIER_IR , GLACIER , or  DEEP_ARCHIVE
                 storage  class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or ver-
                 sioning is suspended), you can set  this  action  to  request
                 that  Amazon  S3 transition noncurrent object versions to the
                 STANDARD_IA , ONEZONE_IA , INTELLIGENT_TIERING , GLACIER_IR ,

                     before  Amazon  S3 can perform the associated action. For
                     information about the noncurrent days  calculations,  see
                     How Amazon S3 Calculates How Long an Object Has Been Non-
                     current in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 StorageClass -> (string)
                     The class of storage used to store the object.

                     Specifies how many noncurrent  versions  Amazon  S3  will
                     retain.  If  there  are  this many more recent noncurrent
                     versions, Amazon S3 will take the associated action.  For
                     more information about noncurrent versions, see Lifecycle
                     configuration elements in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              NoncurrentVersionExpiration -> (structure)
                 Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon  expi-
                 ration,  Amazon  S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent object
                 versions. You set this lifecycle configuration  action  on  a
                 bucket  that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to request
                 that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions  at  a  spe-
                 cific period in the object's lifetime.

                 NoncurrentDays -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  number  of  days  an object is noncurrent
                     before Amazon S3 can perform the associated  action.  For
                     information  about  the noncurrent days calculations, see
                     How Amazon S3 Calculates When an Object Became Noncurrent
                     in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 NewerNoncurrentVersions -> (integer)
                     Specifies  how  many  noncurrent  versions Amazon S3 will
                     retain. If there are this  many  more  recent  noncurrent
                     versions,  Amazon S3 will take the associated action. For
                     more information about noncurrent versions, see Lifecycle
                     configuration elements in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload -> (structure)
                 Specifies the days since the initiation of an incomplete mul-
                 tipart upload that Amazon S3  will  wait  before  permanently
                 removing  all  parts of the upload. For more information, see
                 Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket  Lifecy-
                 cle Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 DaysAfterInitiation -> (integer)
                     Specifies the number of days after which Amazon S3 aborts
                     an incomplete multipart upload.
