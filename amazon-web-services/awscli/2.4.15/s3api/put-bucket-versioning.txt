PUT-BUCKET-VERSIONING()                                PUT-BUCKET-VERSIONING()



NAME
       put-bucket-versioning -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the versioning state of an existing bucket. To set the versioning
       state, you must be the bucket owner.

       You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:
          Enabled Enables versioning  for  the  objects  in  the  bucket.  All
          objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

          Suspended  Disables  versioning  for  the objects in the bucket. All
          objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

       If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no  ver-
       sioning state; a GetBucketVersioning request does not return a version-
       ing state value.

       If the bucket owner enables MFA Delete in the bucket versioning config-
       uration, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header and
       the Status and the MfaDelete request elements in a request to  set  the
       versioning state of the bucket.

       WARNING:
              If  you  have  an  object  expiration  lifecycle  policy in your
              non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent
              delete  behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a non-
              current expiration policy. The noncurrent  expiration  lifecycle
              policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions
              in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled  bucket  main-
              tains  one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.)
              For more information, see Lifecycle and Versioning .

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-versioning
          --bucket <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          [--mfa <value>]
          --versioning-configuration <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

       --content-md5 (string)
          >The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the  data.  You  must  use
          this  header as a message integrity check to verify that the request
          body was not corrupted in transit. For  more  information,  see  RFC
          1864 .

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs,  this  field  is  calculated
          automatically.

       --mfa (string)
          The  concatenation  of  the authentication device's serial number, a
          space, and the  value  that  is  displayed  on  your  authentication
          device.

       --versioning-configuration (structure)
          Container for setting the versioning state.

          MFADelete -> (string)
              Specifies whether MFA delete is enabled in the bucket versioning
              configuration. This element is only returned if the  bucket  has
              been configured with MFA delete. If the bucket has never been so
              configured, this element is not returned.

          Status -> (string)
              The versioning state of the bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MFADelete=string,Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MFADelete": "Enabled"|"Disabled",
            "Status": "Enabled"|"Suspended"
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command enables versioning on a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

       The following command enables versioning, and uses an mfa code

          aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled --mfa "SERIAL 123456"

OUTPUT
       None
