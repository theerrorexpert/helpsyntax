GET-PUBLIC-ACCESS-BLOCK()                            GET-PUBLIC-ACCESS-BLOCK()



NAME
       get-public-access-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the PublicAccessBlock configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.
       To use this operation, you must have the  s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock
       permission.  For  more  information  about  Amazon  S3 permissions, see
       Specifying Permissions in a Policy .

       WARNING:
          When Amazon S3 evaluates the PublicAccessBlock configuration  for  a
          bucket  or  an object, it checks the PublicAccessBlock configuration
          for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the
          bucket  owner's  account. If the PublicAccessBlock settings are dif-
          ferent between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses  the  most
          restrictive  combination  of the bucket-level and account-level set-
          tings.

       For more information about when Amazon S3  considers  a  bucket  or  an
       object public, see The Meaning of "Public" .

SYNOPSIS
            get-public-access-block
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose PublicAccessBlock configura-
          tion you want to retrieve.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set or modify the block public access configuration for a bucket

       The following get-public-access-block example displays the block public
       access configuration for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api get-public-access-block \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "PublicAccessBlockConfiguration": {
                  "IgnorePublicAcls": true,
                  "BlockPublicPolicy": true,
                  "BlockPublicAcls": true,
                  "RestrictPublicBuckets": true
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       PublicAccessBlockConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  PublicAccessBlock  configuration  currently  in effect for this
          Amazon S3 bucket.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public  access  control
              lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting
              this element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the  specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling  this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs  for  this
              bucket  and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to TRUE
              causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on  this  bucket  and
              objects in this bucket.

              Enabling  this  setting  doesn't  affect  the persistence of any
              existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new  public  ACLs  from  being
              set.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies
              for this bucket. Setting this element to TRUE causes  Amazon  S3
              to  reject  calls  to  PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket
              policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket  poli-
              cies  for  this  bucket.  Setting this element to TRUE restricts
              access to this bucket to only Amazon Web Service principals  and
              authorized  users within this account if the bucket has a public
              policy.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect  previously  stored  bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public bucket policy, including non-public  delegation  to  spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.
