LIST-PARTS()                                                      LIST-PARTS()



NAME
       list-parts -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  parts  that  have  been  uploaded  for a specific multipart
       upload. This operation must include the upload ID, which you obtain  by
       sending     the     initiate     multipart    upload    request    (see
       CreateMultipartUpload ).  This  request  returns  a  maximum  of  1,000
       uploaded  parts.  The  default number of parts returned is 1,000 parts.
       You can restrict  the  number  of  parts  returned  by  specifying  the
       max-parts  request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more
       than 1,000 parts, the response returns an IsTruncated  field  with  the
       value  of true, and a NextPartNumberMarker element. In subsequent List-
       Parts requests you can  include  the  part-number-marker  query  string
       parameter  and  set  its  value to the NextPartNumberMarker field value
       from the previous response.

       Multipart Upload .

       For  information  on  permissions  required to use the multipart upload
       API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions .

       list-parts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Parts

SYNOPSIS
            list-parts
          --bucket <value>
          --key <value>
          --upload-id <value>
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the parts are being uploaded.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       --upload-id (string)
          Upload ID identifying the multipart upload  whose  parts  are  being
          listed.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not  specify  this  parameter  in  their
          requests.  For  information about downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AbortDate -> (timestamp)
          If  the  bucket  has  a  lifecycle rule configured with an action to
          abort incomplete multipart uploads and the prefix in  the  lifecycle
          rule  matches  the  object  name  in  the request, then the response
          includes this header indicating when the initiated multipart  upload
          will  become eligible for abort operation. For more information, see
          Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle  Pol-
          icy .

          The  response  will also include the x-amz-abort-rule-id header that
          will provide the ID of the lifecycle configuration rule that defines
          this action.

       AbortRuleId -> (string)
          This  header  is returned along with the x-amz-abort-date header. It
          identifies applicable lifecycle configuration rule that defines  the
          action to abort incomplete multipart uploads.

       Bucket -> (string)
          The  name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
          Does not return the access point ARN or access point alias if  used.

       Key -> (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       UploadId -> (string)
          Upload  ID  identifying  the  multipart upload whose parts are being
          listed.

       PartNumberMarker -> (integer)
          When a list is truncated, this element specifies the  last  part  in
          the  list,  as  well  as the value to use for the part-number-marker
          request parameter in a subsequent request.

       NextPartNumberMarker -> (integer)
          When a list is truncated, this element specifies the  last  part  in
          the  list,  as  well  as the value to use for the part-number-marker
          request parameter in a subsequent request.

       MaxParts -> (integer)
          Maximum number of parts that were allowed in the response.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the returned list of parts is  truncated.  A  true
          value indicates that the list was truncated. A list can be truncated
          if the number of parts exceeds the limit returned  in  the  MaxParts
          element.

       Parts -> (list)
          Container  for elements related to a particular part. A response can
          contain zero or more Part elements.

          (structure)
              Container for elements related to a part.

              PartNumber -> (integer)
                 Part number identifying the part. This is a positive  integer
                 between 1 and 10,000.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which the part was uploaded.

              ETag -> (string)
                 Entity tag returned when the part was uploaded.

              Size -> (integer)
                 Size in bytes of the uploaded part data.

       Initiator -> (structure)
          Container  element  that  identifies  who  initiated  the  multipart
          upload. If the initiator is an Amazon  Web  Services  account,  this
          element  provides  the same information as the Owner element. If the
          initiator is an IAM User, this element provides  the  user  ARN  and
          display name.

          ID -> (string)
              If  the principal is an Amazon Web Services account, it provides
              the Canonical User ID. If the principal is an IAM User, it  pro-
              vides a user ARN value.

          DisplayName -> (string)
              Name of the Principal.

       Owner -> (structure)
          Container element that identifies the object owner, after the object
          is created. If multipart upload is initiated by an  IAM  user,  this
          element provides the parent account ID and display name.

          DisplayName -> (string)
              Container for the display name of the owner.

          ID -> (string)
              Container for the ID of the owner.

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Class  of storage (STANDARD or REDUCED_REDUNDANCY) used to store the
          uploaded object.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.
