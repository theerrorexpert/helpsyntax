SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-ownership-controls
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose OwnershipControls you want to
          retrieve.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OwnershipControls -> (structure)
          The OwnershipControls (BucketOwnerEnforced, BucketOwnerPreferred, or
          ObjectWriter) currently in effect for this Amazon S3 bucket.

          Rules -> (list)
              The container element for an ownership control rule.

              (structure)
                 The container element for an ownership control rule.

                 ObjectOwnership -> (string)
                     The container element for object ownership for a bucket's
                     ownership controls.

                     BucketOwnerPreferred - Objects  uploaded  to  the  bucket
                     change  ownership  to the bucket owner if the objects are
                     uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL.

                     ObjectWriter - The uploading account will own the  object
                     if the object is uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-con-
                     trol canned ACL.

                     BucketOwnerEnforced - Access  control  lists  (ACLs)  are
                     disabled  and  no  longer  affect permissions. The bucket
                     owner automatically owns and has full control over  every
                     object  in  the  bucket.  The  bucket  only  accepts  PUT
                     requests that don't specify an ACL or bucket  owner  full
                     control   ACLs,  such  as  the  bucket-owner-full-control
                     canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in
                     the XML format.
