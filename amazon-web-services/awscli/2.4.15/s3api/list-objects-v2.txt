LIST-OBJECTS-V2()                                            LIST-OBJECTS-V2()



NAME
       list-objects-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket with each
       request. You can use the request parameters as  selection  criteria  to
       return  a subset of the objects in a bucket. A 200 OK response can con-
       tain valid or invalid XML. Make sure  to  design  your  application  to
       parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. Objects
       are returned sorted in an ascending order of the respective  key  names
       in  the  list.  For more information about listing objects, see Listing
       object keys programmatically

       To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.

       To use this action in an Identity and Access Management  (IAM)  policy,
       you  must  have  permissions  to  perform the s3:ListBucket action. The
       bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this  permis-
       sion to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions
       Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and  Managing  Access  Permis-
       sions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       WARNING:
          This section describes the latest revision of this action. We recom-
          mend that you use this revised API for application development.  For
          backward  compatibility,  Amazon  S3  continues to support the prior
          version of this API, ListObjects .

       To get a list of your buckets, see ListBuckets .

       The following operations are related to ListObjectsV2 :

       o GetObject

       o PutObject

       o CreateBucket

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-objects-v2 is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Contents, CommonPrefixes

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          Bucket name to list.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --delimiter (string)
          A delimiter is a character you use to group keys.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Encoding type used by  Amazon  S3  to  encode  object  keys  in  the
          response.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

       --fetch-owner | --no-fetch-owner (boolean)
          The  owner field is not present in listV2 by default, if you want to
          return owner field with each key in the result then  set  the  fetch
          owner field to true.

       --start-after (string)
          StartAfter is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon
          S3 starts listing after this specified key. StartAfter  can  be  any
          key in the bucket.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for
          the list objects request in V2 style. Bucket owners need not specify
          this parameter in their requests.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Set  to  false  if  all of the results were returned. Set to true if
          more keys are available to return. If the number of results  exceeds
          that specified by MaxKeys, all of the results might not be returned.

       Contents -> (list)
          Metadata about each object returned.

          (structure)
              An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key
                 to retrieve the object.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Creation date of the object.

              ETag -> (string)
                 The  entity  tag  is  a hash of the object. The ETag reflects
                 changes only to the contents of an object, not its  metadata.
                 The  ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data.
                 Whether or not it is depends on how the  object  was  created
                 and how it is encrypted as described below:

                 o Objects  created  by  the  PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy
                   operation, or through the Amazon  Web  Services  Management
                   Console,  and  are  encrypted  by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have
                   ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o Objects created by the PUT Object,  POST  Object,  or  Copy
                   operation,  or  through  the Amazon Web Services Management
                   Console, and are encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have  ETags
                   that are not an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o If  an  object is created by either the Multipart Upload or
                   Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regard-
                   less of the method of encryption.

              Size -> (integer)
                 Size in bytes of the object

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 The owner of the object

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container for the display name of the owner.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

       Name -> (string)
          The bucket name.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       Prefix -> (string)
          Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and  the
          first  occurrence  of  the  delimiter  to be rolled up into a single
          result element in the  CommonPrefixes  collection.  These  rolled-up
          keys  are  not  returned  elsewhere  in the response. Each rolled-up
          result counts as only one return against the MaxKeys value.

       MaxKeys -> (integer)
          Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default
          the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain
          fewer keys but will never contain more.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          All of the keys (up to 1,000) rolled up into a common  prefix  count
          as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

          A  response  can contain CommonPrefixes only if you specify a delim-
          iter.
              CommonPrefixes contains all (if there are any) keys between Pre-
              fix  and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delim-
              iter.

              CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like  subdirectories  in  the
              directory specified by Prefix .

          For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/
          ) as in notes/summer/july , the common prefix is notes/summer/ . All
          of  the  keys  that  roll  up into a common prefix count as a single
          return when calculating the number of returns.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next  occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. Common-
              Prefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in  the  direc-
              tory  specified  by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/
              and the delimiter is a slash (/) as  in  notes/summer/july,  the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding  type  used  by Amazon S3 to encode object key names in the
          XML response.

          If you  specify  the  encoding-type  request  parameter,  Amazon  S3
          includes  this element in the response, and returns encoded key name
          values in the following response elements:
              Delimiter, Prefix, Key, and StartAfter .

       KeyCount -> (integer)
          KeyCount is the number of keys returned with this request.  KeyCount
          will always be less than or equals to MaxKeys field. Say you ask for
          50 keys, your result will include less than equals 50 keys

       ContinuationToken -> (string)
          If ContinuationToken was sent with the request, it  is  included  in
          the response.

       NextContinuationToken -> (string)
          NextContinuationToken  is sent when isTruncated is true, which means
          there are more keys in the bucket that can be listed. The next  list
          requests to Amazon S3 can be continued with this NextContinuationTo-
          ken . NextContinuationToken is obfuscated and is not a real key

       StartAfter -> (string)
          If StartAfter was sent with the  request,  it  is  included  in  the
          response.
