GET-OBJECT()                                                      GET-OBJECT()



NAME
       get-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  objects  from  Amazon  S3.  To  use GET , you must have READ
       access to the object. If you grant READ access to the  anonymous  user,
       you can return the object without using an authorization header.

       An  Amazon  S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find
       in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create  a  logical
       hierarchy  by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For
       example, instead of naming an object sample.jpg , you can name it  pho-
       tos/2006/February/sample.jpg .

       To  get  an  object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key
       name for the object in the GET operation. For  a  virtual  hosted-style
       request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg
       , specify the resource  as  /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg  .  For  a
       path-style  request  example, if you have the object photos/2006/Febru-
       ary/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket , specify the resource
       as  /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg  . For more informa-
       tion about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification .

       To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth  costs
       by  using BitTorrent. For more information, see Amazon S3 Torrent . For
       more information about returning the ACL of an object, see GetObjectAcl
       .

       If  the  object  you  are  retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3
       Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3  Intelligent-Tiering  Archive
       or  S3  Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve
       the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject  .  Other-
       wise,  this action returns an InvalidObjectStateError error. For infor-
       mation about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects
       .

       Encryption  request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption , should
       not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption
       with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3managed
       encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of  keys,
       youll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

       If  you  encrypt  an  object  by using server-side encryption with cus-
       tomer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you  store  the  object  in
       Amazon  S3,  then  when  you GET the object, you must use the following
       headers:

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

       For more information about SSE-C,  see  Server-Side  Encryption  (Using
       Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) .

       Assuming  you  have  the  relevant  permission to read object tags, the
       response also returns the x-amz-tagging-count header that provides  the
       count  of  number  of  tags  associated  with  the  object. You can use
       GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.
          Permissions

       You need the relevant read object  (or  version)  permission  for  this
       operation. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy
       . If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns
       depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.

       o If  you  have  the  s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3
         will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.

       o If you dont have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 will  return
         an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.
          Versioning

       By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To
       return a different version, use the versionId subresource.

       NOTE:

          o If you supply a versionId , you need the s3:GetObjectVersion  per-
            mission  to access a specific version of an object. If you request
            a specific version, you do not need to have the s3:GetObject  per-
            mission.

          o If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3
            behaves   as   if   the   object   was   deleted   and    includes
            x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.

       For more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning .
          Overriding Response Header Values

       There  are times when you want to override certain response header val-
       ues in a GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Dis-
       position response header value in your GET request.

       You can override values for a set of response headers using the follow-
       ing query parameters. These response header values are sent only  on  a
       successful  request,  that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The
       set of headers you can override using these parameters is a  subset  of
       the  headers  that  Amazon  S3  accepts  when you create an object. The
       response headers that you can override for the GET  response  are  Con-
       tent-Type , Content-Language , Expires , Cache-Control , Content-Dispo-
       sition , and Content-Encoding . To override these header values in  the
       GET response, you use the following request parameters.

       NOTE:
          You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a
          presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with
          an unsigned (anonymous) request.

       o response-content-type

       o response-content-language

       o response-expires

       o response-cache-control

       o response-content-disposition

       o response-content-encoding
          Additional Considerations about Request Headers

       If  both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in
       the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates  to  true  ,  and;
       If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ; then, S3 returns 200
       OK and the data requested.

       If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are  present
       in  the request as follows:If-None-Match condition evaluates to false ,
       and; If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true ; then,  S3  returns
       304 Not Modified response code.

       For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name containing the object.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using an Object Lambda access point the hostname takes the form
          AccessPointName   -AccountId   .s3-object-lambda.*Region*   .amazon-
          aws.com.

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --if-match (string)
          Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same  as  the
          one specified, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).

       --if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the  object only if it has been modified since the specified
          time, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).

       --if-none-match (string)
          Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag)  is  different  from
          the one specified, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).

       --if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the object only if it has not been modified since the speci-
          fied time, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).

       --key (string)
          Key of the object to get.

       --range (string)
          Downloads the specified range bytes of an object. For more  informa-
          tion       about      the      HTTP      Range      header,      see
          https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35 .

          NOTE:
              Amazon S3 doesn't support retrieving multiple ranges of data per
              GET request.

       --response-cache-control (string)
          Sets the Cache-Control header of the response.

       --response-content-disposition (string)
          Sets the Content-Disposition header of the response

       --response-content-encoding (string)
          Sets the Content-Encoding header of the response.

       --response-content-language (string)
          Sets the Content-Language header of the response.

       --response-content-type (string)
          Sets the Content-Type header of the response.

       --response-expires (timestamp)
          Sets the Expires header of the response.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies  the  algorithm  to use to when decrypting the object (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 used to
          encrypt  the  data.  This  value  is used to decrypt the object when
          recovering it and must match the one used when storing the data. The
          key  must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according  to
          RFC  1321.  Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket  owners  need  not  specify this parameter in their
          requests. For information about downloading objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --part-number (integer)
          Part number of the object being read. This  is  a  positive  integer
          between  1  and  10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' GET request
          for the part specified. Useful for downloading just  a  part  of  an
          object.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following example uses the get-object command to download an object
       from Amazon S3:

          aws s3api get-object --bucket text-content --key dir/my_images.tar.bz2 my_images.tar.bz2

       Note that the outfile parameter is specified  without  an  option  name
       such  as  "--outfile".  The  name  of  the output file must be the last
       parameter in the command.

       The example below demonstrates the use of --range to  download  a  spe-
       cific  byte range from an object. Note the byte ranges needs to be pre-
       fixed with "bytes=":

          aws s3api get-object --bucket text-content --key dir/my_data --range bytes=8888-9999 my_data_range

       For more information about retrieving objects, see Getting  Objects  in
       the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Body -> (blob)
          Object data.

       DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false)
          a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not  appear  in
          the response.

       AcceptRanges -> (string)
          Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

       Expiration -> (string)
          If  the  object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle),
          the response includes this header. It includes the  expiry-date  and
          rule-id key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The
          value of the rule-id is URL encoded.

       Restore -> (string)
          Provides information about object restoration action and  expiration
          time of the restored object copy.

       LastModified -> (timestamp)
          Creation date of the object.

       ContentLength -> (long)
          Size of the body in bytes.

       ETag -> (string)
          An  ETag  is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a spe-
          cific version of a resource found at a URL.

       MissingMeta -> (integer)
          This is set to the  number  of  metadata  entries  not  returned  in
          x-amz-meta  headers. This can happen if you create metadata using an
          API like SOAP that supports more flexible  metadata  than  the  REST
          API.  For  example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values
          are not legal HTTP headers.

       VersionId -> (string)
          Version of the object.

       CacheControl -> (string)
          Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

       ContentDisposition -> (string)
          Specifies presentational information for the object.

       ContentEncoding -> (string)
          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
          thus  what  decoding  mechanisms  must  be  applied  to  obtain  the
          media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       ContentLanguage -> (string)
          The language the content is in.

       ContentRange -> (string)
          The portion of the object returned in the response.

       ContentType -> (string)
          A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

       Expires -> (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

       WebsiteRedirectLocation -> (string)
          If the bucket is configured as a  website,  redirects  requests  for
          this  object  to another object in the same bucket or to an external
          URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the  object  meta-
          data.

       ServerSideEncryption -> (string)
          The  server-side  encryption algorithm used when storing this object
          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

       Metadata -> (map)
          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       SSECustomerAlgorithm -> (string)
          If server-side encryption with a  customer-provided  encryption  key
          was  requested, the response will include this header confirming the
          encryption algorithm used.

       SSECustomerKeyMD5 -> (string)
          If server-side encryption with a  customer-provided  encryption  key
          was  requested,  the  response  will  include this header to provide
          round-trip message integrity verification of  the  customer-provided
          encryption key.

       SSEKMSKeyId -> (string)
          If  present, specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key Manage-
          ment Service (Amazon Web Services KMS)  symmetric  customer  managed
          key that was used for the object.

       BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the object uses an S3 Bucket Key for server-side
          encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS (SSE-KMS).

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3  returns
          this  header  for  all  objects except for S3 Standard storage class
          objects.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.

       ReplicationStatus -> (string)
          Amazon  S3 can return this if your request involves a bucket that is
          either a source or destination in a replication rule.

       PartsCount -> (integer)
          The count of parts this object has.

       TagCount -> (integer)
          The number of tags, if any, on the object.

       ObjectLockMode -> (string)
          The Object Lock mode currently in place for this object.

       ObjectLockRetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when this object's Object Lock will expire.

       ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus -> (string)
          Indicates whether this object has an active legal hold.  This  field
          is  only  returned  if you have permission to view an object's legal
          hold status.



                                                                  GET-OBJECT()
