GET-BUCKET-LOCATION()                                    GET-BUCKET-LOCATION()



NAME
       get-bucket-location -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  Region the bucket resides in. You set the bucket's Region
       using  the  LocationConstraint  request  parameter  in  a  CreateBucket
       request. For more information, see CreateBucket .

       To  use  this  implementation  of the operation, you must be the bucket
       owner.

       To use this API against an access  point,  provide  the  alias  of  the
       access point in place of the bucket name.

       The following operations are related to GetBucketLocation :

       o GetObject

       o CreateBucket

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-location
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to get the location.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  retrieves the location constraint for a bucket
       named my-bucket, if a constraint exists:

          aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "LocationConstraint": "us-west-2"
          }

OUTPUT
       LocationConstraint -> (string)
          Specifies the Region where the bucket resides. For a list of all the
          Amazon  S3 supported location constraints by Region, see Regions and
          Endpoints . Buckets in Region us-east-1 have a LocationConstraint of
          null .
