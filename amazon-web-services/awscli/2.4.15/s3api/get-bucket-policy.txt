GET-BUCKET-POLICY()                                        GET-BUCKET-POLICY()



NAME
       get-bucket-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity
       other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account  that  owns
       the  bucket, the calling identity must have the GetBucketPolicy permis-
       sions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's  account
       in order to use this operation.

       If  you don't have GetBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403
       Access Denied error. If you have the correct  permissions,  but  you're
       not  using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Ama-
       zon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

       WARNING:
          As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon  Web  Services
          account  that  owns  a bucket can always use this operation, even if
          the policy explicitly denies the root user the  ability  to  perform
          this action.

       For  more  information about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies
       and User Policies .

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-policy
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the bucket policy.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command retrieves the bucket policy for  a  bucket  named
       my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "Policy": "{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":\"*\",\"Action\":\"s3:GetObject\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*\"},{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Principal\":\"*\",\"Action\":\"s3:GetObject\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/secret/*\"}]}"
          }

   Get and put a bucket policy
       The  following  example  shows how you can download an Amazon S3 bucket
       policy, make modifications to the file, and then use  put-bucket-policy
       to  apply the modified bucket policy.  To download the bucket policy to
       a file, you can run:

          aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket mybucket --query Policy --output text > policy.json

       You can then modify the policy.json file as needed.   Finally  you  can
       apply this modified policy back to the S3 bucket by running:

          aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket mybucket --policy file://policy.json

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (string)
          The bucket policy as a JSON document.
