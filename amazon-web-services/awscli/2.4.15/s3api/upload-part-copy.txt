UPLOAD-PART-COPY()                                          UPLOAD-PART-COPY()



NAME
       upload-part-copy -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads  a part by copying data from an existing object as data source.
       You  specify  the  data   source   by   adding   the   request   header
       x-amz-copy-source  in  your  request  and  a  byte  range by adding the
       request header x-amz-copy-source-range in your request.

       The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload  is  5  MB.  For
       more  information  about  multipart upload limits, go to Quick Facts in
       the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
          Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use  the
          UploadPart action and provide data in your request.

       You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In
       response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a  unique  identi-
       fier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request.

       For more information about using the UploadPartCopy operation, see  the
       following:

       o For  conceptual  information  about  multipart uploads, see Uploading
         Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       o For information about  permissions  required  to  use  the  multipart
         upload  API,  see  Multipart  Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3
         User Guide .

       o For information about copying objects using a  single  atomic  action
         vs.  the multipart upload, see Operations on Objects in the Amazon S3
         User Guide .

       o For information about using server-side encryption with customer-pro-
         vided   encryption   keys  with  the  UploadPartCopy  operation,  see
         CopyObject and UploadPart .

       Note the following additional considerations about the request  headers
       x-amz-copy-source-if-match    ,    x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match    ,
       x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since , and  x-amz-copy-source-if-modi-
       fied-since :

       o Consideration  1  -  If  both  of  the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and
         x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since  headers  are  present  in  the
         request  as  follows:  x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates
         to true , and;  x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition eval-
         uates to false ; Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data.

       o Consideration  2 - If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and
         x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since  headers  are  present   in   the
         request as follows:  x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evalu-
         ates to false , and;   x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since  condition
         evaluates  to  true  ;  Amazon  S3  returns  412  Precondition Failed
         response code.
          Versioning

       If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions
       of  the  same object. By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the cur-
       rent version of the object to copy. If the current version is a  delete
       marker  and  you  don't  specify a versionId in the x-amz-copy-source ,
       Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does  not  exist.  If
       you  specify  versionId in the x-amz-copy-source and the versionId is a
       delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not
       allowed   to   specify   a   delete   marker   as  a  version  for  the
       x-amz-copy-source .

       You can optionally specify a specific version of the source  object  to
       copy  by  adding  the  versionId  subresource as shown in the following
       example:
          x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id

          Special Errors

       o

         o Code: NoSuchUpload

         o Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID
           might  be  invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted
           or completed.

         o HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found

       o

            o Code: InvalidRequest

            o Cause:  The  specified  copy  source  is  not  supported  as   a
              byte-range copy source.

            o HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --copy-source (string)
          Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify  the
          value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access
          the source object through an access point :

          o For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
            of  the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a
            slash (/). For example, to  copy  the  object  reports/january.pdf
            from    the    bucket    awsexamplebucket    ,   use   awsexample-
            bucket/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.

          o For objects accessed through access  points,  specify  the  Amazon
            Resource  Name  (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
            point,  in  the  format   arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:access-
            point/<access-point-name>/object/<key>  . For example, to copy the
            object reports/january.pdf through  access  point  my-access-point
            owned  by  account  123456789012 in Region us-west-2 , use the URL
            encoding       of        arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:access-
            point/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf  . The value must
            be URL encoded.

          NOTE:
                 Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access  points  only
                 when  the source and destination buckets are in the same Ama-
                 zon Web Services Region.

              Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon  S3  on  Out-
              posts,  specify  the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
              arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
              post-id>/object/<key>   .   For  example,  to  copy  the  object
              reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by  account
              123456789012  in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the URL encoding of
              arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
              post/object/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.

          To copy a specific version of  an  object,  append  ?versionId=<ver-
          sion-id>  to  the  value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/jan-
          uary.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893  ).  If   you
          don't  specify  a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of
          the source object.

       --copy-source-if-match (string)
          Copies the object if its entity tag  (ETag)  matches  the  specified
          tag.

       --copy-source-if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Copies  the object if it has been modified since the specified time.

       --copy-source-if-none-match (string)
          Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag)  is  different  than  the
          specified ETag.

       --copy-source-if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Copies  the  object  if  it hasn't been modified since the specified
          time.

       --copy-source-range (string)
          The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The  range  value
          must use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the
          zero-based byte offsets to copy. For  example,  bytes=0-9  indicates
          that you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy
          a range only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       --part-number (integer)
          Part number of part being copied. This is a positive integer between
          1 and 10,000.

       --upload-id (string)
          Upload  ID  identifying  the  multipart  upload  whose part is being
          copied.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting  the  object  (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and  then
          it  is  discarded;  Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The
          key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in  the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header. This must be
          the same encryption key specified in the initiate  multipart  upload
          request.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --copy-source-sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies  the  algorithm  to  use when decrypting the source object
          (for example, AES256).

       --copy-source-sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to  use
          to  decrypt  the  source object. The encryption key provided in this
          header must be one that was used when the source object was created.

       --copy-source-sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not  specify  this  parameter  in  their
          requests.  For  information about downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the des-
          tination bucket is owned by a different account,  the  request  will
          fail with an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error.

       --expected-source-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account  ID  of the expected source bucket owner. If the source
          bucket is owned by a different account, the request will  fail  with
          an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
