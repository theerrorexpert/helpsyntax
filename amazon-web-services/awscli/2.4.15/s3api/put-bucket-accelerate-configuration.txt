PUT-BUCKET-ACCELERATE-CONFIGURATION()    PUT-BUCKET-ACCELERATE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-accelerate-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the  accelerate  configuration  of  an existing bucket. Amazon S3
       Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature  that  enables  you  to
       perform faster data transfers to Amazon S3.

       To  use  this  operation,  you  must  have  permission  to  perform the
       s3:PutAccelerateConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permis-
       sion  by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.
       For more information about  permissions,  see  Permissions  Related  to
       Bucket  Subresource  Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your
       Amazon S3 Resources .

       The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to  one  of  the
       following two values:

       o Enabled  Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.

       o Suspended  Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.

       The GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration action returns the transfer accel-
       eration state of a bucket.

       After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket  to  Enabled,
       it  might  take  up to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to
       the bucket increase.

       The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be  DNS-com-
       pliant and must not contain periods (".").

       For more information about transfer acceleration, see Transfer Acceler-
       ation .

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-accelerate-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --accelerate-configuration <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name  of  the  bucket for which the accelerate configuration is
          set.

       --accelerate-configuration (structure)
          Container for setting the transfer acceleration state.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the transfer acceleration status of the bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "Enabled"|"Suspended"
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set the accelerate configuration of a bucket

       The following put-bucket-accelerate-configuration example  enables  the
       accelerate configuration for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-accelerate-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --accelerate-configuration Status=Enabled

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
