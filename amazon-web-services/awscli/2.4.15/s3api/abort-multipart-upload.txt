ABORT-MULTIPART-UPLOAD()                              ABORT-MULTIPART-UPLOAD()



NAME
       abort-multipart-upload -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action  aborts  a  multipart  upload. After a multipart upload is
       aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID.  The
       storage  consumed  by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. How-
       ever, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads
       might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort
       a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all
       storage consumed by all parts.

       To  verify  that  all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged
       for the part storage, you should call the ListParts action  and  ensure
       that the parts list is empty.

       For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload,
       see Multipart Upload and Permissions .

SYNOPSIS
            abort-multipart-upload
          --bucket <value>
          --key <value>
          --upload-id <value>
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name to which the upload was taking place.

          When using this  action  with  an  access  point,  you  must  direct
          requests  to  the  access  point hostname. The access point hostname
          takes the form AccessPointName  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through
          the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access  point  ARN  in
          place  of  the  bucket name. For more information about access point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --key (string)
          Key of the object for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       --upload-id (string)
          Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not  specify  this  parameter  in  their
          requests.  For  information about downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To abort the specified multipart upload

       The  following abort-multipart-upload command aborts a multipart upload
       for the key multipart/01 in the bucket my-bucket.

          aws s3api abort-multipart-upload \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key multipart/01 \
              --upload-id dfRtDYU0WWCCcH43C3WFbkRONycyCpTJJvxu2i5GYkZljF.Yxwh6XG7WfS2vC4to6HiV6Yjlx.cph0gtNBtJ8P3URCSbB7rjxI5iEwVDmgaXZOGgkk5nVTW16HOQ5l0R

       The upload ID required by  this  command  is  output  by  create-multi-
       part-upload and can also be retrieved with list-multipart-uploads.

OUTPUT
       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.
