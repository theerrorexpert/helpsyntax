PUT-BUCKET-WEBSITE()                                      PUT-BUCKET-WEBSITE()



NAME
       put-bucket-website -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the configuration of the website that is specified in the website
       subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this  sub-
       resource  on  the bucket with website configuration information such as
       the file name of the index document and any redirect  rules.  For  more
       information, see Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 .

       This   PUT  action  requires  the  S3:PutBucketWebsite  permission.  By
       default, only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to  a
       bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website
       configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them  the  S3:Put-
       BucketWebsite permission.

       To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint,
       you add a website configuration with the  following  elements.  Because
       all  requests  are  sent  to another website, you don't need to provide
       index document name for the bucket.

       o WebsiteConfiguration

       o RedirectAllRequestsTo

       o HostName

       o Protocol

       If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the  following
       elements  to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting
       requests and information about the redirect destination. In this  case,
       the  website  configuration  must  provide  an  index  document for the
       bucket, because some requests might not be redirected.

       o WebsiteConfiguration

       o IndexDocument

       o Suffix

       o ErrorDocument

       o Key

       o RoutingRules

       o RoutingRule

       o Condition

       o HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals

       o KeyPrefixEquals

       o Redirect

       o Protocol

       o HostName

       o ReplaceKeyPrefixWith

       o ReplaceKeyWith

       o HttpRedirectCode

       Amazon S3 has a limitation of 50 routing rules per  website  configura-
       tion. If you require more than 50 routing rules, you can use object re-
       direct. For more information, see Configuring an Object Redirect in the
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 A suffix that is appended to a request that is for  a  direc-
                 tory  on  the  website endpoint (for example,if the suffix is
                 index.html and you make a request to samplebucket/images/ the
                 data  that  is  returned  will be for the object with the key
                 name images/index.html) The suffix must not be empty and must
                 not include a slash character.

                 WARNING:

              The redirect behavior for every request to this bucket's website
              endpoint.

              WARNING:
                 If  you  specify  this  property, you can't specify any other
                 property.

              HostName -> (string)
                 Name of the host where requests are redirected.

              Protocol -> (string)
                 Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default is the
                 protocol that is used in the original request.

          RoutingRules -> (list)
              Rules  that  define  when a redirect is applied and the redirect
              behavior.

              (structure)
                 Specifies the  redirect  behavior  and  when  a  redirect  is
                 applied.  For  more  information  about  routing  rules,  see
                 Configuring advanced conditional redirects in the  Amazon  S3
                 User Guide .

                 Condition -> (structure)
                     A  container  for describing a condition that must be met
                     for the specified redirect to apply. For example,  1.  If
                     request is for pages in the /docs folder, redirect to the
                     /documents folder. 2. If request results  in  HTTP  error
                     4xx,  redirect  request  to  another host where you might
                     process the error.

                     HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals -> (string)
                        The HTTP error code when the redirect is  applied.  In
                        the  event  of an error, if the error code equals this
                        value,  then  the  specified  redirect   is   applied.
                        Required  when  parent  element Condition is specified
                        and sibling KeyPrefixEquals is not specified. If  both
                        are specified, then both must be true for the redirect
                        to be applied.

                     KeyPrefixEquals -> (string)
                        The object  key  name  prefix  when  the  redirect  is
                        applied.  For  example, to redirect requests for Exam-
                        plePage.html , the key prefix will be ExamplePage.html
                        .  To  redirect  request for all pages with the prefix
                        docs/ , the key prefix will be /docs ,  which  identi-
                        fies  all  objects  in the docs/ folder. Required when
                        the parent element Condition is specified and  sibling
                        HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals  is not specified. If both
                        conditions are specified, both must be  true  for  the
                        redirect to be applied.

                        WARNING:
                            Replacement  must be made for object keys contain-
                            ing special characters (such as carriage  returns)
                            when using XML requests. For more information, see
                            XML related object key constraints .

                     Container for  redirect  information.  You  can  redirect
                     requests  to  another  host,  to  another  page,  or with
                     another protocol. In the event of an error, you can spec-
                     ify a different error code to return.

                     HostName -> (string)
                        The host name to use in the redirect request.

                     HttpRedirectCode -> (string)
                        The  HTTP  redirect  code  to use on the response. Not

                     Protocol -> (string)
                        Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default
                        is  the protocol that is used in the original request.

                     ReplaceKeyPrefixWith -> (string)
                        The object key prefix to use in the redirect  request.
                        For  example,  to redirect requests for all pages with
                        prefix docs/ (objects in the docs/  folder)  to  docu-
                        ments/ , you can set a condition block with KeyPrefix-
                        Equals  set  to  docs/  and  in   the   Redirect   set
                        ReplaceKeyPrefixWith  to  /documents . Not required if
                        one of the siblings is present. Can be present only if

                     ReplaceKeyWith -> (string)
                        The  specific  object  key  to  use  in  the  redirect
                        request. For example, redirect request to error.html .
                        Not required if one of the siblings is present. Can be

              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The applies a static website configuration to a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api put-bucket-website --bucket my-bucket --website-configuration file://website.json

       The file website.json is a JSON document in  the  current  folder  that
       specifies index and error pages for the website:

          {
              "IndexDocument": {
                  "Suffix": "index.html"
              },
              "ErrorDocument": {
                  "Key": "error.html"
              }
          }
