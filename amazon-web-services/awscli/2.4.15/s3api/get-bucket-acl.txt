GET-BUCKET-ACL()                                              GET-BUCKET-ACL()



NAME
       get-bucket-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       This  implementation  of  the  GET  action  uses the acl subresource to
       return the access control list (ACL) of a bucket. To use GET to  return
       the  ACL of the bucket, you must have READ_ACP access to the bucket. If
       READ_ACP permission is granted to the anonymous user,  you  can  return
       the ACL of the bucket without using an authorization header.

       NOTE:
              If  your  bucket  uses  the bucket owner enforced setting for S3
              Object Ownership, requests to read ACLs are still supported  and
              return  the  bucket-owner-full-control  ACL with the owner being
              the account that created the bucket. For more  information,  see
              Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3
              User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-acl
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          Specifies the S3 bucket whose ACL is being requested.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command retrieves the access control list  for  a  bucket
       named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket my-bucket
