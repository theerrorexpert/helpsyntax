PUT-BUCKET-TAGGING()                                      PUT-BUCKET-TAGGING()



NAME
       put-bucket-tagging -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the tags for a bucket.

       Use  tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own
       cost structure. To do this, sign up to get  your  Amazon  Web  Services
       account  bill  with  tag  key values included. Then, to see the cost of
       combined resources, organize  your  billing  information  according  to
       resources  with  the same tag key values. For example, you can tag sev-
       eral resources with a specific application name, and then organize your
       billing  information  to  see the total cost of that application across
       several services. For more information, see Cost Allocation and Tagging
       and Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3 Bucket Tags .

       NOTE:
          When  this  operation  sets the tags for a bucket, it will overwrite
          any current tags the bucket already has. You cannot use this  opera-
          tion to add tags to an existing list of tags.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Put-
       BucketTagging action. The bucket owner has this permission  by  default
       and  can  grant  this  permission to others. For more information about
       permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket  Subresource  Operations
       and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .
          PutBucketTagging has the following special errors:

       o Error code: InvalidTagError

         o Description:  The  tag provided was not a valid tag. This error can
           occur if the tag did not pass  input  validation.  For  information
           about  tag  restrictions,  see  User-Defined  Tag  Restrictions and
           Amazon Web Services-Generated Cost Allocation Tag Restrictions .

       o Error code: MalformedXMLError

         o Description: The XML provided does not match the schema.

       o Error code: OperationAbortedError

         o Description: A  conflicting  conditional  action  is  currently  in
           progress against this resource. Please try again.

       o Error code: InternalError

         o Description:  The  service  was unable to apply the provided tag to
           the bucket.

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-tagging
          --bucket <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          --tagging <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. You must use this
          header  as a message integrity check to verify that the request body
          was not corrupted in transit. For more information, see RFC 1864 .

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face  (CLI)  or  Amazon  Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated
          automatically.

       --tagging (structure)
          Container for the TagSet and Tag elements.

          TagSet -> (list)
              A collection for a set of tags

              (structure)
                 A container of a key value name pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagSet=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TagSet": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command applies a tagging configuration to a bucket named
       my-bucket:

          aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket my-bucket --tagging file://tagging.json

       The  file  tagging.json  is  a JSON document in the current folder that
       specifies tags:

          {
             "TagSet": [
               {
                 "Key": "organization",
                 "Value": "marketing"
               }
             ]
          }

       Or apply a tagging configuration to my-bucket directly from the command
       line:

          aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket my-bucket --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=organization,Value=marketing}]'

OUTPUT
       None
