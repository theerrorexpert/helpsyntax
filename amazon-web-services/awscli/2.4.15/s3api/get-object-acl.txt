GET-OBJECT-ACL()                                              GET-OBJECT-ACL()



NAME
       get-object-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the access control list (ACL) of an object. To use this opera-
       tion, you must have READ_ACP access to the object.

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
          Versioning

       By default, GET returns ACL information about the current version of an
       object.  To  return  ACL information about a different version, use the
       versionId subresource.

       NOTE:
          If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3  Object
          Ownership,  requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the
          bucket-owner-full-control ACL with the owner being the account  that
          created  the  bucket.  For  more information, see Controlling object
          ownership and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       The following operations are related to GetObjectAcl :

       o GetObject

       o DeleteObject

       o PutObject

SYNOPSIS
            get-object-acl
          --bucket <value>
          --key <value>
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name that contains the object for which to  get  the  ACL
          information.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --key (string)
          The key of the object for which to get the ACL information.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not  specify  this  parameter  in  their
          requests.  For  information about downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command retrieves the access control list for an object
       in a bucket named my-bucket:

       Output:
