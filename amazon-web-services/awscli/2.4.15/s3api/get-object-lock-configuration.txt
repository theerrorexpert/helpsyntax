GET-OBJECT-LOCK-CONFIGURATION()                GET-OBJECT-LOCK-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-object-lock-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the Object Lock configuration for a bucket. The rule specified in
       the Object Lock configuration will be applied by default to  every  new
       object  placed  in  the  specified  bucket.  For  more information, see
       Locking Objects .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-object-lock-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket whose Object Lock configuration you want to retrieve.

          When using this  action  with  an  access  point,  you  must  direct
          requests  to  the  access  point hostname. The access point hostname
          takes the form AccessPointName  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through
          the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access  point  ARN  in
          place  of  the  bucket name. For more information about access point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve an object lock configuration for a bucket

       The  following  get-object-lock-configuration  example  retrieves   the
       object lock configuration for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api get-object-lock-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket-with-object-lock

       Output:

          {
              "ObjectLockConfiguration": {
                  "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled",
                  "Rule": {
                      "DefaultRetention": {
                          "Mode": "COMPLIANCE",
                          "Days": 50
                      }
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ObjectLockConfiguration -> (structure)
          The specified bucket's Object Lock configuration.

          ObjectLockEnabled -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  this bucket has an Object Lock configuration
              enabled. Enable ObjectLockEnabled when you apply  ObjectLockCon-
              figuration to a bucket.

          Rule -> (structure)
              Specifies  the Object Lock rule for the specified object. Enable
              the this  rule  when  you  apply  ObjectLockConfiguration  to  a
              bucket.  Bucket  settings  require both a mode and a period. The
              period can be either Days or Years but you must select one.  You
              cannot specify Days and Years at the same time.

              DefaultRetention -> (structure)
                 The  default  Object  Lock retention mode and period that you
                 want to apply to new objects placed in the specified  bucket.
                 Bucket  settings require both a mode and a period. The period

                 Mode -> (string)
                     The  default Object Lock retention mode you want to apply
                     to new objects placed in the specified  bucket.  Must  be
                     used with either Days or Years .

                 Days -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  days  that  you  want to specify for the
                     default retention period. Must be used with Mode .

                 Years -> (integer)
                     The number of years that you  want  to  specify  for  the
                     default retention period. Must be used with Mode .
