NAME
       get-bucket-notification-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the notification configuration of a bucket.

       If  notifications  are not enabled on the bucket, the action returns an
       empty NotificationConfiguration element.

       By default, you must be the bucket owner to read the notification  con-
       figuration of a bucket. However, the bucket owner can use a bucket pol-
       icy to grant permission to other users to read this configuration  with
       the s3:GetBucketNotification permission.

       For more information about setting and reading the notification config-
       uration on a bucket, see Setting Up Notification of Bucket Events . For
       more information about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies .

       The following action is related to GetBucketNotification :

       o PutBucketNotification

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-notification-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name of the bucket for which to get the notification configura-
          tion.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command retrieves the notification  configuration  for  a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-notification-configuration --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "TopicConfigurations": [
