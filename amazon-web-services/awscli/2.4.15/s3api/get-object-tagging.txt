GET-OBJECT-TAGGING()                                      GET-OBJECT-TAGGING()



NAME
       get-object-tagging -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the tag-set of an object. You send the GET request against the
       tagging subresource associated with the object.

       To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:GetO-
       bjectTagging  action.  By  default,  the GET action returns information
       about current version of an object. For a  versioned  bucket,  you  can
       have multiple versions of an object in your bucket. To retrieve tags of
       any other version, use the versionId query  parameter.  You  also  need
       permission for the s3:GetObjectVersionTagging action.

       By  default,  the  bucket  owner has this permission and can grant this
       permission to others.

       For information about the Amazon S3 object tagging feature, see  Object
       Tagging .

       The following action is related to GetObjectTagging :

SYNOPSIS
            get-object-tagging
          --bucket <value>
          --key <value>
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  bucket  name containing the object for which to get the tagging
          information.

          When using this  action  with  an  access  point,  you  must  direct
          requests  to  the  access  point hostname. The access point hostname
          takes the form AccessPointName  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through
          the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access  point  ARN  in
          place  of  the  bucket name. For more information about access point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --key (string)
          Object key for which to get the tagging information.

       --version-id (string)
          The  versionId  of  the object for which to get the tagging informa-
          tion.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket  owners  need  not  specify this parameter in their
          requests. For information about downloading objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the tags attached to an object

       The following get-object-tagging example retrieves the values  for  the
       specified key from the specified object.

          aws s3api get-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc1.rtf

       Output:

          {
              "TagSet": [
                  {
                      "Value": "confidential",
                      "Key": "designation"
                  }
              ]
          }

       The following get-object-tagging example tries to retrieve the tag sets
       of the object doc2.rtf, which has no tags.

          aws s3api get-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc2.rtf

       Output:

          {
              "TagSet": []
          }

       The following get-object-tagging example retrieves the tag sets of  the
       object doc3.rtf, which has multiple tags.

          aws s3api get-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc3.rtf

       Output:

          {
              "TagSet": [
                  {
                      "Value": "confidential",
                      "Key": "designation"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "finance",
                      "Key": "department"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "payroll",
                      "Key": "team"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       VersionId -> (string)
          The  versionId  of the object for which you got the tagging informa-
          tion.

       TagSet -> (list)
          Contains the tag set.

          (structure)
              A container of a key value name pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 Name of the object key.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag.
