PUT-BUCKET-POLICY()                                        PUT-BUCKET-POLICY()



NAME
       put-bucket-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  an  Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you are
       using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon  Web  Services
       account  that  owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the Put-
       BucketPolicy permissions on the specified  bucket  and  belong  to  the
       bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.

       If  you don't have PutBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403
       Access Denied error. If you have the correct  permissions,  but  you're
       not  using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Ama-
       zon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

       WARNING:
          As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon  Web  Services
          account  that  owns  a bucket can always use this operation, even if
          the policy explicitly denies the root user the  ability  to  perform
          this action.

       For more information, see Bucket policy examples .

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-policy
          --bucket <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          [--confirm-remove-self-bucket-access | --no-confirm-remove-self-bucket-access]
          --policy <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash of the request body.

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs,  this  field  is  calculated
          automatically.

       --confirm-remove-self-bucket-access             |             --no-con-
       firm-remove-self-bucket-access (boolean)
          Set this parameter to true to confirm that you want to  remove  your
          permissions to change this bucket policy in the future.

       --policy (string)
          The bucket policy as a JSON document.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       This example allows all users to retrieve any object in MyBucket except
       those in the MySecretFolder. It also grants put and  delete  permission
       to the root user of the AWS account 1234-5678-9012:

          aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket MyBucket --policy file://policy.json

          policy.json:
          {
             "Statement": [
                {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": "*",
                   "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/*"
                },
                {
                   "Effect": "Deny",
                   "Principal": "*",
                   "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/MySecretFolder/*"
                },
                {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": {
                      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
                   },
                   "Action": [
                      "s3:DeleteObject",
                      "s3:PutObject"
                   ],
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/*"
                }
