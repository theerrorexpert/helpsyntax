COPY-OBJECT()                                                    COPY-OBJECT()



NAME
       copy-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

       NOTE:
          You  can  store  individual  objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You
          create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a  single  atomic
          action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB,
          you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API.  For  more
          information, see Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API .

       All  copy  requests  must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have
       read access to the source object and write access  to  the  destination
       bucket. For more information, see REST Authentication . Both the Region
       that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you  want  to
       copy the object to must be enabled for your account.

       A  copy  request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy
       request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If  the  error  occurs
       before  the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error.
       If the error occurs during the copy operation, the  error  response  is
       embedded  in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response can
       contain either a success or an error. Design your application to  parse
       the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.

       If  the  copy  is  successful,  you receive a response with information
       about the copied object.

       NOTE:
          If the request is  an  HTTP  1.1  request,  the  response  is  chunk
          encoded.  If  it  were not, it would not contain the content-length,
          and you would need to read the entire body.

       The copy request charge is based on the storage class and  Region  that
       you  specify  for  the destination object. For pricing information, see
       Amazon S3 pricing .

       WARNING:
              Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does  not  support  cross-Region
              copies.  If  you  request  a  cross-Region copy using a transfer
              acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 Bad Request error. For more
              information, see Transfer Acceleration .

          Metadata

       When  copying  an  object,  you  can preserve all metadata (default) or
       specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is  set  to
       private  for  the  user making the request. To override the default ACL
       setting, specify a new ACL when generating a  copy  request.  For  more
       information, see Using ACLs .

       To  specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source
       object or replaced with metadata  provided  in  the  request,  you  can
       optionally add the x-amz-metadata-directive header. When you grant per-
       missions, you can use the s3:x-amz-metadata-directive condition key  to
       enforce  certain  metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more
       information, see Specifying Conditions in a Policy  in  the  Amazon  S3
       User  Guide . For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys,
       see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 .
          ** x-amz-copy-source-if Headers**

       To only copy an object under certain conditions, such  as  whether  the
       Etag matches or whether the object was modified before or after a spec-
       ified date, use the following request parameters:

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-match

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since

       If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodi-
       fied-since  headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows,
       Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false

       If       both       the       x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match       and
       x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since  headers are present in the request
       and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the 412 Precondition  Failed
       response code:

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true

       NOTE:
              All  headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source
              , must be signed.

          Server-side encryption

       When you perform a CopyObject operation, you  can  optionally  use  the
       appropriate  encryption-related  headers  to  encrypt  the object using
       server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys
       (SSE-S3  or  SSE-KMS)  or  a  customer-provided  encryption  key.  With
       server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to
       disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For
       more information about server-side encryption,  see  Using  Server-Side
       Encryption .

       If  a  target  object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for
       the object. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the Ama-
       zon S3 User Guide .
          Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

       When  copying  an  object,  you  can  optionally  use  headers to grant
       ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are  private.  Only  the
       owner  has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant
       permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined
       groups  defined  by  Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the
       ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List  (ACL)
       Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API .

       If  the  bucket  that  you're  copying objects to uses the bucket owner
       enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership,  ACLs  are  disabled  and  no
       longer  affect  permissions.  Buckets that use this setting only accept
       PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or  PUT  requests  that  specify
       bucket  owner  full control ACLs, such as the bucket-owner-full-control
       canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML  for-
       mat.

       For  more  information,  see  Controlling ownership of objects and dis-
       abling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
              If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
              Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will
              be owned by the bucket owner.

          Storage Class Options

       You can use the CopyObject action to change the  storage  class  of  an
       object  that  is  already  stored  in  Amazon S3 using the StorageClass
       parameter. For more information, see Storage Classes in the  Amazon  S3
       User Guide .
          Versioning

       By  default,  x-amz-copy-source  identifies  the  current version of an
       object to copy. If the current version is a delete  marker,  Amazon  S3
       behaves  as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use
       the versionId subresource.

       If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon  S3  generates  a
       unique  version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is dif-
       ferent from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns  the
       version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header
       in the response.

       If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the
       version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.

       If  the  source  object's  storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a
       copy of this object before you can use it as a source  object  for  the
       copy operation. For more information, see RestoreObject .

       The following operations are related to CopyObject :

       o PutObject

       o GetObject

       For more information, see Copying Objects .

OPTIONS
       --acl (string)
          The canned ACL to apply to the object.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o aws-exec-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the destination bucket.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --cache-control (string)
          Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

       --content-disposition (string)
          Specifies presentational information for the object.

       --content-encoding (string)
          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
          thus  what  decoding  mechanisms  must  be  applied  to  obtain  the
          media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       --content-language (string)
          The language the content is in.

       --content-type (string)
          A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

       --copy-source (string)
          Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify  the
          value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access
          the source object through an access point :

          o For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
            of  the  source bucket and the key of the source object, separated
            by a slash (/). For  example,  to  copy  the  object  reports/jan-
            uary.pdf  from  the  bucket  awsexamplebucket  ,  use  awsexample-
            bucket/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.

          o For objects accessed through access  points,  specify  the  Amazon
            Resource  Name  (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
            point,  in  the  format   arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:access-
            point/<access-point-name>/object/<key>  . For example, to copy the
            object reports/january.pdf through  access  point  my-access-point
            owned  by  account  123456789012 in Region us-west-2 , use the URL
            encoding       of        arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:access-
            point/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf  . The value must
            be URL encoded.

          NOTE:
                 Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access  points  only
                 when  the source and destination buckets are in the same Ama-
                 zon Web Services Region.

              Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon  S3  on  Out-
              posts,  specify  the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
              arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
              post-id>/object/<key>   .   For  example,  to  copy  the  object
              reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by  account
              123456789012  in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the URL encoding of
              arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
              post/object/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.

          To copy a specific version of  an  object,  append  ?versionId=<ver-
          sion-id>  to  the  value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/jan-
          uary.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893  ).  If   you
          don't  specify  a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of
          the source object.

       --copy-source-if-match (string)
          Copies the object if its entity tag  (ETag)  matches  the  specified
          tag.

       --copy-source-if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Copies  the object if it has been modified since the specified time.

       --copy-source-if-none-match (string)
          Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag)  is  different  than  the
          specified ETag.

       --copy-source-if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Copies  the  object  if  it hasn't been modified since the specified
          time.

       --expires (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

       --grant-full-control (string)
          Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions  on  the
          object.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read (string)
          Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to read the object ACL.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-write-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --key (string)
          The key of the destination object.

       --metadata (map)
          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --metadata-directive (string)
          Specifies  whether  the metadata is copied from the source object or
          replaced with metadata provided in the request.

          Possible values:

          o COPY

          o REPLACE

       --tagging-directive (string)
          Specifies whether the object tag-set  are  copied  from  the  source
          object or replaced with tag-set provided in the request.

          Possible values:

          o COPY

          o REPLACE

       --server-side-encryption (string)
          The  server-side  encryption algorithm used when storing this object
          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

          Possible values:

          o AES256

          o aws:kms

       --storage-class (string)
          By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
          created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability
          and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can spec-
          ify  a  different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the
          OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o REDUCED_REDUNDANCY

          o STANDARD_IA

          o ONEZONE_IA

          o INTELLIGENT_TIERING

          o GLACIER

          o DEEP_ARCHIVE

          o OUTPOSTS

          o GLACIER_IR

       --website-redirect-location (string)
          If  the  bucket  is  configured as a website, redirects requests for
          this object to another object in the same bucket or to  an  external
          URL.  Amazon  S3 stores the value of this header in the object meta-
          data.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting  the  object  (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and  then
          it  is  discarded;  Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The
          key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in  the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --ssekms-key-id (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  key ID to use for object
          encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Ama-
          zon  Web  Services KMS will fail if not made via SSL or using SigV4.
          For information about configuring using any of the  officially  sup-
          ported  Amazon  Web  Services  SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see
          Specifying the Signature Version in Request  Authentication  in  the
          Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --ssekms-encryption-context (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for
          object encryption. The value of  this  header  is  a  base64-encoded
          UTF-8  string  holding  JSON  with  the encryption context key-value
          pairs.

       --bucket-key-enabled | --no-bucket-key-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key  for  object
          encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Set-
          ting this header to true causes Amazon S3 to use an  S3  Bucket  Key
          for object encryption with SSE-KMS.

          Specifying this header with a COPY action doesnt affect bucket-level
          settings for S3 Bucket Key.

       --copy-source-sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use when  decrypting  the  source  object
          (for example, AES256).

       --copy-source-sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          to decrypt the source object. The encryption key  provided  in  this
          header must be one that was used when the source object was created.

       --copy-source-sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according  to
          RFC  1321.  Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket  owners  need  not  specify this parameter in their
          requests. For information about downloading objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --tagging (string)
          The tag-set for the object destination object  this  value  must  be
          used  in conjunction with the TaggingDirective . The tag-set must be
          encoded as URL Query parameters.

       --object-lock-mode (string)
          The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the copied object.

          Possible values:

          o GOVERNANCE

          o COMPLIANCE

       --object-lock-retain-until-date (timestamp)
          The date and time when you want the copied object's Object  Lock  to
          expire.

       --object-lock-legal-hold-status (string)
          Specifies  whether  you  want  to  apply  a Legal Hold to the copied
          object.

          Possible values:

          o ON

          o OFF

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the des-
          tination  bucket  is  owned by a different account, the request will
          fail with an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error.

       --expected-source-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected source bucket owner.  If  the  source
          bucket  is  owned by a different account, the request will fail with
          an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command copies an object from bucket-1 to bucket-2:

          aws s3api copy-object --copy-source bucket-1/test.txt --key test.txt --bucket bucket-2

       Output:

          {
              "CopyObjectResult": {
                  "LastModified": "2015-11-10T01:07:25.000Z",
                  "ETag": "\"589c8b79c230a6ecd5a7e1d040a9a030\""
              },

          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

       SSECustomerAlgorithm -> (string)
          If  server-side  encryption  with a customer-provided encryption key
          was requested, the response will include this header confirming  the
          encryption algorithm used.

       SSECustomerKeyMD5 -> (string)
          If  server-side  encryption  with a customer-provided encryption key
          was requested, the response will  include  this  header  to  provide
          round-trip  message  integrity verification of the customer-provided
          encryption key.

       SSEKMSKeyId -> (string)
          If present, specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key  Manage-
          ment  Service  (Amazon  Web Services KMS) symmetric customer managed
          key that was used for the object.

       SSEKMSEncryptionContext -> (string)
          If present, specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context
          to  use  for  object  encryption.  The  value  of  this  header is a
          base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON with the encryption context
          key-value pairs.

       BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the  copied  object  uses  an  S3 Bucket Key for
          server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS (SSE-KMS).

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.
