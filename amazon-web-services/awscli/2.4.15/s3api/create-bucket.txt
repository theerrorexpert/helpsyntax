CREATE-BUCKET()                                                CREATE-BUCKET()



NAME
       create-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  S3  bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with
       Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authen-
       ticate  requests.  Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buck-
       ets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

       Not every string is an acceptable bucket name.  For  information  about
       bucket naming restrictions, see Bucket naming rules .

       If  you  want  to  create  an  Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see Create
       Bucket .

       By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia)  Region.
       You  can  optionally  specify  a  Region in the request body. You might
       choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regula-
       tory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will prob-
       ably find it advantageous to create buckets  in  the  Europe  (Ireland)
       Region. For more information, see Accessing a bucket .

       NOTE:
              If  you  send your create bucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com
              endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly,
              the  signature  calculations  in  Signature  Version  4 must use
              us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in  the
              request  specifies another Region where the bucket is to be cre-
              ated. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East  (N.
              Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect.
              For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets .

          Access control lists (ACLs)

       When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally config-
       ure  the  bucket  ACL  to specify the accounts or groups that should be
       granted specific permissions on the bucket.

       WARNING:
          If your CreateBucket request  sets  bucket  owner  enforced  for  S3
          Object  Ownership and specifies a bucket ACL that provides access to
          an external Amazon Web Services account, your request fails  with  a
          400  error and returns the InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership error
          code. For more information, see Controlling object ownership in  the
          Amazon S3 User Guide .

       There  are  two  ways  to  grant  the appropriate permissions using the
       request headers.

       o Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request  header.  Amazon  S3
         supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs . Each canned
         ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more infor-
         mation, see Canned ACL .

       o Specify  access  permissions  explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read ,
         x-amz-grant-write , x-amz-grant-read-acp  ,  x-amz-grant-write-acp  ,
         and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of
         permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more  information,  see
         Access  control  list  (ACL) overview . You specify each grantee as a
         type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

         o id  if the value specified is the canonical user ID  of  an  Amazon
           Web Services account

         o uri  if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

         o emailAddress   if  the  value  specified is the email address of an
           Amazon Web Services account

         NOTE:
                Using email addresses to specify a grantee is  only  supported
                in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:

                   o US East (N. Virginia)

                   o US West (N. California)

                   o US West (Oregon)

                   o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                   o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                   o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                   o Europe (Ireland)

                   o South America (So Paulo)

            For  a  list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
            see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General  Ref-
            erence.

       For  example,  the  following x-amz-grant-read header grants the Amazon
       Web Services accounts identified by account  IDs  permissions  to  read
       object data and its metadata:
          x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"

       NOTE:
              You  can  use  either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
              explicitly. You cannot do both.

          Permissions

       In addition to s3:CreateBucket , the following permissions are required
       when your CreateBucket includes specific headers:

       o ACLs - If your CreateBucket request specifies ACL permissions and the
         ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if  you
         specify  access  permissions  explicitly  through any other ACL, both
         s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl permissions are  needed.  If  the
         ACL  the CreateBucket request is private or doesn't specify any ACLs,
         only s3:CreateBucket permission is needed.

       o Object Lock - If ObjectLockEnabledForBucket is set to  true  in  your
         CreateBucket request, s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration and s3:Put-
         BucketVersioning permissions are required.

       o S3 Object Ownership - If your CreateBucket request includes  the  the
         x-amz-object-ownership  header, s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls permis-
         sion is required.

       The following operations are related to CreateBucket :

       o PutObject

       o DeleteBucket

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LocationConstraint=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LocationConstraint": "af-south-1"|"ap-east-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"ap-northeast-3"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ca-central-1"|"cn-north-1"|"cn-northwest-1"|"EU"|"eu-central-1"|"eu-north-1"|"eu-south-1"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"me-south-1"|"sa-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-gov-east-1"|"us-gov-west-1"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"

          on the bucket.

       --grant-read (string)
          Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket.

       --grant-read-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL.

       --grant-write (string)
          Allows grantee to create new objects in the bucket.

          For  the  bucket  and object owners of existing objects, also allows
          deletions and overwrites of those objects.

       --grant-write-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucket.

       --object-lock-enabled-for-bucket |  --no-object-lock-enabled-for-bucket
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether you want S3 Object Lock to be enabled for the new
          bucket.

       --object-ownership (string)
          The container element for object ownership for a bucket's  ownership
          controls.

          BucketOwnerPreferred  - Objects uploaded to the bucket change owner-
          ship to the bucket owner  if  the  objects  are  uploaded  with  the
          bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL.

          ObjectWriter  -  The  uploading  account  will own the object if the
          object is uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL.

          BucketOwnerEnforced - Access control lists (ACLs) are  disabled  and
          no  longer  affect  permissions. The bucket owner automatically owns
          and has full control over every object in  the  bucket.  The  bucket
          only  accepts PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or bucket owner
          full control ACLs, such as the bucket-owner-full-control canned  ACL
          or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format.

          Possible values:

          o BucketOwnerPreferred

          o ObjectWriter

          o BucketOwnerEnforced

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a bucket

       The following create-bucket example creates a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api create-bucket \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "Location": "/my-bucket"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Creating  a  bucket in the Amazon S3 User
       Guide.

       Example 2: To create a bucket with owner enforced

       The following create-bucket example creates a  bucket  named  my-bucket
       that uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership.

          aws s3api create-bucket \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --object-ownership BucketOwnerEnforced

       Output:

          {
              "Location": "/my-bucket"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Controlling ownership of objects and dis-
       abling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

       Example 3: To create a bucket outside of the ``us-east-1`` region

       The following create-bucket example creates a bucket named my-bucket in
       the  eu-west-1  region. Regions outside of us-east-1 require the appro-
       priate LocationConstraint to be specified in order to create the bucket
       in the desired region.

          aws s3api create-bucket \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --region eu-west-1 \
              --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-west-1

       Output:

          {
              "Location": "http://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Creating  a  bucket in the Amazon S3 User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       Location -> (string)
          Specifies the Region where the bucket will be created.  If  you  are
          creating  a  bucket on the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1),
          you do not need to specify the location.
