PUT-OBJECT-TAGGING()                                      PUT-OBJECT-TAGGING()



NAME
       put-object-tagging -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the supplied tag-set to an object that already exists in a bucket.

       A tag is a key-value pair. You can associate tags  with  an  object  by
       sending  a  PUT request against the tagging subresource that is associ-
       ated with the object. You can retrieve tags by sending a  GET  request.
       For more information, see GetObjectTagging .

       For  tagging-related  restrictions related to characters and encodings,
       see Tag Restrictions . Note that Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of
       tags to 10 tags per object.

       To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:PutO-
       bjectTagging action. By default, the bucket owner has  this  permission
       and can grant this permission to others.

       To  put  tags  of any other version, use the versionId query parameter.
       You also need permission for the s3:PutObjectVersionTagging action.

       For information about the Amazon S3 object tagging feature, see  Object
       Tagging .

         o Code: InvalidTagError

         o Cause:  The  tag provided was not a valid tag. This error can occur
           if the tag did not pass input validation. For more information, see
           `Object      Tagging     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/lat-
           est/dev/object-tagging.html>`__ .

       o

         o Code: MalformedXMLError

         o Cause: The XML provided does not match the schema.

SYNOPSIS
            put-object-tagging
          --bucket <value>
          --key <value>
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          --tagging <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name containing the object.

          When using this  action  with  an  access  point,  you  must  direct
          requests  to  the  access  point hostname. The access point hostname
          takes the form AccessPointName  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through
          the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access  point  ARN  in
          place  of  the  bucket name. For more information about access point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --key (string)
          Name of the object key.

       --version-id (string)
          The versionId of the object that the tag-set will be added to.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash for the request body.

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs,  this  field  is  calculated
          automatically.

       --tagging (structure)
          Container for the TagSet and Tag elements

          TagSet -> (list)
              A collection for a set of tags

              (structure)
                 A container of a key value name pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagSet=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TagSet": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not  specify  this  parameter  in  their
          requests.  For  information about downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set a tag on an object

       The following put-object-tagging example sets a tag with the key desig-
       nation and the value confidential on the specified object.

          aws s3api put-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc1.rtf \
              --tagging '{"TagSet": [{ "Key": "designation", "Value": "confidential" }]}'

       This command produces no output.

       The following put-object-tagging example sets multiple tags sets on the
       specified object.

          aws s3api put-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket-example \
              --key doc3.rtf \
              --tagging '{"TagSet": [{ "Key": "designation", "Value": "confidential" }, { "Key": "department", "Value": "finance" }, { "Key": "team", "Value": "payroll" } ]}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       VersionId -> (string)
          The versionId of the object the tag-set was added to.
