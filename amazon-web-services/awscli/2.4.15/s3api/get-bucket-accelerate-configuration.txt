GET-BUCKET-ACCELERATE-CONFIGURATION()    GET-BUCKET-ACCELERATE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-bucket-accelerate-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       This  implementation  of the GET action uses the accelerate subresource
       to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is  either
       Enabled   or   Suspended   .  Amazon  S3  Transfer  Acceleration  is  a
       bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data  transfers
       to and from Amazon S3.

       To  use  this  operation,  you  must  have  permission  to  perform the
       s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permis-
       sion  by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.
       For more information about  permissions,  see  Permissions  Related  to
       Bucket  Subresource  Operations and Managing Access Permissions to your
       Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       You set the Transfer  Acceleration  state  of  an  existing  bucket  to
       Enabled  or  Suspended  by  using  the PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration
       operation.

       A GET accelerate request does not return a state  value  for  a  bucket
       that  has  no  transfer  acceleration  state.  A bucket has no Transfer
       Acceleration state if a state has never been set on the bucket.

       For more information about transfer acceleration, see Transfer Acceler-
       ation in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-accelerate-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name  of  the  bucket for which the accelerate configuration is
          retrieved.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the accelerate configuration of a bucket

       The following get-bucket-accelerate-configuration example retrieves the
       accelerate configuration for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api get-bucket-accelerate-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "Status": "Enabled"
          }

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The accelerate configuration of the bucket.
