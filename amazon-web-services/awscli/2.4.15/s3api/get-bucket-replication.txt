GET-BUCKET-REPLICATION()                              GET-BUCKET-REPLICATION()



NAME
       get-bucket-replication -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.

       NOTE:
          It  can  take  a  while to propagate the put or delete a replication
          configuration to all Amazon S3 systems.  Therefore,  a  get  request
          soon after put or delete can return a wrong result.

       For information about replication configuration, see Replication in the
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

       This action requires permissions for the s3:GetReplicationConfiguration
       action.  For more information about permissions, see Using Bucket Poli-
       cies and User Policies .

       If you include the Filter element in a replication  configuration,  you
       must  also  include  the DeleteMarkerReplication and Priority elements.
       The response also returns those elements.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-replication
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the replication information.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  retrieves  the replication configuration for a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-replication --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "ReplicationConfiguration": {
                  "Rules": [
                      {
                          "Status": "Enabled",
                          "Prefix": "",
                          "Destination": {
                              "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-backup",
                              "StorageClass": "STANDARD"
                          },
                          "ID": "ZmUwNzE4ZmQ4tMjVhOS00MTlkLOGI4NDkzZTIWJjNTUtYTA1"
                      }
                  ],
                  "Role": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/s3-replication-role"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ReplicationConfiguration -> (structure)
          A container for replication rules. You can add up  to  1,000  rules.
          The maximum size of a replication configuration is 2 MB.

          Role -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Man-
              agement (IAM) role  that  Amazon  S3  assumes  when  replicating
              objects.  For more information, see How to Set Up Replication in
              the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Rules -> (list)
              A container for one or more  replication  rules.  A  replication
              configuration must have at least one rule and can contain a max-
              imum of 1,000 rules.

              (structure)
                 Specifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and  where  to
                 store the replicas.

                 ID -> (string)
                     A  unique  identifier  for the rule. The maximum value is
                     255 characters.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever
                     two  or  more  replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will
                     attempt to replicate objects according to all replication
                     rules.  However,  if there are two or more rules with the
                     same destination bucket, then objects will be  replicated
                     according  to  the  rule  with  the highest priority. The
                     higher the number, the higher the priority.

                     For more information, see Replication in  the  Amazon  S3
                     User Guide .

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An  object  key name prefix that identifies the object or
                     objects to which the rule  applies.  The  maximum  prefix
                     length  is  1,024 characters. To include all objects in a
                     bucket, specify an empty string.

                     WARNING:
                        Replacement must be made for  object  keys  containing
                        special  characters  (such  as  carriage returns) when
                        using XML requests.  For  more  information,  see  XML
                        related object key constraints .

                 Filter -> (structure)
                     A  filter  that identifies the subset of objects to which
                     the replication  rule  applies.  A  Filter  must  specify
                     exactly one Prefix , Tag , or an And child element.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        An  object  key name prefix that identifies the subset
                        of objects to which the rule applies.

                        WARNING:
                            Replacement must be made for object keys  contain-
                            ing  special characters (such as carriage returns)
                            when using XML requests. For more information, see
                            XML related object key constraints .

                     Tag -> (structure)
                        A container for specifying a tag key and value.

                        The  rule applies only to objects that have the tag in
                        their tag set.

                        Key -> (string)
                            Name of the object key.

                        Value -> (string)
                            Value of the tag.

                     And -> (structure)
                        A container for specifying rule filters.  The  filters
                        determine  the  subset  of  objects  to which the rule
                        applies. This element is required only if you  specify
                        more than one filter. For example:

                        o If  you specify both a Prefix and a Tag filter, wrap
                          these filters in an And tag.

                        o If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap
                          the Tag elements in an And tag.

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            An object key name prefix that identifies the sub-
                            set of objects to which the rule applies.

                        Tags -> (list)
                            An array of tags containing key and value pairs.

                            (structure)
                               A container of a key value name pair.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   Name of the object key.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   Value of the tag.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the rule is enabled.

                 SourceSelectionCriteria -> (structure)
                     A container that describes additional filters for identi-
                     fying  the source objects that you want to replicate. You
                     can choose to enable or disable the replication of  these
                     objects.  Currently,  Amazon  S3 supports only the filter
                     that you can specify for objects created with server-side
                     encryption  using a customer managed key stored in Amazon
                     Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).

                     SseKmsEncryptedObjects -> (structure)
                        A container for filter information for  the  selection
                        of  Amazon  S3  objects encrypted with Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices KMS. If you include  SourceSelectionCriteria  in
                        the   replication   configuration,   this  element  is
                        required.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies whether  Amazon  S3  replicates  objects
                            created  with server-side encryption using an Ama-
                            zon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices Key Management Service.

                     ReplicaModifications -> (structure)
                        A filter that you can specify for selections for modi-
                        fications on replicas.  Amazon  S3  doesn't  replicate
                        replica  modifications  by default. In the latest ver-
                        sion of  replication  configuration  (when  Filter  is
                        specified),  you  can specify this element and set the
                        status to Enabled to replicate modifications on repli-
                        cas.

                        NOTE:
                            If you don't specify the Filter element, Amazon S3
                            assumes that the replication configuration is  the
                            earlier  version, V1. In the earlier version, this
                            element is not allowed

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies whether Amazon S3  replicates  modifica-
                            tions on replicas.

                 ExistingObjectReplication -> (structure)
                     Status -> (string)

                 Destination -> (structure)
                     A  container for information about the replication desti-
                     nation and its configurations including enabling  the  S3
                     Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).

                     Bucket -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket where you
                        want Amazon S3 to store the results.

                     Account -> (string)
                        Destination   bucket   owner   account   ID.   In    a
                        cross-account  scenario,  if  you  direct Amazon S3 to
                        change replica ownership to the  Amazon  Web  Services
                        account that owns the destination bucket by specifying
                        the AccessControlTranslation  property,  this  is  the
                        account  ID  of the destination bucket owner. For more
                        information, see Replication Additional Configuration:
                        Changing the Replica Owner in the Amazon S3 User Guide
                        .

                     StorageClass -> (string)
                        The storage class to  use  when  replicating  objects,
                        such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default,
                        Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source  object
                        to create the object replica.

                        For  valid values, see the StorageClass element of the
                        PUT Bucket replication action in  the  Amazon  S3  API
                        Reference .

                     AccessControlTranslation -> (structure)
                        Specify  this  only in a cross-account scenario (where
                        source and  destination  bucket  owners  are  not  the
                        same), and you want to change replica ownership to the
                        Amazon Web Services account that owns the  destination
                        bucket.  If  this  is not specified in the replication
                        configuration, the replicas are owned by  same  Amazon
                        Web Services account that owns the source object.

                        Owner -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  replica ownership. For default and
                            valid values, see PUT bucket  replication  in  the
                            Amazon S3 API Reference .

                     EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                        A  container  that  provides information about encryp-
                        tion. If  SourceSelectionCriteria  is  specified,  you
                        must specify this element.

                        ReplicaKmsKeyID -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  ID  (Key  ARN or Alias ARN) of the
                            customer  managed  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  key
                            stored  in Amazon Web Services Key Management Ser-
                            vice (KMS) for the destination bucket.  Amazon  S3
                            uses  this  key to encrypt replica objects. Amazon
                            S3 only supports symmetric, customer  managed  KMS
                            keys.  For  more  information, see Using symmetric
                            and asymmetric keys in the Amazon Web Services Key
                            Management Service Developer Guide .

                     ReplicationTime -> (structure)
                        A container specifying S3 Replication Time Control (S3
                        RTC), including whether S3 RTC is enabled and the time
                        when  all  objects  and  operations on objects must be
                        replicated. Must be specified together with a  Metrics
                        block.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies whether the replication time is enabled.

                        Time -> (structure)
                            A container specifying the time by which  replica-
                            tion should be complete for all objects and opera-
                            tions on objects.

                            Minutes -> (integer)
                               Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                     Metrics -> (structure)
                        A  container  specifying  replication  metrics-related
                        settings enabling replication metrics and events.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether  the  replication  metrics  are
                            enabled.

                        EventThreshold -> (structure)
                            A  container  specifying  the  time  threshold for

                 DeleteMarkerReplication -> (structure)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If
                     you  specify  a Filter in your replication configuration,
                     you must also include a DeleteMarkerReplication  element.
                     If  your Filter includes a Tag element, the DeleteMarker-
                     Replication  Status must be set to Disabled, because Ama-
                     zon  S3  does  not support replicating delete markers for
                     tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see  Basic
                     Rule Configuration .

                     For more information about delete marker replication, see
                     Basic Rule Configuration .

                     NOTE:
                        If you are using an earlier version of the replication
                        configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete
                        markers  differently.  For   more   information,   see
                        Backward Compatibility .

                     Status -> (string)
                        Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

                        NOTE:
                            Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.
