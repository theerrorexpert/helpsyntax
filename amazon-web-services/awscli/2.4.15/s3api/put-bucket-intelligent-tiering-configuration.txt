PUT-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIERING-CPUT-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIERING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Puts  a  S3  Intelligent-Tiering configuration to the specified bucket.
       You can have up to  1,000  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  configurations  per
       bucket.

       The  S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize stor-
       age costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective stor-
       age access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3
       Intelligent-Tiering  delivers  automatic  cost  savings  in  three  low
       latency  and  high  throughput  access tiers. To get the lowest storage
       cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you  can  choose
       to activate additional archiving capabilities.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for
       data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, indepen-
       dent  of  object  size or retention period. If the size of an object is
       less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible  for  auto-tier-
       ing.  Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the
       Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

       For  more  information,  see Storage class for automatically optimizing
       frequently and infrequently accessed objects .

       NOTE:
              You  only need S3 Intelligent-Tiering enabled on a bucket if you
              want to automatically move objects stored  in  the  S3  Intelli-
              gent-Tiering storage class to the Archive Access or Deep Archive
              Access tier.

          Special Errors

            put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --id <value>
          --intelligent-tiering-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name  of  the  Amazon S3 bucket whose configuration you want to
          modify or retrieve.

       --id (string)
          The ID used to identify the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.

       --intelligent-tiering-configuration (structure)
          Container for S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID used to identify the  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  configura-
              tion.

          Filter -> (structure)
              Specifies  a  bucket  filter.  The  configuration  only includes
              objects that meet the filter's criteria.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 An object key name  prefix  that  identifies  the  subset  of
                 objects to which the rule applies.

                 WARNING:
                     Replacement  must be made for object keys containing spe-
                     cial characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML
                     requests.  For  more  information, see XML related object
                     key constraints .

              Tag -> (structure)
                 A container of a key value name pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

              And -> (structure)
                 A conjunction (logical AND) of predicates, which is  used  in
                 evaluating  a metrics filter. The operator must have at least
                 two predicates, and an object must match all  of  the  predi-
                 cates in order for the filter to apply.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An  object  key name prefix that identifies the subset of
                     objects to which the configuration applies.

                 Tags -> (list)
                     All of these tags must exist in the object's tag  set  in
                     order for the configuration to apply.

                     (structure)
                        A container of a key value name pair.

                        Key -> (string)

                            Value of the tag.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the status of the configuration.

          Tierings -> (list)
              Specifies  the  S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class tier of the
              configuration.

              (structure)
                 The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to opti-
                 mize  storage  costs by automatically moving data to the most
                 cost-effective storage access tier, without additional opera-
                 tional overhead.

                 Days -> (integer)
                     The  number  of consecutive days of no access after which
                     an object will be eligible to be transitioned to the cor-
                     responding tier. The minimum number of days specified for
                     Archive Access tier must be at least 90 days and Deep Ar-
                     chive  Access tier must be at least 180 days. The maximum
                     can be up to 2 years (730 days).

                 AccessTier -> (string)
                     S3 Intelligent-Tiering access tier. See Storage class for
                     automatically   optimizing  frequently  and  infrequently
                     accessed objects for a list of access  tiers  in  the  S3
                     Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
