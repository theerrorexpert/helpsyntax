PUT-BUCKET-METRICS-CONFIGURATION()          PUT-BUCKET-METRICS-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-metrics-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  a  metrics  configuration (specified by the metrics configuration
       ID) for the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 metrics configurations per
       bucket. If you're updating an existing metrics configuration, note that
       this is a full replacement of the existing  metrics  configuration.  If
       you don't include the elements you want to keep, they are erased.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Put-
       MetricsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has  this  permission  by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source  Operations  and  Managing  Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
       Resources .

         o Description: You are attempting to create a new  configuration  but

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-metrics-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --id <value>
          --metrics-configuration <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which the metrics configuration is set.

       --id (string)
          The ID used to identify the metrics configuration.

       --metrics-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the metrics configuration.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID used to identify the metrics configuration.

          Filter -> (structure)
              Specifies a metrics configuration filter. The metrics configura-
              tion will only include objects that meet the filter's  criteria.
              A  filter  must be a prefix, an object tag, an access point ARN,
              or a conjunction (MetricsAndOperator).

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix used when evaluating a metrics filter.

              Tag -> (structure)
                 The tag used when evaluating a metrics filter.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

              AccessPointArn -> (string)
                 The access point ARN used when evaluating a metrics filter.

              And -> (structure)
                 A conjunction (logical AND) of predicates, which is  used  in
                 evaluating  a metrics filter. The operator must have at least
                 two predicates, and an object must match all  of  the  predi-
                 cates in order for the filter to apply.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix used when evaluating an AND predicate.

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The list of tags used when evaluating an AND predicate.

                     (structure)
                        A container of a key value name pair.

                        Key -> (string)
                            Name of the object key.

                        Value -> (string)
                            Value of the tag.

                 AccessPointArn -> (string)
                     The  access  point ARN used when evaluating an AND predi-
                     cate.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Id": "string",
            "Filter": {
              "Prefix": "string",
              "Tag": {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              },
              "AccessPointArn": "string",
              "And": {
                "Prefix": "string",
                "Tags": [
                  {
                    "Key": "string",
                    "Value": "string"
                  }
                  ...
                ],
                "AccessPointArn": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set a metrics configuration for a bucket

       The following put-bucket-metrics-configuration example  sets  a  metric
       configuration with ID 123 for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-metrics-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --id 123 \
              --metrics-configuration '{"Id": "123", "Filter": {"Prefix": "logs"}}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
