PUT-OBJECT-LOCK-CONFIGURATION()                PUT-OBJECT-LOCK-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-object-lock-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Places  an  Object Lock configuration on the specified bucket. The rule
       specified in the Object Lock configuration will be applied  by  default
       to  every  new object placed in the specified bucket. For more informa-
       tion, see Locking Objects .

       NOTE:

          o The DefaultRetention settings require both a mode and a period.

          o The DefaultRetention period can be either Days or  Years  but  you
            must  select  one.  You  cannot specify Days and Years at the same
            time.

          o You can only enable Object Lock for new buckets. If  you  want  to
            turn  on  Object  Lock  for an existing bucket, contact Amazon Web
            Services Support.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket whose Object Lock configuration you  want  to  create  or
          replace.

       --object-lock-configuration (structure)
          The  Object  Lock configuration that you want to apply to the speci-
          fied bucket.

          ObjectLockEnabled -> (string)
              Indicates whether this bucket has an Object  Lock  configuration

              figuration to a bucket.

          Rule -> (structure)
              Specifies the Object Lock rule for the specified object.  Enable
              the  this  rule  when  you  apply  ObjectLockConfiguration  to a
              bucket. Bucket settings require both a mode and  a  period.  The
              period  can be either Days or Years but you must select one. You
              cannot specify Days and Years at the same time.

              DefaultRetention -> (structure)
                 The default Object Lock retention mode and  period  that  you
                 want  to apply to new objects placed in the specified bucket.

                     The number of days that  you  want  to  specify  for  the

                 Years -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  years  that  you want to specify for the

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ObjectLockEnabled=string,Rule={DefaultRetention={Mode=string,Days=integer,Years=integer}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled",
            "Rule": {
              "DefaultRetention": {
                "Mode": "GOVERNANCE"|"COMPLIANCE",
                "Days": integer,
                "Years": integer
              }
            }
          }

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket  owners  need  not  specify this parameter in their
          requests. For information about downloading objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --token (string)
          A token to allow Object Lock to be enabled for an existing bucket.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash for the request body.

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face  (CLI)  or  Amazon  Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated
          automatically.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set an object lock configuration on a bucket

       The  following  put-object-lock-configuration  example  sets  a  50-day
       object lock on the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket-with-object-lock \
              --object-lock-configuration '{ "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled", "Rule": { "DefaultRetention": { "Mode": "COMPLIANCE", "Days": 50 }}}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.
