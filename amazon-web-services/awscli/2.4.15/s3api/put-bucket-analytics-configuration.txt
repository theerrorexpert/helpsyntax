PUT-BUCKET-ANALYTICS-CONFIGURATION()      PUT-BUCKET-ANALYTICS-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-analytics-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  an  analytics configuration for the bucket (specified by the ana-
       lytics configuration ID). You can have up to 1,000 analytics configura-
       tions per bucket.

       You  can  choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports
       sent to a comma-separated values (CSV) flat file.  See  the  DataExport
       request  element. Reports are updated daily and are based on the object
       filters that you configure. When selecting data export, you  specify  a
       destination bucket and an optional destination prefix where the file is
       written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different
       account.  However, the destination bucket must be in the same Region as
       the bucket that you are making the PUT analytics configuration to.  For
       more information, see Amazon S3 Analytics  Storage Class Analysis .

       WARNING:
          You  must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket where the
          exported file is written to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to  write
          objects  to  the bucket. For an example policy, see Granting Permis-
          sions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis .

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Put-
       AnalyticsConfiguration  action. The bucket owner has this permission by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions  to  Your  Amazon  S3
       Resources .

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)

          stored.

       --id (string)

          Filter -> (structure)
              The  filter  used  to  describe a set of objects for analyses. A
              filter must have exactly one prefix, one tag, or one conjunction
              (AnalyticsAndOperator).  If  no  filter is provided, all objects
              will be considered in any analysis.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix to use when evaluating an analytics filter.

              Tag -> (structure)

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix to use when evaluating an AND  predicate:  The

                     metrics results.

                 Tags -> (list)

              age classes.

              DataExport -> (structure)
                 Specifies  how data related to the storage class analysis for
                 an Amazon S3 bucket should be exported.

                 OutputSchemaVersion -> (string)
                     The version of the output schema to  use  when  exporting
                     data. Must be V_1 .

                            NOTE:
                               Although this value is  optional,  we  strongly
                               recommend that you set it to help prevent prob-
                               lems  if  the  destination   bucket   ownership
                               changes.

                    "Prefix": "string"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To sets an analytics configuration for the bucket

       The  following  put-bucket-analytics-configuration  example  configures
       analytics for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-analytics-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket --id 1 \
              --analytics-configuration '{"Id": "1","StorageClassAnalysis": {}}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
