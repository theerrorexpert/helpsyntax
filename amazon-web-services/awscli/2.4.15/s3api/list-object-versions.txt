LIST-OBJECT-VERSIONS()                                  LIST-OBJECT-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-object-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata about all versions of the objects in a bucket. You can
       also use request parameters as selection criteria  to  return  metadata
       about a subset of all the object versions.

       WARNING:
          To  use  this  operation,  you  must have permissions to perform the
          s3:ListBucketVersions action. Be aware of the name difference.

       NOTE:
          A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid  XML.  Make  sure  to
          design  your  application  to parse the contents of the response and
          handle it appropriately.

       To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       The following operations are related to ListObjectVersions :

       o ListObjectsV2

       o GetObject

       o PutObject

       o DeleteObject

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-object-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Versions, DeleteMarkers, CommonPrefixes

SYNOPSIS
            list-object-versions
          --bucket <value>
          [--delimiter <value>]
          [--encoding-type <value>]
          [--prefix <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name that contains the objects.

       --delimiter (string)
          A  delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys
          that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occur-
          rence  of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in
          CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result  against  the
          max-keys  limitation.  These  keys are not returned elsewhere in the
          response.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys  in  the  response  and
          specifies  the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any
          Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some charac-
          ters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For char-
          acters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter
          to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Use  this  parameter  to  select only those keys that begin with the
          specified prefix. You can use prefixes to  separate  a  bucket  into
          different  groupings of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
          groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.) You can
          use  prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a single
          result under CommonPrefixes.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following command retrieves version information for an object in a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket my-bucket --prefix index.html

       Output:

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether Amazon S3 returned all of the  results
          that  satisfied the search criteria. If your results were truncated,
          you can make a follow-up paginated request using  the  NextKeyMarker
          and  NextVersionIdMarker  response parameters as a starting place in
          another request to return the rest of the results.

       KeyMarker -> (string)
          Marks the last key returned in a truncated response.

       VersionIdMarker -> (string)
          Marks the last version of the key returned in a truncated  response.

       NextKeyMarker -> (string)
          When the number of responses exceeds the value of MaxKeys , NextKey-
          Marker specifies the first  key  not  returned  that  satisfies  the
          search criteria. Use this value for the key-marker request parameter
          in a subsequent request.

       NextVersionIdMarker -> (string)
          When the number of responses exceeds the value of MaxKeys , NextVer-
          sionIdMarker  specifies  the  first object version not returned that
          satisfies  the  search  criteria.  Use  this  value  for  the   ver-
          sion-id-marker request parameter in a subsequent request.

       Versions -> (list)
          Container for version information.

          (structure)
              The version of an object.

              ETag -> (string)
                 The  entity tag is an MD5 hash of that version of the object.

              Size -> (integer)
                 Size in bytes of the object.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

              Key -> (string)
                 The object key.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 Version ID of an object.

              IsLatest -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the object is (true) or is not (false)  the
                 latest version of an object.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time the object was last modified.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 Specifies the owner of the object.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container for the display name of the owner.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

       DeleteMarkers -> (list)
          Container for an object that is a delete marker.

          (structure)
              Information about the delete marker.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 The account that created the delete marker.>

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container for the display name of the owner.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

              Key -> (string)
                 The object key.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 Version ID of an object.

              IsLatest -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether the object is (true) or is not (false) the
                 latest version of an object.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time the object was last modified.

       Name -> (string)
          The bucket name.

       Prefix -> (string)
          Selects objects that start with the value supplied by  this  parame-
          ter.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          The delimiter grouping the included keys. A delimiter is a character
          that you specify to group keys.  All  keys  that  contain  the  same
          string  between the prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter
          are grouped under a single result element in CommonPrefixes .  These
          groups  are  counted  as one result against the max-keys limitation.
          These keys are not returned elsewhere in the response.

       MaxKeys -> (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of objects to return.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          All of the keys rolled up into a common prefix  count  as  a  single
          return when calculating the number of returns.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter.  Common-
              Prefixes  lists  keys that act like subdirectories in the direc-
              tory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix  is  notes/
              and  the  delimiter  is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object key  names  in  the
          XML response.

          If  you  specify encoding-type request parameter, Amazon S3 includes
          this element in the response, and returns encoded key name values in
          the following response elements:
              KeyMarker, NextKeyMarker, Prefix, Key , and Delimiter .
