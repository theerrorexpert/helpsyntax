LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()                              LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()



NAME
       list-multipart-uploads -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress multi-
       part upload is a multipart upload that has  been  initiated  using  the
       Initiate  Multipart  Upload  request, but has not yet been completed or
       aborted.

       This action returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads  in  the  response.
       1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can
       include, which is also the default value. You  can  further  limit  the
       number of uploads in a response by specifying the max-uploads parameter
       in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list  cri-
       teria,  the response will contain an IsTruncated element with the value
       true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the key-marker  and
       upload-id-marker request parameters.

       In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has
       initiated more than one multipart upload using  the  same  object  key,
       then  uploads  in  the  response are first sorted by key. Additionally,
       uploads are sorted in ascending order within each  key  by  the  upload
       initiation time.

       For  more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using
       Multipart Upload .

       For information on permissions required to  use  the  multipart  upload
       API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions .

       list-multipart-uploads is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Uploads, CommonPrefixes

SYNOPSIS
            list-multipart-uploads
          --bucket <value>
          [--delimiter <value>]
          [--encoding-type <value>]
          [--prefix <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was  initiated.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --delimiter (string)
          Character you use to group keys.

          All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if  speci-
          fied, and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are
          grouped under a single result element, CommonPrefixes . If you don't
          specify  the  prefix  parameter,  then  the  substring starts at the
          beginning of the key. The keys that are grouped under CommonPrefixes
          result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Requests  Amazon  S3  to  encode the object keys in the response and
          specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain  any
          Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some charac-
          ters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For char-
          acters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter
          to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that  begin  with  the
          specified  prefix.  You  can  use prefixes to separate a bucket into
          different grouping of keys. (You can think of using prefix  to  make
          groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       In  progress  multipart  uploads incur storage costs in Amazon S3. Com-
       plete or abort an active multipart upload to remove its parts from your
       account.

OUTPUT
       Bucket -> (string)
          The  name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
          Does not return the access point ARN or access point alias if  used.

       KeyMarker -> (string)
          The key at or after which the listing began.

       UploadIdMarker -> (string)
          Upload ID after which listing began.

       NextKeyMarker -> (string)
          When  a  list  is  truncated,  this element specifies the value that
          should be used for the key-marker request parameter in a  subsequent
          request.

       Prefix -> (string)
          When  a  prefix  is provided in the request, this field contains the
          specified prefix. The result contains only keys  starting  with  the
          specified prefix.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          Contains  the  delimiter  you specified in the request. If you don't
          specify a delimiter in your request, this element is absent from the
          response.

       NextUploadIdMarker -> (string)
          When  a  list  is  truncated,  this element specifies the value that
          should be used for the upload-id-marker request parameter in a  sub-
          sequent request.

       MaxUploads -> (integer)
          Maximum number of multipart uploads that could have been included in
          the response.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the returned list of multipart  uploads  is  trun-
          cated.  A  value  of true indicates that the list was truncated. The
          list can be truncated if the number of multipart uploads exceeds the
          limit allowed or specified by max uploads.

       Uploads -> (list)
          Container  for  elements related to a particular multipart upload. A
          response can contain zero or more Upload elements.

          (structure)
              Container for the MultipartUpload for the Amazon S3 object.

              UploadId -> (string)
                 Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.

              Key -> (string)
                 Key of the object for which the multipart upload  was  initi-
                 ated.

              Initiated -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which the multipart upload was initiated.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the owner of the object that is part of the multi-
                 part upload.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container for the display name of the owner.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

              Initiator -> (structure)
                 Identifies who initiated the multipart upload.

                 ID -> (string)
                     If the principal is an Amazon Web  Services  account,  it
                     provides  the  Canonical  User ID. If the principal is an
                     IAM User, it provides a user ARN value.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Name of the Principal.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          If you specify a delimiter in the request, then the  result  returns
          each  distinct  key  prefix containing the delimiter in a CommonPre-
          fixes element. The distinct key prefixes are returned in the  Prefix
          child element.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter.  Common-
              Prefixes  lists  keys that act like subdirectories in the direc-
              tory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix  is  notes/
              and  the  delimiter  is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding type used by  Amazon  S3  to  encode  object  keys  in  the
          response.

          If  you  specify encoding-type request parameter, Amazon S3 includes
          this element in the response, and returns encoded key name values in
          the following response elements:
              Delimiter , KeyMarker , Prefix , NextKeyMarker , Key .
