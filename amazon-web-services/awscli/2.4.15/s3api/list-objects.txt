LIST-OBJECTS()                                                  LIST-OBJECTS()



NAME
       list-objects -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  some  or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket. You can
       use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset  of
       the objects in a bucket. A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid
       XML. Be sure to design your application to parse the  contents  of  the
       response and handle it appropriately.

       WARNING:
          This  action  has  been revised. We recommend that you use the newer
          version, ListObjectsV2 , when developing applications. For  backward
          compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support ListObjects .

       The following operations are related to ListObjects :

       o ListObjectsV2

       o GetObject

       o PutObject

       o CreateBucket

       o ListBuckets

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-objects is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Contents, CommonPrefixes

          [--delimiter <value>]
          [--encoding-type <value>]
          [--prefix <value>]
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the objects.

          When using this  action  with  an  access  point,  you  must  direct
          requests  to  the  access  point hostname. The access point hostname
          takes the form AccessPointName  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through
          the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access  point  ARN  in
          place  of  the  bucket name. For more information about access point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --delimiter (string)
          A delimiter is a character you use to group keys.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Requests  Amazon  S3  to  encode the object keys in the response and
          specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain  any
          Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some charac-
          ters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For char-
          acters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter
          to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for
          the list objects request. Bucket owners need not specify this param-
          eter in their requests.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  uses  the  list-objects command to display the
       names of all the objects in the specified bucket:

          aws s3api list-objects --bucket text-content --query 'Contents[].{Key: Key, Size: Size}'

       The  example  uses  the  --query  argument  to  filter  the  output  of
       list-objects down to the key value and size for each object

       For  more information about objects, see Working with Amazon S3 Objects
       in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether Amazon S3 returned all of the  results
          that satisfied the search criteria.

       Marker -> (string)
          Indicates  where in the bucket listing begins. Marker is included in
          the response if it was sent with the request.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When response is truncated (the IsTruncated  element  value  in  the
          response  is true), you can use the key name in this field as marker
          in the subsequent request to get next  set  of  objects.  Amazon  S3
          lists  objects  in alphabetical order Note: This element is returned
          only if you have delimiter request parameter specified. If  response
          does not include the NextMarker and it is truncated, you can use the
          value of the last Key in the response as the marker  in  the  subse-
          quent request to get the next set of object keys.

       Contents -> (list)
          Metadata about each object returned.

          (structure)
              An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key
                 to retrieve the object.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Creation date of the object.

              ETag -> (string)
                 The entity tag is a hash of the  object.  The  ETag  reflects
                 changes  only to the contents of an object, not its metadata.
                 The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object  data.
                 Whether  or  not  it is depends on how the object was created
                 and how it is encrypted as described below:

                 o Objects created by the PUT Object,  POST  Object,  or  Copy
                   operation,  or  through  the Amazon Web Services Management
                   Console, and are encrypted by  SSE-S3  or  plaintext,  have
                   ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o Objects  created  by  the  PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy
                   operation, or through the Amazon  Web  Services  Management
                   Console,  and are encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags
                   that are not an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o If an object is created by either the Multipart  Upload  or
                   Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regard-
                   less of the method of encryption.

              Size -> (integer)
                 Size in bytes of the object

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 The owner of the object

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container for the display name of the owner.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

       Name -> (string)
          The bucket name.

       Prefix -> (string)
          Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and  the
          first  occurrence  of  the  delimiter  to be rolled up into a single
          result element in the  CommonPrefixes  collection.  These  rolled-up
          keys  are  not  returned  elsewhere  in the response. Each rolled-up
          result counts as only one return against the MaxKeys value.

       MaxKeys -> (integer)
          The maximum number of keys returned in the response body.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          All of the keys (up to 1,000) rolled up in a common prefix count  as
          a single return when calculating the number of returns.

          A  response  can contain CommonPrefixes only if you specify a delim-
          iter.

          CommonPrefixes contains all (if there are any) keys  between  Prefix
          and the next occurrence of the string specified by the delimiter.

          CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the direc-
          tory specified by Prefix.

          For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter  is  a  slash
          (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. All
          of the keys that roll up into a common  prefix  count  as  a  single
          return when calculating the number of returns.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter.  Common-
              Prefixes  lists  keys that act like subdirectories in the direc-
              tory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix  is  notes/
              and  the  delimiter  is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding type used by  Amazon  S3  to  encode  object  keys  in  the
          response.
