PUT-BUCKET-REPLICATION()                              PUT-BUCKET-REPLICATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-replication -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  replication  configuration or replaces an existing one. For
       more information, see Replication in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       Specify the replication configuration  in  the  request  body.  In  the
       replication  configuration,  you  provide  the  name of the destination
       bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to  replicate  objects,  the
       IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf,
       and other relevant information.

       A replication configuration must include at least  one  rule,  and  can
       contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to
       replicate by filtering the objects in  the  source  bucket.  To  choose
       additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.

       To specify a subset of the objects in the  source  bucket  to  apply  a
       replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule ele-
       ment. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more
       object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configura-
       tion, you must also add the following elements: DeleteMarkerReplication
       , Status , and Priority .

       NOTE:
          If  you  are  using an earlier version of the replication configura-
          tion, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete  markers  differently.
          For more information, see Backward Compatibility .

       For  information  about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Using Ver-
       sioning .
          Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects

       By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest
       using  server-side  encryption  with  KMS keys. To replicate Amazon Web
       Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following:  SourceSelectionCri-
       teria , SseKmsEncryptedObjects , Status , EncryptionConfiguration , and
       ReplicaKmsKeyID . For information about replication configuration,  see
       Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys .

       For  information  on  PutBucketReplication errors, see List of replica-
       tion-related error codes
          Permissions

       To create a PutBucketReplication request, you must have  s3:PutReplica-
       tionConfiguration permissions for the bucket.

       By  default,  a  resource  owner,  in this case the Amazon Web Services
       account that created  the  bucket,  can  perform  this  operation.  The
       resource  owner can also grant others permissions to perform the opera-
       tion. For more information about permissions,  see  Specifying  Permis-
       sions  in  a  Policy  and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
       Resources .

       NOTE:
          To perform this operation, the user or role  performing  the  action
          must have the iam:PassRole permission.

       The following operations are related to PutBucketReplication :

       o GetBucketReplication

       o DeleteBucketReplication

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-replication
          --bucket <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          --replication-configuration <value>
          [--token <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. You must use this
          header as a message integrity check to verify that the request  body
          was not corrupted in transit. For more information, see RFC 1864 .

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs,  this  field  is  calculated
          automatically.

       --replication-configuration (structure)
          A  container  for  replication rules. You can add up to 1,000 rules.
          The maximum size of a replication configuration is 2 MB.

          Role -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and  Access  Man-
              agement  (IAM)  role  that  Amazon  S3  assumes when replicating
              objects. For more information, see How to Set Up Replication  in
              the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Rules -> (list)
              A  container  for  one  or more replication rules. A replication
              configuration must have at least one rule and can contain a max-
              imum of 1,000 rules.

              (structure)
                 Specifies  which  Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to
                 store the replicas.

                 ID -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the rule. The  maximum  value  is
                     255 characters.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever
                     two or more replication rules conflict.  Amazon  S3  will
                     attempt to replicate objects according to all replication
                     rules. However, if there are two or more rules  with  the
                     same  destination bucket, then objects will be replicated
                     according to the rule  with  the  highest  priority.  The
                     higher the number, the higher the priority.

                     For  more  information,  see Replication in the Amazon S3
                     User Guide .

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An object key name prefix that identifies the  object  or
                     objects  to  which  the  rule applies. The maximum prefix
                     length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects  in  a
                     bucket, specify an empty string.

                     WARNING:
                        Replacement  must  be  made for object keys containing
                        special characters (such  as  carriage  returns)  when
                        using  XML  requests.  For  more  information, see XML
                        related object key constraints .

                 Filter -> (structure)
                     A filter that identifies the subset of objects  to  which
                     the  replication  rule  applies.  A  Filter  must specify
                     exactly one Prefix , Tag , or an And child element.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        An object key name prefix that identifies  the  subset
                        of objects to which the rule applies.

                        WARNING:
                            Replacement  must be made for object keys contain-
                            ing special characters (such as carriage  returns)
                            when using XML requests. For more information, see
                            XML related object key constraints .

                     Tag -> (structure)
                        A container for specifying a tag key and value.

                        The rule applies only to objects that have the tag  in
                        their tag set.

                        Key -> (string)
                            Name of the object key.

                        Value -> (string)
                            Value of the tag.

                     And -> (structure)
                        A  container  for specifying rule filters. The filters
                        determine the subset of  objects  to  which  the  rule
                        applies.  This element is required only if you specify
                        more than one filter. For example:

                        o If you specify both a Prefix and a Tag filter,  wrap
                          these filters in an And tag.

                        o If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap
                          the Tag elements in an And tag.

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            An object key name prefix that identifies the sub-
                            set of objects to which the rule applies.

                        Tags -> (list)
                            An array of tags containing key and value pairs.

                            (structure)
                               A container of a key value name pair.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   Name of the object key.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   Value of the tag.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the rule is enabled.

                 SourceSelectionCriteria -> (structure)
                     A container that describes additional filters for identi-
                     fying the source objects that you want to replicate.  You
                     can  choose to enable or disable the replication of these
                     objects. Currently, Amazon S3 supports  only  the  filter
                     that you can specify for objects created with server-side
                     encryption using a customer managed key stored in  Amazon
                     Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).

                     SseKmsEncryptedObjects -> (structure)
                        A  container  for filter information for the selection
                        of Amazon S3 objects encrypted with  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                        vices  KMS.  If you include SourceSelectionCriteria in
                        the  replication  configuration,   this   element   is
                        required.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether  Amazon  S3  replicates objects
                            created with server-side encryption using an  Ama-
                            zon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices Key Management Service.

                     ReplicaModifications -> (structure)
                        A filter that you can specify for selections for modi-
                        fications  on  replicas.  Amazon  S3 doesn't replicate
                        replica modifications by default. In the  latest  ver-
                        sion  of  replication  configuration  (when  Filter is
                        specified), you can specify this element and  set  the
                        status to Enabled to replicate modifications on repli-
                        cas.

                        NOTE:
                            If you don't specify the Filter element, Amazon S3
                            assumes  that the replication configuration is the
                            earlier version, V1. In the earlier version,  this
                            element is not allowed

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 replicates modifica-
                            tions on replicas.

                 ExistingObjectReplication -> (structure)
                     Status -> (string)

                 Destination -> (structure)
                     A container for information about the replication  desti-
                     nation  and  its configurations including enabling the S3
                     Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).

                     Bucket -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket where you
                        want Amazon S3 to store the results.

                     Account -> (string)
                        Destination    bucket   owner   account   ID.   In   a
                        cross-account scenario, if you  direct  Amazon  S3  to
                        change  replica  ownership  to the Amazon Web Services
                        account that owns the destination bucket by specifying
                        the  AccessControlTranslation  property,  this  is the
                        account ID of the destination bucket owner.  For  more
                        information, see Replication Additional Configuration:
                        Changing the Replica Owner in the Amazon S3 User Guide
                        .

                     StorageClass -> (string)
                        The  storage  class  to  use when replicating objects,
                        such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default,
                        Amazon  S3 uses the storage class of the source object
                        to create the object replica.

                        For valid values, see the StorageClass element of  the
                        PUT  Bucket  replication  action  in the Amazon S3 API
                        Reference .

                     AccessControlTranslation -> (structure)
                        Specify this only in a cross-account  scenario  (where
                        source  and  destination  bucket  owners  are  not the
                        same), and you want to change replica ownership to the
                        Amazon  Web Services account that owns the destination
                        bucket. If this is not specified  in  the  replication
                        configuration,  the  replicas are owned by same Amazon
                        Web Services account that owns the source object.

                        Owner -> (string)
                            Specifies the replica ownership. For  default  and
                            valid  values,  see  PUT bucket replication in the
                            Amazon S3 API Reference .

                     EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                        A container that provides  information  about  encryp-
                        tion.  If  SourceSelectionCriteria  is  specified, you
                        must specify this element.

                        ReplicaKmsKeyID -> (string)
                            Specifies the ID (Key ARN or  Alias  ARN)  of  the
                            customer  managed  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  key
                            stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management  Ser-
                            vice  (KMS)  for the destination bucket. Amazon S3
                            uses this key to encrypt replica  objects.  Amazon
                            S3  only  supports symmetric, customer managed KMS
                            keys. For more information,  see  Using  symmetric
                            and asymmetric keys in the Amazon Web Services Key

                     ReplicationTime -> (structure)
                        A container specifying S3 Replication Time Control (S3
                        RTC), including whether S3 RTC is enabled and the time
                        when all objects and operations  on  objects  must  be
                        replicated.  Must be specified together with a Metrics
                        block.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies whether the replication time is enabled.

                        Time -> (structure)
                            A  container specifying the time by which replica-
                            tion should be complete for all objects and opera-
                            tions on objects.

                            Minutes -> (integer)
                               Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                               Valid value: 15

                     Metrics -> (structure)
                        A  container  specifying  replication  metrics-related
                        settings enabling replication metrics and events.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether  the  replication  metrics  are
                            enabled.

                        EventThreshold -> (structure)
                            A container  specifying  the  time  threshold  for
                            emitting the s3:Replication:OperationMissedThresh-
                            old event.

                            Minutes -> (integer)
                               Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                 DeleteMarkerReplication -> (structure)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If
                     you specify a Filter in your  replication  configuration,
                     you  must also include a DeleteMarkerReplication element.
                     If your Filter includes a Tag element, the  DeleteMarker-
                     Replication  Status must be set to Disabled, because Ama-
                     zon S3 does not support replicating  delete  markers  for
                     tag-based  rules. For an example configuration, see Basic
                     Rule Configuration .

                     For more information about delete marker replication, see
                     Basic Rule Configuration .

                     NOTE:
                        If you are using an earlier version of the replication
                        configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete
                        markers   differently.   For   more  information,  see
                        Backward Compatibility .

                     Status -> (string)
                        Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

       --token (string)
          A token to allow Object Lock to be enabled for an existing bucket.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To configure replication for an S3 bucket

       The following put-bucket-replication example applies a replication con-
       figuration to the specified S3 bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-replication \
              --bucket AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1 \
              --replication-configuration file://replication.json

       Contents of replication.json:

          {
              "Role": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/s3-replication-role",
              "Rules": [
                  {
                      "Status": "Enabled",
                      "Priority": 1,
                      "DeleteMarkerReplication": { "Status": "Disabled" },
                      "Filter" : { "Prefix": ""},
                      "Destination": {
                          "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET2"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The destination bucket must have versioning enabled. The specified role
       must have permission to write to the  destination  bucket  and  have  a
       trust relationship that allows Amazon S3 to assume the role.

       Example role permission policy:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Action": [
                          "s3:GetReplicationConfiguration",
                          "s3:ListBucket"
                      ],
                      "Resource": [
                          "arn:aws:s3:::AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1"
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Action": [
                          "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                          "s3:GetObjectVersionAcl",
                          "s3:GetObjectVersionTagging"
                      ],
                      "Resource": [
                          "arn:aws:s3:::AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1/*"
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Action": [
                          "s3:ReplicateObject",
                          "s3:ReplicateDelete",
                          "s3:ReplicateTags"
                      ],
                      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET2/*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example trust relationship policy:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {
                          "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
                      },
                      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                  }
              ]
          }

       This command produces no output.
