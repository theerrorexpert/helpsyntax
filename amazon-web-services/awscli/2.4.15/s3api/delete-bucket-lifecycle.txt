DELETE-BUCKET-LIFECYCLE()                            DELETE-BUCKET-LIFECYCLE()



NAME
       delete-bucket-lifecycle -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  lifecycle configuration from the specified bucket. Amazon
       S3 removes all the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle  sub-
       resource  associated  with  the  bucket. Your objects never expire, and
       Amazon S3 no longer automatically deletes any objects on the  basis  of
       rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration.

       To  use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:Put-
       LifecycleConfiguration action. By default, the bucket  owner  has  this
       permission and the bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

       There  is usually some time lag before lifecycle configuration deletion
       is fully propagated to all the Amazon S3 systems.

       For more information about  the  object  expiration,  see  Elements  to
       Describe Lifecycle Actions .

       Related actions include:

       o PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration

       o GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bucket-lifecycle
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name of the lifecycle to delete.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command deletes a lifecycle configuration from a bucket
       named my-bucket:

          aws s3api delete-bucket-lifecycle --bucket my-bucket

OUTPUT
       None
