GET-BUCKET-VERSIONING()                                GET-BUCKET-VERSIONING()



NAME
       get-bucket-versioning -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the versioning state of a bucket.

       To  retrieve  the  versioning state of a bucket, you must be the bucket
       owner.

       This implementation also returns the MFA Delete status of the  version-
       ing  state. If the MFA Delete status is enabled , the bucket owner must
       use an authentication device to change  the  versioning  state  of  the
       bucket.

       The following operations are related to GetBucketVersioning :

       o GetObject

       o PutObject

       o DeleteObject

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-versioning
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name of the bucket for which to get the versioning information.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command retrieves  the  versioning  configuration  for  a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "Status": "Enabled"
          }

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The versioning state of the bucket.

       MFADelete -> (string)
          Specifies  whether  MFA  delete  is enabled in the bucket versioning
          configuration. This element is only returned if the bucket has  been
          configured  with MFA delete. If the bucket has never been so config-
          ured, this element is not returned.
