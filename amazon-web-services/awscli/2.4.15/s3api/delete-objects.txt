DELETE-OBJECTS()                                              DELETE-OBJECTS()



NAME
       delete-objects -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using
       a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys  that  you  want  to
       delete,  then  this  action  provides a suitable alternative to sending
       individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

       The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete.
       In  the  XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version
       IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a  ver-
       sioning-enabled  bucket.  For  each  key,  Amazon  S3 performs a delete
       action and returns the result of that delete, success, or  failure,  in
       the  response.  Note that if the object specified in the request is not
       found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

       The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and  quiet.  By
       default,  the  action  uses verbose mode in which the response includes
       the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet  mode  the
       response  includes  only  keys  where  the delete action encountered an
       error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any infor-
       mation about the delete in the response body.

       When  performing  this  action  on  an  MFA Delete enabled bucket, that
       attempts to delete any versioned  objects,  you  must  include  an  MFA
       token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if
       there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If  you  pro-
       vide  an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request
       or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For  informa-
       tion about MFA Delete, see MFA Delete .

       Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete
       requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that  your  request
       body has not been altered in transit.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-objects
          --bucket <value>
          --delete <value>
          [--mfa <value>]
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--bypass-governance-retention | --no-bypass-governance-retention]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name containing the objects to delete.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --delete (structure)

                     WARNING:
                        Replacement must be made for  object  keys  containing
                        special  characters  (such  as  carriage returns) when
                        using XML requests.  For  more  information,  see  XML
                        related object key constraints .

                     VersionId  for  the  specific  version  of  the object to
                     delete.

          Quiet -> (boolean)
              Element to enable quiet mode for the request. When you add  this
              element, you must set its value to true.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Objects=[{Key=string,VersionId=string},{Key=string,VersionId=string}],Quiet=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Objects": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "VersionId": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "Quiet": true|false
          }

       --mfa (string)
          The  concatenation  of  the authentication device's serial number, a
          space, and the  value  that  is  displayed  on  your  authentication
          device.  Required  to  permanently delete a versioned object if ver-
          sioning is configured with MFA delete enabled.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket  owners  need  not  specify this parameter in their
          requests. For information about downloading objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --bypass-governance-retention    |     --no-bypass-governance-retention
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  you  want to delete this object even if it has a
          Governance-type Object Lock in place. To use this header,  you  must
          have the s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock permission.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command deletes an object from a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api delete-objects --bucket my-bucket --delete file://delete.json

       delete.json  is a JSON document in the current directory that specifies
       the object to delete:

          {
            "Objects": [
              {
                "Key": "test1.txt"
              }
            ],
            "Quiet": false
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Deleted": [
                  {
                      "DeleteMarkerVersionId": "mYAT5Mc6F7aeUL8SS7FAAqUPO1koHwzU",
                      "Key": "test1.txt",
                      "DeleteMarker": true
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Deleted -> (list)
          Container element for a successful delete. It identifies the  object
          that was successfully deleted.

          (structure)
              Information about the deleted object.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the deleted object.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The version ID of the deleted object.

              DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the versioned object that was permanently
                 deleted was (true) or was not (false) a delete marker.  In  a
                 simple  DELETE,  this  header indicates whether (true) or not
                 (false) a delete marker was created.

              DeleteMarkerVersionId -> (string)
                 The version ID of the delete marker created as  a  result  of
                 the  DELETE  operation.  If you delete a specific object ver-
                 sion, the value returned by this header is the version ID  of
                 the object version deleted.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.

       Errors -> (list)
          Container for a failed delete action that describes the object  that
          Amazon S3 attempted to delete and the error it encountered.

          (structure)
              Container for all error elements.

              Key -> (string)
                 The error key.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The version ID of the error.

              Code -> (string)
                 The  error code is a string that uniquely identifies an error
                 condition. It is meant to be read and understood by  programs
                 that detect and handle errors by type.

              Message -> (string)
                 The error message contains a generic description of the error
                 condition  in  English.  It is intended for a human audience.
                 Simple programs display the message directly to the end  user
                 if  they  encounter an error condition they don't know how or
                 don't  care  to  handle.  Sophisticated  programs  with  more
                 exhaustive error handling and proper internationalization are
                 more likely to ignore the error message.
