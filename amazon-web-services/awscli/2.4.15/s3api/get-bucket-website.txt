GET-BUCKET-WEBSITE()                                      GET-BUCKET-WEBSITE()



NAME
       get-bucket-website -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the website configuration for a bucket. To host website on Ama-
       zon S3, you can configure a bucket as website by adding a website  con-
       figuration.  For  more  information about hosting websites, see Hosting
       Websites on Amazon S3 .

       This  GET  action  requires  the  S3:GetBucketWebsite  permission.   By
       default,  only  the bucket owner can read the bucket website configura-
       tion. However, bucket owners can allow other users to read the  website
       configuration  by writing a bucket policy granting them the S3:GetBuck-
       etWebsite permission.

       The following operations are related to DeleteBucketWebsite :

       o DeleteBucketWebsite

       o PutBucketWebsite

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-website
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the website configuration.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command retrieves the static website configuration for  a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-website --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "IndexDocument": {
                  "Suffix": "index.html"
              },
              "ErrorDocument": {
                  "Key": "error.html"
              }
          }

       RedirectAllRequestsTo -> (structure)
          Specifies  the  redirect  behavior of all requests to a website end-
          point of an Amazon S3 bucket.

          HostName -> (string)
              Name of the host where requests are redirected.

          Protocol -> (string)
              Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The  default  is  the

              A suffix that is appended to a request that is for  a  directory
              on the website endpoint (for example,if the suffix is index.html
              and you make a request to samplebucket/images/ the data that  is
              returned   will   be   for   the   object   with  the  key  name
              images/index.html) The suffix must not be  empty  and  must  not

              WARNING:
                 Replacement  must  be made for object keys containing special
                 characters  (such  as  carriage  returns)  when   using   XML

                 constraints .

       ErrorDocument -> (structure)

          class errors.

          Key -> (string)

              WARNING:
                 Replacement  must  be made for object keys containing special
                 characters  (such  as  carriage  returns)  when   using   XML
                 requests.  For  more  information, see XML related object key
                 constraints .

       RoutingRules -> (list)
          Rules that define when a redirect is applied and the redirect behav-
          ior.

          (structure)
              Specifies  the redirect behavior and when a redirect is applied.
              For  more  information  about  routing  rules,  see  Configuring
              advanced conditional redirects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Condition -> (structure)
                 A  container  for describing a condition that must be met for
                 the specified redirect to apply. For example, 1.  If  request
                 is  for pages in the /docs folder, redirect to the /documents
                 folder. 2. If request results in  HTTP  error  4xx,  redirect
                 request to another host where you might process the error.

                 HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals -> (string)
                     The  HTTP error code when the redirect is applied. In the
                     event of an error, if the error code equals  this  value,
                     then  the  specified  redirect  is applied. Required when
                     parent element Condition is specified and sibling KeyPre-
                     fixEquals  is  not specified. If both are specified, then
                     both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

                 KeyPrefixEquals -> (string)
                     The object key name prefix when the redirect is  applied.
                     For  example, to redirect requests for ExamplePage.html ,
                     the key prefix will be  ExamplePage.html  .  To  redirect
                     request  for  all  pages  with the prefix docs/ , the key
                     prefix will be /docs , which identifies  all  objects  in
                     the docs/ folder. Required when the parent element Condi-
                     tion is specified and sibling HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals
                     is  not specified. If both conditions are specified, both
                     must be true for the redirect to be applied.

                        Replacement must be made for  object  keys  containing
                        special  characters  (such  as  carriage returns) when
                        using XML requests.  For  more  information,  see  XML
                        related object key constraints .

              Redirect -> (structure)
                 Container for redirect information. You can redirect requests
                 to another host, to another page, or with  another  protocol.
                 In  the  event of an error, you can specify a different error
                 code to return.

                 HostName -> (string)
                     The host name to use in the redirect request.

                 HttpRedirectCode -> (string)
                     The HTTP redirect  code  to  use  on  the  response.  Not
                     required if one of the siblings is present.

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default is
                     the protocol that is used in the original request.

                 ReplaceKeyPrefixWith -> (string)
                     The object key prefix to use in the redirect request. For
                     example,  to  redirect requests for all pages with prefix
                     docs/ (objects in the docs/ folder) to documents/  ,  you
                     can  set  a  condition  block with KeyPrefixEquals set to
                     docs/ and in the  Redirect  set  ReplaceKeyPrefixWith  to
                     /documents  .  Not  required  if  one  of the siblings is
                     present. Can be present only  if  ReplaceKeyWith  is  not
                     provided.

                     For   example,  redirect  request  to  error.html  .  Not
                     required if one  of  the  siblings  is  present.  Can  be
                     present only if ReplaceKeyPrefixWith is not provided.
