GET-BUCKET-LOGGING()                                      GET-BUCKET-LOGGING()



NAME
       get-bucket-logging -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  logging status of a bucket and the permissions users have
       to view and modify that status. To use GET,  you  must  be  the  bucket
       owner.

       The following operations are related to GetBucketLogging :

       o CreateBucket

       o PutBucketLogging

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-logging
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the logging information.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the logging status for a bucket

       The  following  get-bucket-logging example retrieves the logging status
       for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api get-bucket-logging \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "LoggingEnabled": {
                  "TargetPrefix": "",
                  "TargetBucket": "my-bucket-logs"
                    }
          }

OUTPUT
       LoggingEnabled -> (structure)
          Describes where logs are  stored  and  the  prefix  that  Amazon  S3
          assigns  to  all log object keys for a bucket. For more information,
          see PUT Bucket logging in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

          TargetBucket -> (string)
              Specifies the bucket where you want Amazon S3  to  store  server
              access logs. You can have your logs delivered to any bucket that
              you own, including the same bucket that is being logged. You can
              also  configure  multiple  buckets  to deliver their logs to the
              same target bucket. In this case, you should choose a  different
              TargetPrefix  for  each  source bucket so that the delivered log
              files can be distinguished by key.

          TargetGrants -> (list)
              Container for granting information.

              Buckets that use the bucket owner enforced  setting  for  Object
              Ownership don't support target grants. For more information, see
              Permissions for server access log delivery in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

              (structure)
                 Container for granting information.

                 Buckets that use the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
                 Ownership don't support target grants. For more  information,
                 see  Permissions  server access log delivery in the Amazon S3
                 User Guide .

                 Grantee -> (structure)
                     Container for the person being granted permissions.

                     DisplayName -> (string)
                        Screen name of the grantee.

                     EmailAddress -> (string)
                        Email address of the grantee.

                        NOTE:
                            Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only
                            supported  in  the  following  Amazon Web Services
                            Regions:

                            o US East (N. Virginia)

                            o US West (N. California)

                            o US West (Oregon)

                            o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                            o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                            o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                            o Europe (Ireland)

                            o South America (So Paulo)

                            For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported  Regions
                            and  endpoints,  see  Regions and Endpoints in the
                            Amazon Web Services General Reference.

                     ID -> (string)
                        The canonical user ID of the grantee.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Type of grantee

                     URI -> (string)

                     bucket.

          TargetPrefix -> (string)
              A  prefix  for  all log object keys. If you store log files from
              multiple Amazon S3 buckets in a single bucket,  you  can  use  a
              prefix to distinguish which log files came from which bucket.
