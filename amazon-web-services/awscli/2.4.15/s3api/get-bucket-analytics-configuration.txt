NAME
       get-bucket-analytics-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       This  implementation  of the GET action returns an analytics configura-
       tion (identified by the analytics configuration ID) from the bucket.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Get-
       AnalyticsConfiguration  action. The bucket owner has this permission by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions  to  Your  Amazon  S3
       Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       For  information  about Amazon S3 analytics feature, see Amazon S3 Ana-
       lytics  Storage Class Analysis in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-analytics-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --id <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket from  which  an  analytics  configuration  is
          retrieved.

       --id (string)
          The ID that identifies the analytics configuration.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the analytics configuration for a bucket with a specific ID

       The following get-bucket-analytics-configuration example  displays  the
       analytics configuration for the specified bucket and ID.

          aws s3api get-bucket-analytics-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --id 1

       Output:

          {
              "AnalyticsConfiguration": {
                  "StorageClassAnalysis": {},
                  "Id": "1"
              }
          }

          Filter -> (structure)
              The  filter  used  to  describe a set of objects for analyses. A
              filter must have exactly one prefix, one tag, or one conjunction
              (AnalyticsAndOperator).  If  no  filter is provided, all objects
              will be considered in any analysis.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix to use when evaluating an analytics filter.

              Tag -> (structure)
                 The tag to use when evaluating an analytics filter.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

              And -> (structure)
                 A conjunction (logical AND) of predicates, which is  used  in
                 evaluating  an  analytics  filter.  The operator must have at
                 least two predicates.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix to use when evaluating an AND  predicate:  The

                     metrics results.

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The list of tags to use when evaluating an AND predicate.

                     (structure)
                        A container of a key value name pair.

                 Specifies  how data related to the storage class analysis for
                 an Amazon S3 bucket should be exported.

                 OutputSchemaVersion -> (string)
                     The version of the output schema to  use  when  exporting
                     data. Must be V_1 .

                            NOTE:
                               Although this value is  optional,  we  strongly
                               recommend that you set it to help prevent prob-
                               lems  if  the  destination   bucket   ownership
                               changes.
