DELETE-OBJECT()                                                DELETE-OBJECT()



NAME
       delete-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the  null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a
       delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there
       isn't  a  null  version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will
       still respond that the command was successful.

       To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must
       use  the  version  Id  subresource.  Using this subresource permanently
       deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete  marker,  Amazon
       S3 sets the response header, x-amz-delete-marker , to true.

       If  the  object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket ver-
       sioning configuration is MFA  Delete  enabled,  you  must  include  the
       x-amz-mfa request header in the DELETE versionId request. Requests that
       include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS.

       For more information about MFA Delete, see Using MFA Delete  .  To  see
       sample requests that use versioning, see Sample Request .

       You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure
       its lifecycle (PutBucketLifecycle ) to enable Amazon S3 to remove  them
       for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or delet-
       ing objects from your bucket, you must deny them the s3:DeleteObject  ,
       s3:DeleteObjectVersion , and s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration actions.

       The following action is related to DeleteObject :

       o PutObject

SYNOPSIS
            delete-object
          --bucket <value>
          --key <value>
          [--mfa <value>]
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--bypass-governance-retention | --no-bypass-governance-retention]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name of the bucket containing the object.

          When  using  this  action  with  an  access  point,  you must direct
          requests to the access point hostname.  The  access  point  hostname
          takes  the  form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region*
          .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point  through
          the  Amazon  Web  Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in
          place of the bucket name. For more information  about  access  point
          ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --key (string)
          Key name of the object to delete.

       --mfa (string)
          The concatenation of the authentication device's  serial  number,  a
          space,  and  the  value  that  is  displayed  on your authentication
          device. Required to permanently delete a versioned  object  if  ver-
          sioning is configured with MFA delete enabled.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not  specify  this  parameter  in  their
          requests.  For  information about downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --bypass-governance-retention     |    --no-bypass-governance-retention
       (boolean)
          Indicates whether  S3  Object  Lock  should  bypass  Governance-mode
          restrictions to process this operation. To use this header, you must
          have the s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock permission.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a  different  account,  the  request  will fail with an HTTP 403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command deletes an object named test.txt  from  a  bucket
       named my-bucket:

          aws s3api delete-object --bucket my-bucket --key test.txt

       If bucket versioning is enabled, the output will contain the version ID
       of the delete marker:

          {
            "VersionId": "9_gKg5vG56F.TTEUdwkxGpJ3tNDlWlGq",
            "DeleteMarker": true
          }

       For more information about deleting objects, see  Deleting  Objects  in
       the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether the versioned object that was permanently deleted
          was (true) or was not (false) a delete marker.

       VersionId -> (string)
          Returns the version ID of the delete marker created as a  result  of
          the DELETE operation.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.
