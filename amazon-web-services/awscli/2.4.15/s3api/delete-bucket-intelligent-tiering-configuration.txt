DELETE-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIEDELETE-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIERING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       delete-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  configuration from the specified
       bucket.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize  stor-
       age costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective stor-
       age access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3
       Intelligent-Tiering  delivers  automatic  cost  savings  in  three  low
       latency and high throughput access tiers. To  get  the  lowest  storage
       cost  on  data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose
       to activate additional archiving capabilities.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for
       data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, indepen-
       dent of object size or retention period. If the size of  an  object  is
       less  than  128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tier-
       ing. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at  the
       Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

       For more information, see Storage class  for  automatically  optimizing
       frequently and infrequently accessed objects .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose  configuration  you  want  to
          modify or retrieve.

       --id (string)
          The ID used to identify the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
