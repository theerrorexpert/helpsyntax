NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an inventory configuration (identified by the inventory config-
       uration ID) from the bucket.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Get-
       InventoryConfiguration  action. The bucket owner has this permission by
       default and can grant this permission to others. For  more  information
       about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Opera-
       tions and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       For information about the Amazon S3 inventory feature,  see  Amazon  S3
       Inventory .

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-inventory-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --id <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing  the  inventory  configuration  to
          retrieve.

       --id (string)
          The ID used to identify the inventory configuration.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the inventory configuration for a bucket

       The  following get-bucket-inventory-configuration example retrieves the
       inventory configuration for the specified bucket with ID 1.

          aws s3api get-bucket-inventory-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --id 1
