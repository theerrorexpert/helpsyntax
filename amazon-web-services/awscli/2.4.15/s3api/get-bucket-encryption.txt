GET-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()                                GET-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       get-bucket-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  default encryption configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.
       If the bucket does not have a default  encryption  configuration,  Get-
       BucketEncryption returns ServerSideEncryptionConfigurationNotFoundError
       .

       For information about the Amazon S3  default  encryption  feature,  see
       Amazon S3 Default Bucket Encryption .

       To  use  this  operation,  you  must  have  permission  to  perform the
       s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permis-
       sion  by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.
       For more information about  permissions,  see  Permissions  Related  to
       Bucket  Subresource  Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your
       Amazon S3 Resources .

       The following operations are related to GetBucketEncryption :

       o PutBucketEncryption

       o DeleteBucketEncryption

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-encryption
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket from which the server-side encryption config-
          uration is retrieved.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request  will  fail  with  an  HTTP  403
          (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the server-side encryption configuration for a bucket

       The  following  get-bucket-encryption example retrieves the server-side
       encryption configuration for the bucket my-bucket.

          aws s3api get-bucket-encryption \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": {
                  "Rules": [
                      {
                          "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                              "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
                          }
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
          Specifies the default server-side-encryption configuration.

          Rules -> (list)
              Container for information about a particular server-side encryp-
              tion configuration rule.

              (structure)
                 Specifies the default server-side encryption configuration.

                 ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the default server-side encryption to apply to
                     new objects in  the  bucket.  If  a  PUT  Object  request
                     doesn't  specify any server-side encryption, this default
                     encryption will be applied.

                     SSEAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Server-side  encryption  algorithm  to  use  for   the
                        default encryption.

                     KMSMasterKeyID -> (string)
                        Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) cus-
                        tomer Amazon Web Services KMS key ID to  use  for  the
                        default  encryption.  This parameter is allowed if and
                        only if SSEAlgorithm is set to aws:kms .

                        You can specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name
                        (ARN)  of  the  KMS  key.  However,  if  you are using
                        encryption with cross-account or Amazon  Web  Services
                        service  operations you must use a fully qualified KMS
                        key ARN. For more information,  see  Using  encryption
                        for cross-account operations .
                            For example:

                        o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        o Key                                             ARN:
                          arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        WARNING:
                            Amazon S3 only supports symmetric KMS keys and not
                            asymmetric KMS keys.  For  more  information,  see
                            Using  symmetric and asymmetric keys in the Amazon
                            Web  Services  Key  Management  Service  Developer
                            Guide .

                 BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key
                     with server-side encryption using KMS (SSE-KMS)  for  new
                     objects in the bucket. Existing objects are not affected.
                     Setting the BucketKeyEnabled element to true causes  Ama-
                     zon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key. By default, S3 Bucket Key
                     is not enabled.
