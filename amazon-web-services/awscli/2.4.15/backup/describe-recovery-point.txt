       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-recovery-point
          --backup-vault-name <value>
          --recovery-point-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Amazon Web Services  Region  where  they  are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery
          point;  for  example,   arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  recovery point; for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them and the Region where they are created. They consist
          of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  backup  vault;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       SourceBackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the source
          vault where the resource was originally backed up in;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:BackupVault   .  If  the
          recovery is restored to the same  Amazon  Web  Services  account  or
          Region, this value will be null .

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          An  ARN that uniquely identifies a saved resource. The format of the
          ARN depends on the resource type.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The type of Amazon Web Services  resource  to  save  as  a  recovery
          point;  for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) vol-
          ume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)  database.

       CreatedBy -> (structure)
          Contains  identifying  information  about the creation of a recovery
          point, including the BackupPlanArn , BackupPlanId  ,  BackupPlanVer-
          sion , and BackupRuleId of the backup plan used to create it.

          BackupPlanId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

          BackupPlanArn -> (string)
              An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup
              plan;                        for                        example,
              arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
              .

          BackupPlanVersion -> (string)
              Version IDs  are  unique,  randomly  generated,  Unicode,  UTF-8
              encoded  strings  that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot
              be edited.

          BackupRuleId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a rule used to  schedule  the  backup  of  a
              selection of resources.

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       Status -> (string)
          A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.
              PARTIAL status indicates Backup could not  create  the  recovery
              point  before  the backup window closed. To increase your backup
              plan window using the API, see UpdateBackupPlan . You  can  also
              increase  your  backup plan window using the Console by choosing
              and editing your backup plan.

              EXPIRED status indicates that the recovery  point  has  exceeded
              its  retention  period, but Backup lacks permission or is other-
              wise unable to delete it.  To  manually  delete  these  recovery
              points,  see  Step 3: Delete the recovery points in the Clean up
              resources section of Getting started .

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          A status message explaining the reason for the recovery point  dele-
          tion failure.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time that a recovery point is created, in Unix format
          and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  CreationDate  is
          accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 rep-
          resents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a job to create  a  recovery  point  is  com-
          pleted,  in  Unix  format  and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The
          value of CompletionDate is accurate to  milliseconds.  For  example,
          the   value  1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,  2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

       BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The size, in bytes, of a backup.

       CalculatedLifecycle -> (structure)
          A CalculatedLifecycle object containing DeleteAt and MoveToColdStor-
          ageAt timestamps.

          MoveToColdStorageAt -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp  that specifies when to transition a recovery point
              to cold storage.

          DeleteAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.

       Lifecycle -> (structure)
          The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is  transitioned  to
          cold  storage  and  when  it expires. Backup transitions and expires
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups that are transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold
          storage  for  a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the expire after days
          setting must be 90 days greater than the transition  to  cold  after
          days  setting.  The  transition to cold after days setting cannot be
          changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Only Amazon EFS file system backups  can  be  transitioned  to  cold
          storage.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
          The server-side encryption key used to  protect  your  backups;  for
          example,
          arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
          .

       IsEncrypted -> (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value that is returned as TRUE if the specified recovery
          point is encrypted, or FALSE if the recovery point is not encrypted.

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Specifies  the storage class of the recovery point. Valid values are
          WARM or COLD .

       LastRestoreTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a recovery point was last restored,  in  Unix
          format  and  Coordinated  Universal Time (UTC). The value of LastRe-
          storeTime is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the  value
          1516925490.087  represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
