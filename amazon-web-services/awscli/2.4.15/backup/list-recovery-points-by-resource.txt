NAME
       list-recovery-points-by-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed information about all the recovery points of the type
       specified by a resource Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       NOTE:
          For Amazon EFS and Amazon  EC2,  this  action  only  lists  recovery
          points created by Backup.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-recovery-points-by-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN
          depends on the resource type.

       --next-token (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be returned.

          NOTE:
              Amazon RDS requires a value of at least 20.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       RecoveryPoints -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain detailed information about recovery
          points of the specified resource type.

          NOTE:
              Only  Amazon  EFS  and Amazon EC2 recovery points return Backup-
              VaultName.

          (structure)
              Contains detailed information about a saved recovery point.

              RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  that  uniquely  identifies  a
                 recovery            point;            for            example,
                 arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
                 ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a recovery point is created, in Unix format
                 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Creation-
                 Date  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the value
                 1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,    2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              Status -> (string)
                 A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A  message  explaining the reason of the recovery point dele-
                 tion failure.

              EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
                 The server-side encryption key that is used to  protect  your
                 backups;                     for                     example,
                 arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                 .

              BackupSizeBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of a backup.

              BackupVaultName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored.
                 Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to  the
                 account  used  to  create  them  and  the Amazon Web Services
                 Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase let-
                 ters, numbers, and hyphens.
