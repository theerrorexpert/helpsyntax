NAME
       describe-report-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details associated with creating a report as specified by
       its ReportJobId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-report-job
          --report-job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --report-job-id (string)
          The identifier of the report job. A unique, randomly generated, Uni-
          code,  UTF-8  encoded  string  that is at most 1,024 bytes long. The
          report job ID cannot be edited.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ReportJob -> (structure)
          A list of information about a report job, including  its  completion
          and creation times, report destination, unique report job ID, Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN), report template, status, and status message.

          ReportJobId -> (string)
              The identifier for a report job. A unique,  randomly  generated,
              Unicode,  UTF-8 encoded string that is at most 1,024 bytes long.
              Report job IDs cannot be edited.

          ReportPlanArn -> (string)
              An  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that  uniquely  identifies  a

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time that a report job is created, in Unix format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  CreationTime
              is   accurate   to   milliseconds.   For   example,   the  value
              1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018  12:11:30.087

          CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that a report job is completed, in Unix format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value  of  Completion-

              S3BucketName -> (string)
                 The unique name of the Amazon S3 bucket  that  receives  your
