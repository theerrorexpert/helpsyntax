NAME
       update-recovery-point-lifecycle -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the transition lifecycle of a recovery point.

       The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold
       storage and when it expires. Backup  transitions  and  expires  backups
       automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

       Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for
       a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the expire after days setting must  be
       90  days  greater  than  the transition to cold after days setting. The
       transition to cold after days setting cannot be changed after a  backup
       has been transitioned to cold.

       Only  Amazon  EFS file system backups can be transitioned to cold stor-
       age.

       Does not support continuous backups.

SYNOPSIS
            update-recovery-point-lifecycle
          --backup-vault-name <value>
          --recovery-point-arn <value>
          [--lifecycle <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Amazon Web Services  Region  where  they  are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery
          point;  for  example,   arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       --lifecycle (structure)
          The  lifecycle  defines when a protected resource is transitioned to
          cold storage and when it expires.  Backup  transitions  and  expires
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups  transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage
          for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the expire after  days  setting
          must  be 90 days greater than the transition to cold after days set-
          ting. The transition to cold after days setting  cannot  be  changed
          after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays=long,DeleteAfterDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MoveToColdStorageAfterDays": long,
            "DeleteAfterDays": long
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  backup  vault;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery
          point;  for  example,   arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       Lifecycle -> (structure)
          The  lifecycle  defines when a protected resource is transitioned to
          cold storage and when it expires.  Backup  transitions  and  expires
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups  transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage
          for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the expire after  days  setting
          must  be 90 days greater than the transition to cold after days set-
          ting. The transition to cold after days setting  cannot  be  changed
          after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Only  Amazon  EFS  file  system  backups can be transitioned to cold
          storage.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus  MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       CalculatedLifecycle -> (structure)
          A CalculatedLifecycle object containing DeleteAt and MoveToColdStor-
          ageAt timestamps.

          MoveToColdStorageAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that specifies when to transition a  recovery  point
              to cold storage.

          DeleteAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.
