            start-copy-job
          --recovery-point-arn <value>

          --destination-backup-vault-arn <value>
          --iam-role-arn <value>
          [--idempotency-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point to use for the copy
          job;   for   example,   arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45.

       --source-backup-vault-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical source container where backups are stored.
          Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account
          used  to  create  them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they
          are  created.  They  consist  of  lowercase  letters,  numbers,  and
          hyphens.

       --destination-backup-vault-arn (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a destination
          backup      vault      to      copy      to;      for       example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  IAM role ARN used to copy the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A customer-chosen string that you can  use  to  distinguish  between
          otherwise  identical  calls  to StartCopyJob . Retrying a successful
          request with the same idempotency token results in a success message
          with no action taken.

       --lifecycle (structure)
          Contains  an array of Transition objects specifying how long in days
          before a recovery point transitions to cold storage or is deleted.

          Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold  storage
          for  a  minimum  of  90  days. Therefore, on the console, the expire
          after days setting must be 90 days greater than  the  transition  to
          cold  after  days setting. The transition to cold after days setting
          cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Only Amazon EFS file system backups  can  be  transitioned  to  cold
          storage.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays=long,DeleteAfterDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MoveToColdStorageAfterDays": long,
            "DeleteAfterDays": long
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CopyJobId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies a copy job.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a copy job is created,  in  Unix  format  and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is accu-
          rate to milliseconds. For example, the value  1516925490.087  repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
