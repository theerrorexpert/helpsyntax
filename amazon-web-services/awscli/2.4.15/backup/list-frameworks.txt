LIST-FRAMEWORKS()                                            LIST-FRAMEWORKS()



NAME
       list-frameworks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all frameworks for an Amazon Web Services account and
       Amazon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-frameworks
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The number of desired results from 1 to 1000. Optional. If  unspeci-
          fied, the query will return 1 MB of data.

       --next-token (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
          list.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Frameworks -> (list)
          A  list of frameworks with details for each framework, including the
          framework name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), description,  number  of
          controls, creation time, and deployment status.

          (structure)
              Contains detailed information about a framework. Frameworks con-
              tain controls, which evaluate and report on your  backup  events
              and resources. Frameworks generate daily compliance results.

              FrameworkName -> (string)
                 The  unique  name  of a framework. This name is between 1 and
                 256 characters, starting with a  letter,  and  consisting  of
                 letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).

              FrameworkArn -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that uniquely identifies a
                 resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

              FrameworkDescription -> (string)
                 An optional description of the framework with a maximum 1,024
                 characters.

              NumberOfControls -> (integer)
                 The number of controls contained by the framework.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that a framework is created, in Unix format
                 and  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of Creation-
                 Time is accurate to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the  value
                 1516925490.087    represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              DeploymentStatus -> (string)
                 The deployment status of a framework. The statuses are:
                     CREATE_IN_PROGRESS      |      UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS       |
                     DELETE_IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | FAILED

       NextToken -> (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
          list.
