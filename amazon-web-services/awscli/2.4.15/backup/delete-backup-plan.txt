DELETE-BACKUP-PLAN()                                      DELETE-BACKUP-PLAN()



NAME
       delete-backup-plan -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  backup  plan.  A  backup plan can only be deleted after all
       associated selections of resources have been deleted. Deleting a backup
       plan  deletes  the current version of a backup plan. Previous versions,
       if any, will still exist.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-backup-plan
          --backup-plan-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BackupPlanId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       BackupPlanArn -> (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  uniquely  identifies  a  backup
          plan;                          for                          example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
          .

       DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time a backup plan is deleted, in Unix format and Coor-
          dinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of DeletionDate is  accurate
          to  milliseconds.  For  example, the value 1516925490.087 represents
          Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       VersionId -> (string)
