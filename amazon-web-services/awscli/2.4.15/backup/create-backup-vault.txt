SYNOPSIS
            create-backup-vault
          --backup-vault-name <value>
          [--backup-vault-tags <value>]
          [--encryption-key-arn <value>]
          [--creator-request-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Amazon Web Services  Region  where  they  are
          created. They consist of letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --backup-vault-tags (map)
          Metadata that you can assign to help organize the resources that you
          create. Each tag is a key-value pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --encryption-key-arn (string)
          The server-side encryption key that is used to protect your backups;
          for                                                         example,
          arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
          .

       --creator-request-id (string)
          A  unique  string  that  identifies  the  request  and allows failed
          requests to be retried without the risk  of  running  the  operation
          twice. This parameter is optional.

          If  used,  this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.'
          characters.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a backup vault

       The following create-backup-vault example creates a backup  vault  with
       the specified name.

          aws backup create-backup-vault
              --backup-vault-name sample-vault

       This command produces no output.  Output:

          {
              "BackupVaultName": "sample-vault",
              "BackupVaultArn": "arn:aws:backup:us-west-2:123456789012:backup-vault:sample-vault",
              "CreationDate": 1568928338.385
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Region where they are created.  They  consist
          of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that uniquely identifies a backup
          vault;                         for                          example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  a  backup vault is created, in Unix format and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is accu-
          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
