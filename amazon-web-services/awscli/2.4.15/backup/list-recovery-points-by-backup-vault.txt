SYNOPSIS
            list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault
          --backup-vault-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--by-resource-arn <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Amazon Web Services  Region  where  they  are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

          NOTE:
              Backup  vault  name might not be available when a supported ser-
              vice creates the backup.

       --next-token (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be returned.

       --by-resource-arn (string)
          Returns  only recovery points that match the specified resource Ama-
          zon Resource Name (ARN).

       --by-resource-type (string)
          Returns only recovery points that match the specified resource type.

       --by-backup-plan-id (string)
          Returns  only  recovery  points that match the specified backup plan
          ID.

       --by-created-before (timestamp)
          Returns only recovery points that were created before the  specified
          timestamp.

       --by-created-after (timestamp)
          Returns  only  recovery points that were created after the specified
          timestamp.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

                 recovery  point, including the BackupPlanArn , BackupPlanId ,
                 BackupPlanVersion , and BackupRuleId of the backup plan  that
                 is used to create it.

                     backup           plan;            for            example,
                     arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50

                 A  message  explaining the reason of the recovery point dele-
                 tion failure.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a recovery point is created, in Unix format
                 and  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of Creation-
                 Date is accurate to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the  value
                 1516925490.087    represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a job to restore a recovery point  is  com-
                 pleted,  in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
                 The value of CompletionDate is accurate to milliseconds.  For
                 example,  the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January
                 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of a backup.

              CalculatedLifecycle -> (structure)
                 A CalculatedLifecycle object containing DeleteAt and  MoveTo-
                 ColdStorageAt timestamps.

                 MoveToColdStorageAt -> (timestamp)
                     A  timestamp that specifies when to transition a recovery
                     point to cold storage.

                 DeleteAt -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp that specifies  when  to  delete  a  recovery
                     point.

              Lifecycle -> (structure)
                 The  lifecycle  defines  when a protected resource is transi-
                 tioned to cold storage and when it  expires.  Backup  transi-
                 tions  and  expires  backups  automatically  according to the
                 lifecycle that you define.

                 Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored  in  cold
                 storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the expire after
                 days setting must be 90 days greater than the  transition  to
                 cold  after  days  setting. The transition to cold after days
                 setting cannot be changed after a  backup  has  been  transi-
                 tioned to cold.

                 Only  Amazon  EFS  file system backups can be transitioned to
                 cold storage.

                 MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                     Specifies the number of days after creation that a recov-
                     ery point is moved to cold storage.

                 DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                     Specifies the number of days after creation that a recov-
                     ery point is deleted. Must be greater than 90  days  plus
                     MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

              EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
                 The  server-side  encryption key that is used to protect your
                 backups;                     for                     example,
                 arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                 .

              IsEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value that is returned as  TRUE  if  the  specified
                 recovery  point  is encrypted, or FALSE if the recovery point
                 is not encrypted.

              LastRestoreTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a recovery point was last restored, in Unix
                 format  and  Coordinated  Universal  Time (UTC). The value of
                 LastRestoreTime is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the
                 value  1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26, 2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.
