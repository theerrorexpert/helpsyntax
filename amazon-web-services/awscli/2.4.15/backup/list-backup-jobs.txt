            list-backup-jobs
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--by-resource-arn <value>]
          [--by-state <value>]
          [--by-backup-vault-name <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be returned.

       --by-resource-arn (string)
          Returns only backup jobs that match the  specified  resource  Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN).

       --by-state (string)
          Returns only backup jobs that are in the specified state.

          Possible values:

          o CREATED

          o PENDING

          o RUNNING

          o ABORTING

          o ABORTED

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o EXPIRED

       --by-backup-vault-name (string)
          Returns only backup jobs that will be stored in the specified backup
          vault. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to  the
          account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where
          they are created. They consist of lowercase  letters,  numbers,  and
          hyphens.

       --by-created-before (timestamp)
          Returns  only  backup  jobs  that  were created before the specified
          date.

       --by-created-after (timestamp)
          Returns only backup jobs that were created after the specified date.

       --by-resource-type (string)
          Returns only backup jobs for the specified resources:

          o DynamoDB for Amazon DynamoDB

          o EBS for Amazon Elastic Block Store

          o EC2 for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

          o EFS for Amazon Elastic File System

          o RDS for Amazon Relational Database Service

          o Aurora for Amazon Aurora

          o Storage Gateway for Storage Gateway

       --by-account-id (string)
          The account ID to list the jobs from. Returns only backup jobs asso-
          ciated with the specified account ID.

          If used from an Organizations management account, passing *  returns
          all jobs across the organization.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a backup job is created, in Unix format and
                 Coordinated  Universal  Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate
                 is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For   example,   the   value

                 names without  those  strings  lack  permissions  to  perform
                 backup jobs.

              CreatedBy -> (structure)
                 Contains  identifying  information  about  the  creation of a
                 backup job, including  the  BackupPlanArn  ,  BackupPlanId  ,
                 BackupPlanVersion  , and BackupRuleId of the backup plan used
                 to create it.

                 BackupPlanId -> (string)
                     Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

                 BackupPlanArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies  a
                     backup            plan;            for           example,
                     arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
                     .

                 BackupPlanVersion -> (string)
                     Version  IDs  are  unique,  randomly  generated, Unicode,
                     UTF-8 encoded strings that are at most 1,024 bytes  long.
                     They cannot be edited.

                 BackupRuleId -> (string)
                     Uniquely identifies a rule used to schedule the backup of
                     a selection of resources.

              ExpectedCompletionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a job to back up resources is  expected  to
                 be  completed,  in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time
                 (UTC). The value of  ExpectedCompletionDate  is  accurate  to
                 milliseconds.  For  example,  the value 1516925490.087 repre-
                 sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              StartBy -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the time in Unix format and  Coordinated  Universal
                 Time  (UTC)  when  a  backup job must be started before it is
                 canceled. The value is calculated by adding the start  window
                 to  the scheduled time. So if the scheduled time were 6:00 PM
                 and the start window is 2 hours, the StartBy  time  would  be
                 8:00  PM on the date specified. The value of StartBy is accu-
                 rate to milliseconds. For example, the  value  1516925490.087
                 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services resource to be backed up; for
                 example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or
                 an  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.
                 For Windows Volume Shadow Copy  Service  (VSS)  backups,  the
                 only supported resource type is Amazon EC2.

              BytesTransferred -> (long)
                 The  size  in bytes transferred to a backup vault at the time
                 that the job status was queried.

              BackupOptions -> (map)
                 Specifies the backup option for  a  selected  resource.  This
                 option  is only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Ser-
                 vice (VSS) backup jobs.

                 Valid values: Set to  "WindowsVSS":"enabled"  to  enable  the
                 WindowsVSS backup option and create a Windows VSS backup. Set
                 to "WindowsVSS":"disabled" to create a regular backup. If you
                 specify  an invalid option, you get an InvalidParameterValue-
                 Exception exception.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              BackupType -> (string)
                 Represents the type of backup for a backup job.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.
