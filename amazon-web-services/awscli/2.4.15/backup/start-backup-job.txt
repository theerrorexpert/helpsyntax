OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them  and  the Amazon Web Services Region where they are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --resource-arn (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies  a  resource.
          The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A customer-chosen string that you can  use  to  distinguish  between
          otherwise  identical calls to StartBackupJob . Retrying a successful
          request with the same idempotency token results in a success message
          with no action taken.

       --start-window-minutes (long)
          A  value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be
          canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value  is  optional,
          and the default is 8 hours.

       --complete-window-minutes (long)
          A  value  in minutes during which a successfully started backup must
          complete, or else AWS Backup will cancel  the  job.  This  value  is
          optional.  This  value begins counting down from when the backup was
          scheduled. It does not add additional time for StartWindowMinutes  ,
          or if the backup started later than scheduled.

       --lifecycle (structure)
          The  lifecycle  defines when a protected resource is transitioned to
          cold storage and when it expires. Backup will transition and  expire
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups  transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage
          for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the expire after  days  setting
          must  be 90 days greater than the transition to cold after days set-
          ting. The transition to cold after days setting  cannot  be  changed
          after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Only  Amazon  EFS  file  system  backups can be transitioned to cold
          storage.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus  MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays=long,DeleteAfterDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MoveToColdStorageAfterDays": long,
            "DeleteAfterDays": long
          }

       --recovery-point-tags (map)
          To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to
          the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --backup-options (map)
          Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This option  is
          only  available  for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup
          jobs.

          Valid values: Set to "WindowsVSS":"enabled" to enable the WindowsVSS
          backup  option  and  create  a  Windows  VSS  backup.  Set  to "Win-
          dowsVSS""disabled" to create a regular backup. The WindowsVSS option
          is not enabled by default.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BackupJobId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies a request to Backup to back up a resource.

       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  recovery point; for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time that a backup job is created, in Unix format and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is accu-
          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
