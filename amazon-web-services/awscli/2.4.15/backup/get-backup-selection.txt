GET-BACKUP-SELECTION()                                  GET-BACKUP-SELECTION()



NAME
       get-backup-selection -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns selection metadata and a document in JSON format that specifies
       a list of resources that are associated with a backup plan.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-backup-selection
          --backup-plan-id <value>
          --selection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --selection-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies the body  of  a  request  to  assign  a  set  of
          resources to a backup plan.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BackupSelection -> (structure)
          Specifies  the  body  of a request to assign a set of resources to a
          backup plan.

          SelectionName -> (string)
              The display name of a resource selection document. Must  contain
              1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the IAM role that Backup uses to authenticate when
              backing    up    the    target    resource;     for     example,
              arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

          Resources -> (list)
              A  list  of  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) to assign to a backup
              plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30
              ARNs with wildcards.

              If  you need to assign many resources to a backup plan, consider
              a different resource selection strategy, such as  assigning  all
              resources of a resource type or refining your resource selection
              using tags.

              (string)

          ListOfTags -> (list)
              A list of conditions that you define to assign resources to your
              backup  plans using tags. For example, "StringEquals": {"Depart-
              ment": "accounting" . Condition operators are case sensitive.
                 ListOfTags differs from Conditions as follows:

              o When you specify more  than  one  condition,  you  assign  all
                resources  that match AT LEAST ONE condition (using OR logic).

              o ListOfTags only supports StringEquals  .  Conditions  supports
                StringEquals  ,  StringLike , StringNotEquals , and StringNot-
                Like .

              (structure)
                 Contains an array of triplets made up  of  a  condition  type
                 (such  as  StringEquals ), a key, and a value. Used to filter
                 resources using their tags and assign them to a backup  plan.
                 Case sensitive.

                 ConditionType -> (string)
                     An  operation  applied to a key-value pair used to assign
                     resources to your backup plan.  Condition  only  supports
                     StringEquals  .  For  more  flexible  assignment options,
                     incluidng StringLike and the ability to exclude resources
                     from your backup plan, use Conditions (with an "s" on the
                     end)       for       your        `        BackupSelection
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_BackupSelection.html`__
                     .

                 ConditionKey -> (string)
                     The key in a key-value pair.  For  example,  in  the  tag
                     Department: Accounting , Department is the key.

                 ConditionValue -> (string)
                     The  value  in  a key-value pair. For example, in the tag
                     Department: Accounting , Accounting is the value.

          NotResources -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to exclude from a  backup
              plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30
              ARNs with wildcards.

              If you need to exclude many resources from a backup  plan,  con-
              sider a different resource selection strategy, such as assigning
              only one or a few  resource  types  or  refining  your  resource
              selection using tags.

              (string)

          Conditions -> (structure)
              A list of conditions that you define to assign resources to your
              backup plans using tags. For example, "StringEquals":  {"Depart-
              ment": "accounting" . Condition operators are case sensitive.
                 Conditions differs from ListOfTags as follows:

              o When  you specify more than one condition, you only assign the
                resources that match ALL conditions (using AND logic).

              o Conditions supports StringEquals ,  StringLike  ,  StringNotE-
                quals  , and StringNotLike . ListOfTags only supports StringE-
                quals .

              StringEquals -> (list)
                 Filters the values of your tagged resources  for  only  those
                 resources  that  you  tagged with the same value. Also called
                 "exact matching."

                 (structure)
                     Includes information about  tags  you  define  to  assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     ConditionValue -> (string)
                        The value in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag
                        Department: Accounting , Accounting is the value.

              StringNotEquals -> (list)
                 Filters  the  values  of your tagged resources for only those
                 resources that you tagged that do not have  the  same  value.
                 Also called "negated matching."

                 (structure)
                     Includes  information  about  tags  you  define to assign

                        The key in a key-value pair. For example, in  the  tag

              StringLike -> (list)
                 Filters the values of your tagged resources for matching  tag
                 values  with  the use of a wildcard character (*) anywhere in
                 the string. For example, "prod*" or  "rod"  matches  the  tag
                 value "production".

                 (structure)
                     Includes  information  about  tags  you  define to assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The key in a key-value pair. For example, in  the  tag

                 tag  values with the use of a wildcard character (*) anywhere
                 in the string.

                 (structure)

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The  key  in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag
