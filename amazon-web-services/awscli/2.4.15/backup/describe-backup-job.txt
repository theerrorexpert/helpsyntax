NAME
       describe-backup-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns backup job details for the specified BackupJobId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-backup-job
          --backup-job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-job-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a request to Backup to back up a resource.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccountId -> (string)
          Returns the account ID that owns the backup job.

       BackupJobId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies a request to Backup to back up a resource.

       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them  and  the Amazon Web Services Region where they are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  uniquely  identifies  a  backup
          vault;                          for                         example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An ARN that uniquely  identifies  a  recovery  point;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          An ARN that uniquely identifies a saved resource. The format of  the
          ARN depends on the resource type.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time that a backup job is created, in Unix format and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is accu-
          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a job to create a backup job is completed, in
          Unix  format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of Com-
          pletionDate is accurate to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the  value
          1516925490.087  represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       State -> (string)
          The current state of a resource recovery point.

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          A detailed message explaining the status of the job  to  back  up  a
          resource.

       PercentDone -> (string)
          Contains  an  estimated  percentage that is complete of a job at the
          time the job status was queried.

       BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The size, in bytes, of a backup.

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       CreatedBy -> (structure)
          Contains identifying information about the creation of a backup job,
          including the BackupPlanArn , BackupPlanId , BackupPlanVersion , and
          BackupRuleId of the backup plan that is used to create it.

          BackupPlanId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

          BackupPlanArn -> (string)
              An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup
              plan;                        for                        example,
              arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
              .

          BackupPlanVersion -> (string)
              Version IDs  are  unique,  randomly  generated,  Unicode,  UTF-8
              encoded  strings  that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot
              be edited.

          BackupRuleId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a rule used to  schedule  the  backup  of  a
              selection of resources.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The  type of Amazon Web Services resource to be backed up; for exam-
          ple, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an  Amazon
          Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.

       BytesTransferred -> (long)
          The size in bytes transferred to a backup vault at the time that the
          job status was queried.

       ExpectedCompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a job to back up resources is expected to  be
          completed,  in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The
          value of ExpectedCompletionDate is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For
          example,  the  value  1516925490.087  represents Friday, January 26,
          2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       StartBy -> (timestamp)
          Specifies the time in Unix format  and  Coordinated  Universal  Time
          (UTC)  when  a backup job must be started before it is canceled. The
          value is calculated by adding the  start  window  to  the  scheduled
          time.  So if the scheduled time were 6:00 PM and the start window is
          2 hours, the StartBy time would be 8:00 PM on  the  date  specified.
          The  value  of StartBy is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the
          value   1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

       BackupOptions -> (map)
          Represents the options specified as part of backup plan or on-demand
          backup job.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       BackupType -> (string)
          Represents the actual backup type selected for  a  backup  job.  For
          example,  if  a  successful Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)
          backup was taken, BackupType returns "WindowsVSS" . If BackupType is
          empty, then the backup type was a regular backup.
