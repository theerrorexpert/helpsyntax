OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be returned.

       --by-resource-arn (string)
          Returns only copy jobs that  match  the  specified  resource  Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN).

       --by-state (string)
          Returns only copy jobs that are in the specified state.

          Possible values:

          o CREATED

          o RUNNING

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

       --by-created-before (timestamp)
          Returns  only copy jobs that were created before the specified date.

       --by-created-after (timestamp)
          Returns only copy jobs that were created after the specified date.

       --by-resource-type (string)
          Returns only backup jobs for the specified resources:

          o DynamoDB for Amazon DynamoDB

          o EBS for Amazon Elastic Block Store

          o EC2 for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

          o EFS for Amazon Elastic File System

          o RDS for Amazon Relational Database Service

          o Aurora for Amazon Aurora

          o Storage Gateway for Storage Gateway

       --by-destination-vault-arn (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  uniquely  identifies  a  source
          backup      vault      to      copy      from;      for     example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       --by-account-id (string)
          The account ID to list the jobs from. Returns only copy jobs associ-
          ated with the specified account ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
