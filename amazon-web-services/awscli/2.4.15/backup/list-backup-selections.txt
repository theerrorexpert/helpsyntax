NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array containing metadata of the resources associated with
       the target backup plan.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-backup-selections
          --backup-plan-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --next-token (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       BackupSelectionsList -> (list)
          An array of backup selection list items  containing  metadata  about
          each resource in the list.

          (structure)
              Contains metadata about a BackupSelection object.

              SelectionId -> (string)
                 Uniquely identifies a request to assign a set of resources to
                 a backup plan.

              SelectionName -> (string)
                 The display name of a resource selection document.

              BackupPlanId -> (string)
                 Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a backup plan is created,  in  Unix  format
                 and  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of Creation-
                 Date is accurate to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the  value
                 1516925490.087    represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed
                 requests to be retried without the risk of running the opera-
                 tion twice. This parameter is optional.

                 If used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric  or
                 '-_.' characters.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to create
                 the     target     recovery     point;      for      example,
                 arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .
