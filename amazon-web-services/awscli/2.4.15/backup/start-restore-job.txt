       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-restore-job
          --recovery-point-arn <value>
          --metadata <value>
          --iam-role-arn <value>
          [--idempotency-token <value>]
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An ARN that uniquely  identifies  a  recovery  point;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       --metadata (map)
          A set of metadata key-value pairs. Contains information, such  as  a
          resource name, required to restore a recovery point.

          You  can  get configuration metadata about a resource at the time it
          was backed up by calling GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata .  However,
          values in addition to those provided by GetRecoveryPointRestoreMeta-
          data might be required to restore a resource. For example, you might
          need  to provide a new resource name if the original already exists.

          You need to specify specific metadata to restore an  Amazon  Elastic
          File System (Amazon EFS) instance:

          o file-system-id  :  The  ID  of  the Amazon EFS file system that is
            backed up by Backup. Returned in GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata .

          o Encrypted : A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the file
            system is encrypted. If KmsKeyId is specified, Encrypted  must  be
            set to true .

          o KmsKeyId  : Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is used
            to encrypt the restored file system. You can specify  a  key  from
            another  Amazon Web Services account provided that key it is prop-
            erly shared with your account via Amazon Web Services KMS.

          o PerformanceMode : Specifies the throughput mode of the  file  sys-
            tem.

          o CreationToken  : A user-supplied value that ensures the uniqueness
            (idempotency) of the request.

          o newFileSystem : A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that  the
            recovery point is restored to a new Amazon EFS file system.

          o ItemsToRestore : An array of one to five strings where each string
            is a file path. Use ItemsToRestore to restore  specific  files  or
            directories  rather than the entire file system. This parameter is
            optional. For example, "itemsToRestore":"[\"/my.test\"]" .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Backup  uses  to
          create     the     target     recovery     point;    for    example,
          arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A customer-chosen string that you can  use  to  distinguish  between
          otherwise identical calls to StartRestoreJob . Retrying a successful
          request with the same idempotency token results in a success message
          with no action taken.

       --resource-type (string)
          Starts  a  job  to restore a recovery point for one of the following
          resources:

          o DynamoDB for Amazon DynamoDB

          o EBS for Amazon Elastic Block Store

          o EC2 for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

          o EFS for Amazon Elastic File System

          o RDS for Amazon Relational Database Service

          o Aurora for Amazon Aurora

          o Storage Gateway for Storage Gateway

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RestoreJobId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies the job that restores a recovery point.
