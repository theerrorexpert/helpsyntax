LIST-BACKUP-PLANS()                                        LIST-BACKUP-PLANS()



NAME
       list-backup-plans -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all active backup plans for an authenticated account.
       The list contains information such as  Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs),
       plan  IDs,  creation  and  deletion dates, version IDs, plan names, and
       creator request IDs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-backup-plans
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--include-deleted | --no-include-deleted]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be returned.

       --include-deleted | --no-include-deleted (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value with a default value of FALSE that returns deleted
          backup plans when set to TRUE .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       BackupPlansList -> (list)
          An  array  of  backup plan list items containing metadata about your
          saved backup plans.

          (structure)
              Contains metadata about a backup plan.

              BackupPlanArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  that  uniquely  identifies  a

                 format and Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC).  The  value  of
                 CreationDate  is  accurate  to milliseconds. For example, the
                 value 1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,  2018

              DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time a backup plan is deleted, in Unix format
                 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Deletion-
                 Date  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the value
                 1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,    2018

                 A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed
                 requests to be retried without the risk of running the opera-
                 tion twice. This parameter is optional.

                 If  used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or

                 rule. A date and time, in Unix format and Coordinated Univer-
                 sal Time (UTC). The value of LastExecutionDate is accurate to
                 milliseconds.  For  example,  the value 1516925490.087 repre-

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        Specifies  an  object  containing  resource  type  and
                        backup  options.  The  only supported resource type is
                        Amazon EC2 instances with Windows Volume  Shadow  Copy
                        Service  (VSS).  For a CloudFormation example, see the
                        sample CloudFormation template to enable  Windows  VSS
                        in the Backup User Guide .

                        Valid values: EC2 .

                     BackupOptions -> (map)
                        Specifies  the  backup option for a selected resource.
                        This option is only available for Windows  VSS  backup
                        jobs.

                        Valid values:

                        Set to "WindowsVSS":"enabled" to enable the WindowsVSS
                        backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.

                        Set to "WindowsVSS":"disabled"  to  create  a  regular
                        backup.  The  WindowsVSS  option  is  not  enabled  by
                        default.

                        If you specify an invalid option, you get an  Invalid-
                        ParameterValueException exception.

                        For  more  information  about Windows VSS backups, see
                        Creating a VSS-Enabled Windows Backup .
