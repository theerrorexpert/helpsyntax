CREATE-BACKUP-PLAN()                                      CREATE-BACKUP-PLAN()



NAME
       create-backup-plan -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  backup  plan  using  a backup plan name and backup rules. A
       backup plan is a document that contains information that Backup uses to
       schedule tasks that create recovery points for resources.

       If  you  call  CreateBackupPlan  with  a  plan that already exists, you
       receive an AlreadyExistsException exception.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          --backup-plan <value>
          [--backup-plan-tags <value>]
          [--creator-request-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan (structure)
          Specifies the body of a backup plan. Includes a  BackupPlanName  and
          one or more sets of Rules .

          BackupPlanName -> (string)
              The display name of a backup plan. Must contain 1 to 50 alphanu-
              meric or '-_.' characters.

          Rules -> (list)
              An array of BackupRule objects, each of which specifies a sched-
              uled task that is used to back up a selection of resources.

              (structure)
                 Specifies  a  scheduled  task  used to back up a selection of
                 resources.

                 RuleName -> (string)
                     A display name for a backup rule. Must contain  1  to  50
                     alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

                 TargetBackupVaultName -> (string)
                     The name of a logical container where backups are stored.
                     Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique  to
                     the  account  used to create them and the Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Region where they are created. They consist of low-
                     ercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

                 ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                     A CRON expression in UTC specifying when Backup initiates
                     a backup job.

                 StartWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A value in minutes after a backup is scheduled  before  a
                     job  will  be  canceled if it doesn't start successfully.
                     This value is optional.

                 CompletionWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A value in minutes after a  backup  job  is  successfully
                     started  before  it  must be completed or it will be can-
                     celed by Backup. This value is optional.

                 Lifecycle -> (structure)
                     The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is  tran-
                     sitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup will
                     transition and expire backups automatically according  to
                     the lifecycle that you define.

                     Backups  transitioned  to  cold storage must be stored in
                     cold storage for a minimum of  90  days.  Therefore,  the
                     expire  after  days  setting must be 90 days greater than
                     the transition to cold after days setting. The transition
                     to  cold  after  days  setting  cannot be changed after a
                     backup has been transitioned to cold.

                     Only Amazon EFS file system backups can  be  transitioned
                     to cold storage.

                     MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies  the  number  of  days after creation that a
                        recovery point is moved to cold storage.

                     DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a
                        recovery  point  is  deleted.  Must be greater than 90
                        days plus MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

                 RecoveryPointTags -> (map)
                     To help organize your resources, you can assign your  own
                     metadata  to the resources that you create. Each tag is a
                     key-value pair.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 CopyActions -> (list)
                     An  array  of  CopyAction  objects,  which  contains  the
                     details of the copy operation.

                     (structure)
                        The details of the copy operation.

                        Lifecycle -> (structure)
                            Contains an array of Transition objects specifying
                            how long in days before a recovery  point  transi-
                            tions to cold storage or is deleted.

                            Backups  transitioned  to  cold  storage  must  be
                            stored in cold storage for a minimum of  90  days.
                            Therefore,  on  the console, the expire after days
                            setting must be 90 days greater than  the  transi-
                            tion to cold after days setting. The transition to
                            cold after days setting cannot be changed after  a
                            backup has been transitioned to cold.

                            Only Amazon EFS file system backups can be transi-
                            tioned to cold storage.

                            MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies the number  of  days  after  creation
                               that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.

                            DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies the number  of  days  after  creation
                               that  a  recovery  point  is  deleted.  Must be
                               greater than 90 days plus  MoveToColdStorageAf-
                               terDays .

                        DestinationBackupVaultArn -> (string)
                            An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely iden-
                            tifies the destination backup vault for the copied
                            backup.                For                example,
                            arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBack-
                            upVault .

                 EnableContinuousBackup -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Backup creates continuous backups. True
                     causes Backup to create  continuous  backups  capable  of
                     point-in-time  restore  (PITR).  False (or not specified)
                     causes Backup to create snapshot backups.

          AdvancedBackupSettings -> (list)
              Specifies a list of BackupOptions for each resource type.  These
              settings  are only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Ser-
              vice (VSS) backup jobs.

              (structure)
                 A list of backup options for each resource type.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     Specifies an object containing resource type  and  backup
                     options.  The  only supported resource type is Amazon EC2
                     instances with Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service  (VSS).
                     For  a CloudFormation example, see the sample CloudForma-
                     tion template to enable Windows VSS in  the  Backup  User
                     Guide .

                     Valid values: EC2 .

                 BackupOptions -> (map)
                     Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This
                     option is only available for Windows VSS backup jobs.

                     Valid values:

                     Set to "WindowsVSS":"enabled" to  enable  the  WindowsVSS
                     backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.

                     Set   to  "WindowsVSS":"disabled"  to  create  a  regular
                     backup. The WindowsVSS option is not enabled by  default.

                     If  you  specify an invalid option, you get an InvalidPa-
                     rameterValueException exception.

       --backup-plan-tags (map)
          To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to
          the resources that you create. Each tag is  a  key-value  pair.  The
          specified tags are assigned to all backups created with this plan.

       --creator-request-id (string)
          Identifies  the  request  and  allows  failed requests to be retried
          without the risk of running the  operation  twice.  If  the  request
          includes  a  CreatorRequestId  that matches an existing backup plan,
          that plan is returned. This parameter is optional.

          If used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric  or  '-_.'
          characters.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
