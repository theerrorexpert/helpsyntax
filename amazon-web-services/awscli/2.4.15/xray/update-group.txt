DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-group
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group-arn <value>]
          [--filter-expression <value>]
          [--insights-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The case-sensitive name of the group.

       --group-arn (string)
          The ARN that was generated upon creation.

       --filter-expression (string)
          The  updated  filter  expression defining criteria by which to group
          traces.

       --insights-configuration (structure)
          The structure containing configurations related to insights.

          o The InsightsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable  insights
            for the group or false to disable insights for the group.

          o The  NotifcationsEnabled  boolean  can  be  set  to true to enable
            insights notifications for the group. Notifications  can  only  be
            enabled on a group with InsightsEnabled set to true.

          InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Set  the  InsightsEnabled  value  to  true to enable insights or
              false to disable insights.

          NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Set the NotificationsEnabled value to true  to  enable  insights
              notifications. Notifications can only be enabled on a group with
              InsightsEnabled set to true.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InsightsEnabled=boolean,NotificationsEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InsightsEnabled": true|false,
            "NotificationsEnabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a group

       The following update-group example updates the  criteria  by  which  to
       accept  traces  into  the  group  named AdminGroup. You can specify the
       desired group by using either the group name or group ARN.

          aws xray update-group \
              --group-name "AdminGroup" \
              --group-arn "arn:aws:xray:us-west-2:123456789012:group/AdminGroup/123456789" \
              --filter-expression "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault}"

       Output:

          {
              "GroupName": "AdminGroup",
              "GroupARN": "arn:aws:xray:us-east-2:123456789012:group/AdminGroup/123456789",
              "FilterExpression": "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault}"
          }

       Settings with the AWS X-Ray API in the AWS X-Ray Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The  group that was updated. Contains the name of the group that was
          updated, the ARN of the group that was updated, the  updated  filter
          expression,  and  the  updated insight configuration assigned to the
          group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The unique case-sensitive name of the group.

          GroupARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the group generated  based  on
              the GroupName.

          FilterExpression -> (string)
              The filter expression defining the parameters to include traces.

          InsightsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The structure containing configurations related to insights.

              o The InsightsEnabled boolean can  be  set  to  true  to  enable
                insights  for  the  group or false to disable insights for the
                group.

              o The NotificationsEnabled boolean can be set to true to  enable
                insights  notifications  through  Amazon  EventBridge  for the
                group.

              InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set the InsightsEnabled value to true to enable  insights  or
                 false to disable insights.

              NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set the NotificationsEnabled value to true to enable insights
                 notifications. Notifications can only be enabled on  a  group
                 with InsightsEnabled set to true.
