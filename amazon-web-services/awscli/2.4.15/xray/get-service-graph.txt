GET-SERVICE-GRAPH()                                        GET-SERVICE-GRAPH()



NAME
       get-service-graph -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  document  that  describes  services that process incoming
       requests, and downstream services that they call as a result. Root ser-
       vices  process incoming requests and make calls to downstream services.
       Root services are applications that use the Amazon Web  Services  X-Ray
       SDK  .  Downstream  services can be other applications, Amazon Web Ser-
       vices resources, HTTP web APIs, or SQL databases.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-service-graph is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Services

SYNOPSIS
            get-service-graph
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time frame for which to generate a graph.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the timeframe for which to generate a graph.

       --group-name (string)
          The name of a group based on which you want to generate a graph.

       --group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a group based on which you want to
          generate a graph.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
