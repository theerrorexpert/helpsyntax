GET-GROUP()                                                        GET-GROUP()



NAME
       get-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves group resource details.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-group
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The case-sensitive name of the group.

       --group-arn (string)
          The ARN of the group that was generated on creation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a group

       The  following  get-group  example  displays  details for the specified
       group resource. The details include the group name, the group ARN,  and
       the  filter expression that defines the criteria for that group. Groups
       can also be retrieved by ARN.

          aws xray get-group \
              --group-name "AdminGroup"

       Output:

          {
              "Group": [
                  {
                      "GroupName": "AdminGroup",
                      "GroupARN": "arn:aws:xray:us-west-2:123456789012:group/AdminGroup/123456789",
                      "FilterExpression": "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault OR error}"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The  group  that  was requested. Contains the name of the group, the
          ARN of the group, the filter expression, and the insight  configura-
          tion assigned to the group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The unique case-sensitive name of the group.

          GroupARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the group generated based on
              the GroupName.

          FilterExpression -> (string)
              The filter expression defining the parameters to include traces.

          InsightsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The structure containing configurations related to insights.

              o The  InsightsEnabled  boolean  can  be  set  to true to enable
                insights for the group or false to disable  insights  for  the
                group.

              o The  NotificationsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable
                insights notifications  through  Amazon  EventBridge  for  the
                group.

              InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  the  InsightsEnabled value to true to enable insights or
                 false to disable insights.

              NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set the NotificationsEnabled value to true to enable insights
                 notifications.  Notifications  can only be enabled on a group
                 with InsightsEnabled set to true.
