DELETE-SAMPLING-RULE()                                  DELETE-SAMPLING-RULE()



NAME
       delete-sampling-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a sampling rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-sampling-rule
          [--rule-name <value>]
          [--rule-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-name (string)
          The name of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or ARN,
          but not both.

       --rule-arn (string)
          The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or  ARN,
          but not both.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a sampling rule

       The  following  delete-sampling-rule example deletes the specified sam-
       pling rule. You can specify the group by using either the group name or
       group ARN.

          aws xray delete-sampling-rule \
              --rule-name polling-scorekeep

OUTPUT
       SamplingRuleRecord -> (structure)
          The deleted rule definition and metadata.

          SamplingRule -> (structure)
              The sampling rule.

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either  name
                 or ARN, but not both.

              RuleARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name
                 or ARN, but not both.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 Matches the ARN of the Amazon Web Services resource on  which
                 the service runs.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The priority of the sampling rule.

              FixedRate -> (double)
                 The  percentage of matching requests to instrument, after the
                 reservoir is exhausted.

              ReservoirSize -> (integer)
                 A fixed number of matching requests to instrument per second,
                 prior  to  applying the fixed rate. The reservoir is not used
                 directly by services, but applies to all services  using  the
                 rule collectively.

              ServiceName -> (string)
                 Matches  the name that the service uses to identify itself in
                 segments.

              ServiceType -> (string)
                 Matches the origin that the service uses to identify its type
                 in segments.

                 Matches the hostname from a request URL.

              HTTPMethod -> (string)

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              When the rule was created.
