GET-TRACE-SUMMARIES()                                    GET-TRACE-SUMMARIES()



NAME
       get-trace-summaries -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time
       frame using an optional filter. To get the full traces, pass the  trace
       IDs to BatchGetTraces .

       A  filter  expression can target traced requests that hit specific ser-
       vice nodes or edges, have errors, or come from a known user. For  exam-
       ple,  the  following filter expression targets traces that pass through
       api.example.com :
          service("api.example.com")

       This filter expression finds  traces  that  have  an  annotation  named
       account with the value 12345 :
          annotation.account = "12345"

       For a full list of indexed fields and keywords that you can use in fil-
       ter expressions, see Using Filter Expressions in the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices X-Ray Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-trace-summaries is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: TraceSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            get-trace-summaries
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--time-range-type <value>]
          [--sampling | --no-sampling]
          [--sampling-strategy <value>]
          [--filter-expression <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time frame for which to retrieve traces.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time frame for which to retrieve traces.

       --time-range-type (string)
          A parameter to indicate whether to query trace summaries by  TraceId
          or Event time.

          Possible values:

          o TraceId

          o Event

       --sampling | --no-sampling (boolean)
          Set  to true to get summaries for only a subset of available traces.

       --sampling-strategy (structure)
          A parameter to indicate whether to enable  sampling  on  trace  sum-
          maries. Input parameters are Name and Value.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of a sampling rule.

          Value -> (double)
              The value of a sampling rule.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "PartialScan"|"FixedRate",
            "Value": double
          }

       --filter-expression (string)
          Specify a filter expression to retrieve trace summaries for services
          or requests that meet certain requirements.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
