NAME
       get-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves all active group details.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-groups  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Groups

SYNOPSIS
            get-groups
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve all groups

       The following example displays details for all active group.

                      "GroupARN": "arn:aws:xray:us-west-2:123456789012:group/AdminGroup/123456789",
                      "FilterExpression": "service(\"example.com\") {fault OR error}"
                  },
                  {
                      "GroupName": "SDETGroup",
                      "GroupARN": "arn:aws:xray:us-west-2:123456789012:group/SDETGroup/987654321",
                      "FilterExpression": "responsetime > 2"
                  }
              ]
          }

              Details for a group without metadata.

              GroupName -> (string)
                 The unique case-sensitive name of the group.

              GroupARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the group generated based on the GroupName.

              FilterExpression -> (string)
                 The  filter  expression  defining  the  parameters to include
                 traces.

              InsightsConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The structure containing configurations related to  insights.

                 o The  InsightsEnabled  boolean  can be set to true to enable
                   insights for the group or false to disable insights for the
                   group.

                 o The  NotificationsEnabled  boolean  can  be  set to true to
