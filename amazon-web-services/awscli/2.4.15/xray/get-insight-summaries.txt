SYNOPSIS
            get-insight-summaries
          [--states <value>]
          [--group-arn <value>]
          [--group-name <value>]
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --states (list)
          The list of insight states.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            ACTIVE
            CLOSED

       --group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the group. Required if the  Group-
          Name isn't provided.

       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group. Required if the GroupARN isn't provided.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  beginning  of the time frame in which the insights started. The
          start time can't be more than 30 days old.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time frame in which the insights ended. The end  time
          can't be more than 30 days old.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to display.

       --next-token (string)
          Pagination token.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
