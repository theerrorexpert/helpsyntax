NAME
       get-sampling-statistic-summaries -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  recent sampling results for all sampling
       rules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-sampling-statistic-summaries is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: SamplingStatisticSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            get-sampling-statistic-summaries
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SamplingStatisticSummaries -> (list)
          Information  about the number of requests instrumented for each sam-
          pling rule.

          (structure)
              Aggregated request sampling data for a sampling rule across  all
              services for a 10-second window.

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the sampling rule.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The start time of the reporting window.

              RequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of requests that matched the rule.

              BorrowCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  requests  recorded  with  borrowed reservoir
                 quota.

              SampledCount -> (integer)
                 The number of requests recorded.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token.
