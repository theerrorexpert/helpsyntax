       --tags (list)
          A map that contains one or more tag keys and tag values to attach to
          an X-Ray group or sampling rule. For more information about ways  to
          use  tags,  see  Tagging Amazon Web Services resources in the Amazon
          Web Services General Reference .

          The following restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of user-applied tags per resource: 50

          o Maximum tag key length: 128 Unicode characters

          o Maximum tag value length: 256 Unicode characters

          o Valid values for key and value: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, space, and the fol-
            lowing characters: _ . : / = + - and @

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Don't  use aws: as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for Amazon Web
            Services use. You cannot edit or delete system tags.

          (structure)
              A map that contains tag keys and tag values to attach to an Ama-
              zon Web Services X-Ray group or sampling rule. For more informa-
              tion about ways to use tags, see  Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services
              resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

              The following restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of user-applied tags per resource: 50

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Don't  use aws: as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for Amazon

              Key -> (string)
                 A tag key, such as Stage or Name . A tag key cannot be empty.
                 The  key  can be a maximum of 128 characters, and can contain
                 only Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the  follow-
                 ing special characters: + - = . _ : /

              Value -> (string)
                 An  optional tag value, such as Production or test-only . The
                 value can be a maximum of 255 characters,  and  contain  only
                 Unicode  letters,  numbers,  or  separators, or the following

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
