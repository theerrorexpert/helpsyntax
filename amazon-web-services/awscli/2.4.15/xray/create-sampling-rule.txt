CREATE-SAMPLING-RULE()                                  CREATE-SAMPLING-RULE()



NAME
       create-sampling-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented applica-
       tions. Services retrieve rules with  GetSamplingRules  ,  and  evaluate
       each  rule  in  ascending order of priority for each request. If a rule
       matches, the service records a trace, borrowing it from  the  reservoir
       size.  After  10  seconds,  the  service  reports  back  to  X-Ray with
       GetSamplingTargets to get updated versions of  each  in-use  rule.  The
       updated rule contains a trace quota that the service can use instead of
       borrowing from the reservoir.

SYNOPSIS
            create-sampling-rule
          --sampling-rule <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sampling-rule (structure)
          The rule definition.

          RuleName -> (string)
              The name of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name  or
              ARN, but not both.

          RuleARN -> (string)
              The  ARN  of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or
              ARN, but not both.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              Matches the ARN of the Amazon Web Services resource on which the
              service runs.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The priority of the sampling rule.

          FixedRate -> (double)
              The  percentage  of  matching  requests to instrument, after the
              reservoir is exhausted.

          ReservoirSize -> (integer)
              A fixed number of matching requests to  instrument  per  second,
              prior  to  applying  the  fixed  rate. The reservoir is not used
              directly by services, but applies to all services using the rule
              collectively.

          ServiceName -> (string)
              Matches  the  name  that  the service uses to identify itself in
              segments.

          ServiceType -> (string)
              Matches the origin that the service uses to identify its type in
              segments.

          Host -> (string)
              Matches the hostname from a request URL.

          HTTPMethod -> (string)
              Matches the HTTP method of a request.

          URLPath -> (string)
              Matches the path from a request URL.

          Version -> (integer)
              The version of the sampling rule format (1 ).

       --tags (list)
          A map that contains one or more tag keys and tag values to attach to
          an X-Ray sampling rule. For more information about ways to use tags,
          see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources in the Amazon Web Services
          General Reference .

          The following restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of user-applied tags per resource: 50

          o Maximum tag key length: 128 Unicode characters

          o Maximum tag value length: 256 Unicode characters

          o Valid values for key and value: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, space, and the fol-
            lowing characters: _ . : / = + - and @

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Don't  use aws: as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for Amazon Web
            Services use.

          (structure)
              A map that contains tag keys and tag values to attach to an Ama-
              zon Web Services X-Ray group or sampling rule. For more informa-
              tion about ways to use tags, see  Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services
              resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

              The following restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of user-applied tags per resource: 50

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Don't  use aws: as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for Amazon
                Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete system tags.

              Key -> (string)
                 A tag key, such as Stage or Name . A tag key cannot be empty.
                 The  key  can be a maximum of 128 characters, and can contain
                 only Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the  follow-
                 ing special characters: + - = . _ : /

              Value -> (string)
                 An  optional tag value, such as Production or test-only . The
                 value can be a maximum of 255 characters,  and  contain  only
                 Unicode  letters,  numbers,  or  separators, or the following
                 special characters: + - = . _ : /

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a sampling rule

       The following create-sampling-rule example creates a  rule  to  control
       sampling behavior for instrumented applications. The rules are provided
       by a JSON file. The majority of the sampling rule fields  are  required
       to create the rule.
