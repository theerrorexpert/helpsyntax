START-SIGNING-JOB()                                        START-SIGNING-JOB()



NAME
       start-signing-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates  a  signing job to be performed on the code provided. Signing
       jobs are viewable by the ListSigningJobs operation for two years  after
       they are performed. Note the following requirements:

       o You must create an Amazon S3 source bucket. For more information, see
         Create a Bucket in the Amazon S3 Getting Started Guide .

       o Your S3 source bucket must be version enabled.

       o You must create an S3 destination bucket. Code signing uses  your  S3
         destination bucket to write your signed code.

       o You specify the name of the source and destination buckets when call-
         ing the StartSigningJob operation.

       o You must also specify a request token that identifies your request to
         code signing.

       You  can  call the  DescribeSigningJob and the  ListSigningJobs actions
       after you call StartSigningJob .

       For  a  Java  example  that  shows  how  to  use   this   action,   see
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/

SYNOPSIS
            start-signing-job
          --source <value>
          --destination <value>
          --profile-name <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--profile-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source (structure)
          The  S3  bucket that contains the object to sign or a BLOB that con-
          tains your raw code.

          s3 -> (structure)
              The S3Source object.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              key -> (string)
                 Key name of the bucket object  that  contains  your  unsigned
                 code.

              version -> (string)
                 Version  of  your  source  image  in  your version enabled S3
                 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3={bucketName=string,key=string,version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3": {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "key": "string",
              "version": "string"
            }
          }

       --destination (structure)
          The S3 bucket in which to save your signed object.  The  destination
          contains the name of your bucket and an optional prefix.

          s3 -> (structure)
              The S3Destination object.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              prefix -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  S3  prefix that you can use to limit responses to
                 those that begin with the specified prefix.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3={bucketName=string,prefix=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3": {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "prefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --profile-name (string)
          The name of the signing profile.

       --client-request-token (string)
          String that identifies the signing  request.  All  calls  after  the
          first  that  use  this  token  return the same response as the first
          call.

       --profile-owner (string)
          The AWS account ID of the signing profile owner.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start a signing job

       The following start-signing-job example starts a  signing  job  on  the
       code found at the specified source. It uses the specified profile to do
       the signing and places the signed code in the specified destination.

          aws signer start-signing-job \
              --source 's3={bucketName=signer-source,key=MyCode.rb,version=PNyFaUTgsQh5ZdMCcoCe6pT1gOpgB_M4}' \
              --destination 's3={bucketName=signer-destination,prefix=signed-}' \
              --profile-name MyProfile7

       The output is the ID of the signing job.

          {
              "jobId": "2065c468-73e2-4385-a6c9-0123456789abc"
          }

OUTPUT
       jobId -> (string)
          The ID of your signing job.

       jobOwner -> (string)
          The AWS account ID of the signing job owner.
