DESCRIBE-SIGNING-JOB()                                  DESCRIBE-SIGNING-JOB()



NAME
       describe-signing-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about a specific code signing job. You specify the
       job by using the jobId value that is returned by  the   StartSigningJob
       operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-signing-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the signing job on input.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobId -> (string)
          The ID of the signing job on output.

       source -> (structure)
          The object that contains the name of your  S3  bucket  or  your  raw
          code.

          s3 -> (structure)
              The S3Source object.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              key -> (string)
                 Key  name  of  the  bucket object that contains your unsigned
                 code.

              version -> (string)
                 Version of your source  image  in  your  version  enabled  S3
                 bucket.

       signingMaterial -> (structure)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your code signing certificate.

          certificateArn -> (string)
