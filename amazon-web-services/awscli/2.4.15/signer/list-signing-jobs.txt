LIST-SIGNING-JOBS()                                        LIST-SIGNING-JOBS()



NAME
       list-signing-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  your  signing jobs. You can use the maxResults parameter to
       limit the number of signing jobs that are returned in the response.  If
       additional  jobs  remain to be listed, code signing returns a nextToken
       value. Use this value in subsequent calls to ListSigningJobs  to  fetch
       the  remaining  values.  You  can continue calling ListSigningJobs with
       your maxResults parameter and with new values that code signing returns
       in  the  nextToken  parameter  until all of your signing jobs have been
       returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-signing-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: jobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-signing-jobs
          [--status <value>]
          [--platform-id <value>]
          [--requested-by <value>]
          [--is-revoked | --no-is-revoked]
          [--signature-expires-before <value>]
          [--signature-expires-after <value>]
          [--job-invoker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          A status value with which to filter your results.

          Possible values:

          o InProgress

          o Failed

          o Succeeded

       --platform-id (string)
          The  ID  of microcontroller platform that you specified for the dis-
          tribution of your code image.

       --requested-by (string)
          The IAM principal that requested the signing job.

       --is-revoked | --no-is-revoked (boolean)
          Filters results to return only signing jobs with revoked signatures.

       --signature-expires-before (timestamp)
          Filters results to return only signing jobs with signatures expiring
          before a specified timestamp.

       --signature-expires-after (timestamp)
          Filters results to return only signing jobs with signatures expiring
          after a specified timestamp.

       --job-invoker (string)
          Filters results to return only signing jobs initiated by a specified
          IAM entity.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all signing jobs

       The  following  list-signing-jobs  example  displays  details about all
       signing jobs for the account.

       In this example, two jobs are returned, one successful, and one failed.
