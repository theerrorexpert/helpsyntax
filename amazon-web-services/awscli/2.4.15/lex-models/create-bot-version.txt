CREATE-BOT-VERSION()                                      CREATE-BOT-VERSION()



NAME
       create-bot-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new version of the bot based on the $LATEST version. If the
       $LATEST version of this resource hasn't changed since you  created  the
       last  version,  Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the
       last created version.

       NOTE:
          You can update only the $LATEST version of the bot. You can't update
          the  numbered  versions  that  you  create with the CreateBotVersion
          operation.

       When you create the first version of a bot, Amazon Lex sets the version
       to  1.  Subsequent  versions  increment by 1. For more information, see
       versioning-intro .

       This operation requires permission for the lex:CreateBotVersion action.

SYNOPSIS
            create-bot-version
          --name <value>
          [--checksum <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name  of  the bot that you want to create a new version of. The
          name is case sensitive.

       --checksum (string)
          Identifies a specific revision of the $LATEST version of the bot. If
          you specify a checksum and the $LATEST version of the bot has a dif-
          ferent checksum, a PreconditionFailedException exception is returned
          and Amazon Lex doesn't publish a new version. If you don't specify a
          checksum, Amazon Lex publishes the $LATEST version.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          responseCard -> (string)
              At  runtime, if the client is using the PostText API, Amazon Lex
              includes the response card in the response. It  substitutes  all
              of  the  session  attributes and slot values for placeholders in
              the response card.

       status -> (string)

          the bot, it sets status to READY . If Amazon  Lex  can't  build  the
          bot,  it  sets  status to FAILED . Amazon Lex returns the reason for
          the failure in the failureReason response element.
