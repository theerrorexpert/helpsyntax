DELETE-BOT()                                                      DELETE-BOT()



NAME
       delete-bot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  all  versions  of  the  bot, including the $LATEST version. To
       delete a specific version of the bot, use the  DeleteBotVersion  opera-
       tion.  The  DeleteBot  operation  doesn't  immediately  remove  the bot
       schema. Instead, it is marked for deletion and removed later.

       Amazon Lex stores utterances indefinitely for improving the ability  of
       your  bot  to  respond to user inputs. These utterances are not removed
       when the bot is deleted. To remove the utterances, use  the   DeleteUt-
       terances operation.

       If  a  bot  has  an  alias, you can't delete it. Instead, the DeleteBot
       operation returns a ResourceInUseException exception  that  includes  a
       reference  to the alias that refers to the bot. To remove the reference
       to the bot, delete the alias. If you  get  the  same  exception  again,
       delete the referring alias until the DeleteBot operation is successful.

       This operation requires permissions for the lex:DeleteBot action.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bot
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the bot. The name is case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
