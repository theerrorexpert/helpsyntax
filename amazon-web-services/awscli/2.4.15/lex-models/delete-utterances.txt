DELETE-UTTERANCES()                                        DELETE-UTTERANCES()



NAME
       delete-utterances -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes stored utterances.

       Amazon  Lex  stores  the utterances that users send to your bot. Utter-
       ances are stored for 15 days for use with the  GetUtterancesView opera-
       tion,  and then stored indefinitely for use in improving the ability of
       your bot to respond to user input.

       Use the DeleteUtterances operation to manually delete stored utterances
       for  a  specific  user.  When  you  use the DeleteUtterances operation,
       utterances stored for improving your bot's ability to respond  to  user
       input  are  deleted  immediately.  Utterances  stored  for use with the
       GetUtterancesView operation are deleted after 15 days.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  for  the   lex:DeleteUtterances
       action.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-utterances
          --bot-name <value>
          --user-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-name (string)
          The name of the bot that stored the utterances.

       --user-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the user that made the utterances. This is
          the user ID that was sent in the PostContent or  PostText  operation
          request that contained the utterance.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
