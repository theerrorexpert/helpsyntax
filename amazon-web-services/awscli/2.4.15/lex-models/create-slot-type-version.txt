CREATE-SLOT-TYPE-VERSION()                          CREATE-SLOT-TYPE-VERSION()



NAME
       create-slot-type-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  version of a slot type based on the $LATEST version of
       the specified slot type. If the $LATEST version of  this  resource  has
       not changed since the last version that you created, Amazon Lex doesn't
       create a new version. It returns the last version that you created.

       NOTE:
          You can update only the $LATEST version of a slot  type.  You  can't
          update  the  numbered  versions that you create with the CreateSlot-
          TypeVersion operation.

       When you create a version of a slot type, Amazon Lex sets  the  version
       to  1.  Subsequent  versions  increment by 1. For more information, see
       versioning-intro .

       This operation requires permissions for  the  lex:CreateSlotTypeVersion
       action.

SYNOPSIS
            create-slot-type-version
          --name <value>
          [--checksum <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the slot type that you want to create a new version for.
          The name is case sensitive.

       --checksum (string)
          Checksum for the $LATEST version of the slot type that you  want  to
          publish.  If  you  specify a checksum and the $LATEST version of the
          slot type has a different checksum, Amazon Lex returns  a  Precondi-
          tionFailedException  exception  and doesn't publish the new version.
          If you don't specify a checksum, Amazon Lex  publishes  the  $LATEST
          version.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       name -> (string)
          The name of the slot type.

       description -> (string)
          A description of the slot type.

       enumerationValues -> (list)
          A  list of EnumerationValue objects that defines the values that the
          slot type can take.

          (structure)
              Each slot type can have a set of values. Each enumeration  value
              represents a value the slot type can take.

              For  example,  a  pizza ordering bot could have a slot type that
              specifies the type of crust that the pizza should have. The slot
              type could include the values

              o thick

              o thin

              o stuffed

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the slot type.

              synonyms -> (list)
                 Additional values related to the slot type value.

                 (string)

       lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the slot type was updated. When you create a resource,
          the creation date and last update date are the same.

       createdDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the slot type was created.

       version -> (string)
          The version assigned to the new slot type version.

       checksum -> (string)
          Checksum of the $LATEST version of the slot type.

       valueSelectionStrategy -> (string)
          The strategy that Amazon Lex uses to  determine  the  value  of  the
          slot. For more information, see  PutSlotType .

       parentSlotTypeSignature -> (string)
          The built-in slot type used a the parent of the slot type.

       slotTypeConfigurations -> (list)
          Configuration  information  that  extends  the  parent built-in slot
          type.

          (structure)
              Provides configuration information for a slot type.

              regexConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

                 pattern -> (string)
                     A regular expression used to  validate  the  value  of  a
                     slot.

                     Use  a  standard  regular expression. Amazon Lex supports
                     the following characters in the regular expression:

                     o A-Z, a-z

                     o 0-9

                     o Unicode characters ("u<Unicode>")

                     Represent Unicode characters with four digits, for  exam-
                     ple "u0041" or "u005A".

                     The  following  regular expression operators are not sup-
                     ported:

                     o Infinite repeaters:
                       *
                       , +, or {x,} with no upper bound.

                     o Wild card (.)
