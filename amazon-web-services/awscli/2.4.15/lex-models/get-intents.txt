GET-INTENTS()                                                    GET-INTENTS()



NAME
       get-intents -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns intent information as follows:

       o If you specify the nameContains field, returns the $LATEST version of
         all intents that contain the specified string.

       o If you don't specify  the  nameContains  field,  returns  information
         about the $LATEST version of all intents.

       The operation requires permission for the lex:GetIntents action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-intents  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: intents

SYNOPSIS
            get-intents
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-contains (string)
          Substring to match in intent names. An intent will  be  returned  if
          any  part  of  its  name  matches  the substring. For example, "xyz"
          matches both "xyzabc" and "abcxyz."

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       intents -> (list)
          An array of Intent objects. For more information, see  PutBot .

          (structure)
              Provides information about an intent.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the intent.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the intent.

              lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that  the  intent  was updated. When you create an
                 intent, the creation date and last updated date are the same.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the intent was created.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of the intent.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response  is  truncated, the response includes a pagination
          token that you can specify in your next request to  fetch  the  next
          page of intents.
