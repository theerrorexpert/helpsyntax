NAME
       get-migration -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  details about an ongoing or complete migration from an Amazon
       Lex V1 bot to an Amazon Lex V2 bot. Use  this  operation  to  view  the
       migration alerts and warnings related to the migration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-migration
          --migration-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --migration-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the migration to view. The migrationID is
          returned by the operation.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

          The IAM role that Amazon Lex uses to run the Amazon Lex V2 bot.

       migrationStatus -> (string)
          Indicates the status of the migration. When the status  is  COMPLETE
          the migration is finished and the bot is available in Amazon Lex V2.
          There may be alerts and warnings that need to be  resolved  to  com-
          plete the migration.

       migrationStrategy -> (string)
          The strategy used to conduct the migration.

          o CREATE_NEW - Creates a new Amazon Lex V2 bot and migrates the Ama-

          o UPDATE_EXISTING - Overwrites the existing Amazon Lex V2 bot  meta-
            data  and  the  locale being migrated. It doesn't change any other
            locales in the Amazon Lex V2 bot. If the locale doesn't  exist,  a
            new locale is created in the Amazon Lex V2 bot.
