GET-UTTERANCES-VIEW()                                    GET-UTTERANCES-VIEW()



NAME
       get-utterances-view -

DESCRIPTION
       Use the GetUtterancesView operation to get information about the utter-
       ances that your users have made to your bot. You can use this  list  to
       tune the utterances that your bot responds to.

       For  example,  say  that you have created a bot to order flowers. After
       your users have used your bot for a while,  use  the  GetUtterancesView
       operation to see the requests that they have made and whether they have
       been successful. You might find that the utterance "I want flowers"  is
       not  being recognized. You could add this utterance to the OrderFlowers
       intent so that your bot recognizes that utterance.

       After you publish a new version of a bot, you can get information about
       the  old  version  and  the new so that you can compare the performance
       across the two versions.

       Utterance statistics are generated once a day. Data  is  available  for
       the  last  15 days. You can request information for up to 5 versions of
       your bot in each request. Amazon Lex returns the most  frequent  utter-
       ances  received  by  the bot in the last 15 days. The response contains
       information about a maximum of 100 utterances for each version.

       If you set childDirected field to true when you created  your  bot,  if
       you  are using slot obfuscation with one or more slots, or if you opted
       out of participating in improving Amazon Lex, utterances are not avail-
       able.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  for  the  lex:GetUtterancesView
       action.

SYNOPSIS
            get-utterances-view
          --bot-name <value>
          --bot-versions <value>
          --status-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-name (string)
          The name of the  bot  for  which  utterance  information  should  be
          returned.

       --bot-versions (list)
          An  array  of bot versions for which utterance information should be
          returned. The limit is 5 versions per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --status-type (string)
          To return utterances that were recognized and handled, use  Detected
          . To return utterances that were not recognized, use Missed .

          Possible values:

          o Detected

          o Missed

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
