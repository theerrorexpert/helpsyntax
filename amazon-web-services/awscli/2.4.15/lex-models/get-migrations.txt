SYNOPSIS
            get-migrations
          [--sort-by-attribute <value>]
          [--sort-by-order <value>]
          [--v1-bot-name-contains <value>]
          [--migration-status-equals <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by-attribute (string)
          The  field  to  sort  the list of migrations by. You can sort by the
          Amazon Lex V1 bot name or the date and time that the  migration  was
          started.

          Possible values:

          o V1_BOT_NAME

          o MIGRATION_DATE_TIME

       --sort-by-order (string)
          The order so sort the list.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --v1-bot-name-contains (string)
          Filters the list to contain only bots whose name contains the speci-
          fied string. The string is matched anywhere in bot name.

       --migration-status-equals (string)
          Filters the list to contain only migrations in the specified  state.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  migrations  to return in the response. The
          default is 10.

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token that fetches the next page of migrations. If  the
          response  to this operation is truncated, Amazon Lex returns a pagi-
          nation token in the response. To fetch the next page of  migrations,
          specify the pagination token in the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
