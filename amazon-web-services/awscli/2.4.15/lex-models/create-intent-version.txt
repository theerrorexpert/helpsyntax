CREATE-INTENT-VERSION()                                CREATE-INTENT-VERSION()



NAME
       create-intent-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new version of an intent based on the $LATEST version of the
       intent. If the $LATEST version of this intent hasn't changed since  you
       last  updated  it,  Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns
       the last version you created.

       NOTE:
          You can update only the $LATEST version of  the  intent.  You  can't
          update  the  numbered  versions  that  you create with the CreateIn-
          tentVersion operation.

       When you create a version of an intent, Amazon Lex sets the version  to
       1.  Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see  ver-
       sioning-intro .

       This operation requires permissions to perform the lex:CreateIntentVer-
       sion action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-intent-version
          --name <value>
          [--checksum <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the intent that you want to create a new version of. The
          name is case sensitive.

       --checksum (string)
          Checksum of the $LATEST version of the intent that should be used to
          create  the  new  version. If you specify a checksum and the $LATEST
          version of the intent has a different checksum, Amazon Lex returns a
          PreconditionFailedException exception and doesn't publish a new ver-
          sion. If you don't specify a  checksum,  Amazon  Lex  publishes  the
          $LATEST version.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       description -> (string)
          A description of the intent.

       slots -> (list)
          An array of slot types that defines the information required to ful-
          fill the intent.

          (structure)
              Identifies the version of a specific slot.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the slot.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the slot.

              slotConstraint -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the slot is required or optional.

              slotType -> (string)
                 The type of the slot, either a  custom  slot  type  that  you
                 defined or one of the built-in slot types.

              slotTypeVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the slot type.

              valueElicitationPrompt -> (structure)
                 The prompt that Amazon Lex uses to elicit the slot value from
                 the user.

                 messages -> (list)
                     An array of objects, each of  which  provides  a  message
                     string  and  its type. You can specify the message string
                     in plain text or  in  Speech  Synthesis  Markup  Language
                     (SSML).

                     (structure)
                        The  message object that provides the message text and
                        its type.

                        contentType -> (string)
                            The content type of the message string.

                        content -> (string)
                            The text of the message.

                        groupNumber -> (integer)
                            Identifies the  message  group  that  the  message
                            belongs to. When a group is assigned to a message,
                            Amazon Lex returns one message from each group  in
                            the response.

                 maxAttempts -> (integer)
                     The number of times to prompt the user for information.

                 responseCard -> (string)
                     A  response card. Amazon Lex uses this prompt at runtime,
                     in the PostText  API  response.  It  substitutes  session
                     attributes  and  slot  values  for  placeholders  in  the
                     response card. For more information, see  ex-resp-card  .

              priority -> (integer)
                 Directs  Amazon  Lex  the  order in which to elicit this slot
                 value from the user. For example, if the intent has two slots
                 with priorities 1 and 2, AWS Amazon Lex first elicits a value
                 for the slot with priority 1.

                 If multiple slots share the same priority, the order in which
                 Amazon Lex elicits values is arbitrary.

              sampleUtterances -> (list)
                 If you know a specific pattern with which users might respond
                 to an Amazon Lex request for a slot value,  you  can  provide
                 those  utterances  to  improve accuracy. This is optional. In
                 most cases, Amazon  Lex  is  capable  of  understanding  user
                 utterances.

                 (string)

              responseCard -> (string)
                 A  set  of  possible  responses  for  the  slot  type used by
                 text-based  clients.  A  user  chooses  an  option  from  the
                 response card, instead of using text to reply.

              obfuscationSetting -> (string)
                 Determines  whether a slot is obfuscated in conversation logs
                 and stored utterances. When you obfuscate a slot,  the  value
                 is  replaced by the slot name in curly braces ({}). For exam-
                 ple, if the slot name is "full_name", obfuscated  values  are
                 replaced  with  "{full_name}". For more information, see Slot
                 Obfuscation .

              defaultValueSpec -> (structure)
                 A list of default values for the  slot.  Default  values  are
                 used  when  Amazon  Lex hasn't determined a value for a slot.
                 You can specify default values from context  variables,  ses-
                 sion attributes, and defined values.

                 defaultValueList -> (list)
                     The  default values for a slot. You can specify more than
                     one default. For example, you can specify a default value
                     to  use  from  a  matching  context  variable,  a session
                     attribute, or a fixed value.

                     The default value chosen is selected based on  the  order
                     that  you  specify  them in the list. For example, if you
                     specify a context variable and  a  fixed  value  in  that
                     order,  Amazon  Lex  uses  the  context variable if it is
                     available, else it uses the fixed value.

                     (structure)
                        A default value for a slot.

                        defaultValue -> (string)
                            The default value for the slot.  You  can  specify
                            one of the following:

                            o #context-name.slot-name   -   The   slot   value
                              "slot-name" in the context "context-name."

                            o {attribute} - The  slot  value  of  the  session
                              attribute "attribute."

                            o 'value' - The discrete value "value."

          intent before fulfilling it.

          messages -> (list)
              An array of objects, each of which provides a message string and
              its type. You can specify the message string in plain text or in
              Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).

              (structure)
