GET-BOT-CHANNEL-ASSOCIATIONS()                  GET-BOT-CHANNEL-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       get-bot-channel-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  all of the channels associated with the specified
       bot.

       The GetBotChannelAssociations operation requires  permissions  for  the
       lex:GetBotChannelAssociations action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-bot-channel-associations  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: botChannelAssociations

SYNOPSIS
            get-bot-channel-associations
          --bot-name <value>
          --bot-alias <value>
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon Lex bot in the association.

       --bot-alias (string)
          An alias pointing to the specific version of the Amazon Lex  bot  to
          which this association is being made.

       --name-contains (string)
          Substring to match in channel association names. An association will
          be returned if any part of its name matches the substring. For exam-
          ple,  "xyz"  matches  both  "xyzabc" and "abcxyz." To return all bot
          channel associations, use a hyphen ("-") as the nameContains parame-
          ter.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 o IN_PROGRESS - Channel creation is in progress.

                 o FAILED - There was  an  error  creating  the  channel.  For
                   information about the reason for the failure, see the fail-
