PUT-SLOT-TYPE()                                                PUT-SLOT-TYPE()



NAME
       put-slot-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a custom slot type or replaces an existing custom slot type.

       To  create  a  custom slot type, specify a name for the slot type and a
       set of enumeration values, which are the values that  a  slot  of  this
       type can assume. For more information, see  how-it-works .

       If  you  specify  the  name of an existing slot type, the fields in the
       request replace the existing values in the $LATEST version of the  slot
       type.  Amazon  Lex  removes  the  fields  that you don't provide in the
       request. If you don't specify required fields,  Amazon  Lex  throws  an
       exception. When you update the $LATEST version of a slot type, if a bot
       uses the $LATEST version of an intent that contains the slot type,  the
       bot's status field is set to NOT_BUILT .

       This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutSlotType action.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the slot type. The name is not case sensitive.

          The  name  can't match a built-in slot type name, or a built-in slot
          type name with "AMAZON." removed. For example, because  there  is  a
          built-in  slot  type  called AMAZON.DATE , you can't create a custom
          slot type called DATE .

          For a list of built-in slot types, see Slot Type  Reference  in  the
          Alexa Skills Kit .

       --description (string)
          A description of the slot type.

       --enumeration-values (list)
          A  list of EnumerationValue objects that defines the values that the
          slot type can take. Each value can have a list of synonyms  ,  which
          are  additional  values  that  help train the machine learning model
          about the values that it resolves for a slot.

          A regular expression slot type doesn't require  enumeration  values.
          All other slot types require a list of enumeration values.

          When  Amazon  Lex  resolves  a slot value, it generates a resolution
          list that contains up to five possible values for the slot.  If  you
          are  using  a Lambda function, this resolution list is passed to the
          function. If you are not using a Lambda function you can  choose  to
          return  the  value  that  the user entered or the first value in the
          resolution list as the slot value. The valueSelectionStrategy  field
          indicates the option to use.

          (structure)
              Each  slot type can have a set of values. Each enumeration value
              represents a value the slot type can take.

              For example, a pizza ordering bot could have a  slot  type  that
              specifies the type of crust that the pizza should have. The slot
              type could include the values

              o thick

              o thin

              o stuffed

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the slot type.

              synonyms -> (list)
                 Additional values related to the slot type value.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          value=string,synonyms=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "value": "string",
              "synonyms": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --checksum (string)
          Identifies a specific revision of the $LATEST version.

          When you create a new slot type, leave the checksum field blank.  If
          you specify a checksum you get a BadRequestException exception.

          When  you  want to update a slot type, set the checksum field to the
          checksum of the most recent revision of the $LATEST version. If  you
          don't  specify the checksum field, or if the checksum does not match
          the $LATEST version, you get  a  PreconditionFailedException  excep-
          tion.

       --value-selection-strategy (string)
          Determines  the  slot  resolution  strategy  that Amazon Lex uses to
          return slot type values. The field can be set to one of the  follow-
          ing values:

          o ORIGINAL_VALUE  -  Returns  the  value entered by the user, if the
            user value is similar to the slot value.

          o TOP_RESOLUTION - If there is  a  resolution  list  for  the  slot,
            return  the  first  value  in the resolution list as the slot type
            value. If there is no resolution list, null is returned.

          If you don't specify the valueSelectionStrategy  ,  the  default  is
          ORIGINAL_VALUE .

          Possible values:

          o ORIGINAL_VALUE

          o TOP_RESOLUTION

       --create-version | --no-create-version (boolean)
          When set to true a new numbered version of the slot type is created.
          This is the same as calling the CreateSlotTypeVersion operation.  If
          you do not specify createVersion , the default is false .

       --parent-slot-type-signature (string)
          The built-in slot type used as the parent of the slot type. When you
          define a parent slot type, the new slot type has  all  of  the  same
          configuration as the parent.

          Only AMAZON.AlphaNumeric is supported.

       --slot-type-configurations (list)
          Configuration  information  that  extends  the  parent built-in slot
          type. The configuration is added to the settings for the parent slot
          type.

          (structure)
              Provides configuration information for a slot type.

              regexConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

                 pattern -> (string)
                     A  regular  expression  used  to  validate the value of a
                     slot.

                     Use a standard regular expression.  Amazon  Lex  supports
                     the following characters in the regular expression:

                     o A-Z, a-z

                     o 0-9

                     o Unicode characters ("u<Unicode>")

                     Represent  Unicode characters with four digits, for exam-
                     ple "u0041" or "u005A".

                     The following regular expression operators are  not  sup-
                     ported:

                     o Infinite repeaters:
                       *
                       , +, or {x,} with no upper bound.

                     o Wild card (.)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          regexConfiguration={pattern=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "regexConfiguration": {
                "pattern": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       name -> (string)
          The name of the slot type.

       description -> (string)
          A description of the slot type.

       enumerationValues -> (list)

          (structure)
              Each slot type can have a set of values. Each enumeration  value
              represents a value the slot type can take.

              specifies the type of crust that the pizza should have. The slot
              type could include the values

       createVersion -> (boolean)
          True if a new version of the slot type was created. If the  createV-
          ersion  field  was  not  specified in the request, the createVersion
          field is set to false in the response.

       parentSlotTypeSignature -> (string)
          The built-in slot type used as the parent of the slot type.
