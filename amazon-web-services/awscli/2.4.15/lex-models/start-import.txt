       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-import
          --payload <value>
          --resource-type <value>
          --merge-strategy <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --payload (blob)
          A zip archive in binary format. The archive should contain one file,
          a JSON file containing the resource to import. The  resource  should
          match the type specified in the resourceType field.

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies the type of resource to export. Each resource also exports
          any resources that it depends on.

          o A bot exports dependent intents.

          o An intent exports dependent slot types.

          Possible values:

          o BOT

          o INTENT

          o SLOT_TYPE

       --merge-strategy (string)
          Specifies the action that the StartImport operation should take when
          there is an existing resource with the same name.

          o FAIL_ON_CONFLICT  -  The  import operation is stopped on the first
            conflict between a resource in the import  file  and  an  existing
            resource.  The name of the resource causing the conflict is in the
            failureReason field of the response to  the  GetImport  operation.
            OVERWRITE_LATEST  - The import operation proceeds even if there is
            a conflict with an existing resource. The $LASTEST version of  the
            existing  resource  is  overwritten  with the data from the import
            file.

          Possible values:

          o OVERWRITE_LATEST

          o FAIL_ON_CONFLICT

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to add to the imported bot. You  can  only  add  tags
          when you import a bot, you can't add tags to an intent or slot type.

          (structure)
              A list of key/value pairs that identify a bot, bot alias, or bot
              channel.  Tag  keys  and  values can consist of Unicode letters,
              digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =
              + - @.

              key -> (string)
                 The  key for the tag. Keys are not case-sensitive and must be
                 unique.

              value -> (string)
                 The value associated with a key. The value may  be  an  empty
                 string but it can't be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
