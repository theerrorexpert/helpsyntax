GET-INTENT()                                                      GET-INTENT()



NAME
       get-intent -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  an intent. In addition to the intent name,
       you must specify the intent version.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the  lex:GetIntent
       action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-intent
          --name <value>
          --intent-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the intent. The name is case sensitive.

       --intent-version (string)
          The version of the intent.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the slot.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the slot.

              slotConstraint -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the slot is required or optional.

              slotType -> (string)

                 defined or one of the built-in slot types.

                 The prompt that Amazon Lex uses to elicit the slot value from
                 the user.

                 messages -> (list)
                     An  array  of  objects,  each of which provides a message
                     string and its type. You can specify the  message  string
                     in  plain  text  or  in  Speech Synthesis Markup Language
                     (SSML).

                     (structure)
                        The message object that provides the message text  and
                        its type.

                        contentType -> (string)
                            The content type of the message string.

                        content -> (string)
                            The text of the message.

                        groupNumber -> (integer)
                            Identifies  the  message  group  that  the message
                            belongs to. When a group is assigned to a message,
                            Amazon  Lex returns one message from each group in
                            the response.

                 maxAttempts -> (integer)
                     The number of times to prompt the user for information.

                 responseCard -> (string)
                     A response card. Amazon Lex uses this prompt at  runtime,
                     in  the  PostText  API  response.  It substitutes session
                     attributes  and  slot  values  for  placeholders  in  the
                     response  card. For more information, see  ex-resp-card .

              priority -> (integer)
                 Directs Amazon Lex the order in which  to  elicit  this  slot
                 value from the user. For example, if the intent has two slots
                 with priorities 1 and 2, AWS Amazon Lex first elicits a value
                 for the slot with priority 1.

                 If multiple slots share the same priority, the order in which
                 Amazon Lex elicits values is arbitrary.

              sampleUtterances -> (list)
                 If you know a specific pattern with which users might respond
                 to  an  Amazon  Lex request for a slot value, you can provide
                 those utterances to improve accuracy. This  is  optional.  In
                 most  cases,  Amazon  Lex  is  capable  of understanding user
                 utterances.

                 (string)

              responseCard -> (string)
                 A set of  possible  responses  for  the  slot  type  used  by
                 text-based  clients.  A  user  chooses  an  option  from  the
                 response card, instead of using text to reply.

              obfuscationSetting -> (string)
                 Determines whether a slot is obfuscated in conversation  logs
                 and  stored  utterances. When you obfuscate a slot, the value
                 is replaced by the slot name in curly braces ({}). For  exam-
                 ple,  if  the slot name is "full_name", obfuscated values are
                 replaced with "{full_name}". For more information,  see  Slot
                 Obfuscation .

              defaultValueSpec -> (structure)
                 A  list  of  default  values for the slot. Default values are
                 used when Amazon Lex hasn't determined a value  for  a  slot.
                 You  can  specify default values from context variables, ses-
                 sion attributes, and defined values.

                 defaultValueList -> (list)
                     The default values for a slot. You can specify more  than
                     one default. For example, you can specify a default value
                     to use  from  a  matching  context  variable,  a  session
                     attribute, or a fixed value.

                     The  default  value chosen is selected based on the order
                     that you specify them in the list. For  example,  if  you
                     specify  a  context  variable  and  a fixed value in that
                     order, Amazon Lex uses the  context  variable  if  it  is
                     available, else it uses the fixed value.

                     (structure)
                        A default value for a slot.

                        defaultValue -> (string)
                            The  default  value  for the slot. You can specify
                            one of the following:

                            o #context-name.slot-name   -   The   slot   value
                              "slot-name" in the context "context-name."

                            o {attribute}  -  The  slot  value  of the session
                              attribute "attribute."

                            o 'value' - The discrete value "value."

          An array of sample utterances configured for the intent.

          (string)

          messages -> (list)
              An array of objects, each of which provides a message string and

              Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).

              (structure)
                 The message object that provides the  message  text  and  its

                     Identifies the message group that the message belongs to.
                     When a group is assigned to a message, Amazon Lex returns
                     one message from each group in the response.

              The number of times to prompt the user for information.

          responseCard -> (string)
