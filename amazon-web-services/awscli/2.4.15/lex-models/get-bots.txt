GET-BOTS()                                                          GET-BOTS()



NAME
       get-bots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns bot information as follows:

       o If you provide the nameContains field, the response includes informa-
         tion for the $LATEST version of all  bots  whose  name  contains  the
         specified string.

       o If  you  don't  specify the nameContains field, the operation returns
         information about the $LATEST version of all of your bots.

       This operation requires permission for the lex:GetBots action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-bots is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued  in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation by providing the --no-paginate argument.   When  using  --output
       text  and  the  --query  argument  on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: bots

SYNOPSIS
            get-bots
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-contains (string)
          Substring  to match in bot names. A bot will be returned if any part
          of its name matches the substring. For example, "xyz"  matches  both
          "xyzabc" and "abcxyz."

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       bots -> (list)
          An array of botMetadata objects, with one entry for each bot.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a bot. .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the bot.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the bot.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the bot.

              lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the bot was updated. When you create a bot, the
                 creation date and last updated date are the same.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the bot was created.

              version -> (string)
                 The  version of the bot. For a new bot, the version is always
                 $LATEST .

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, it includes a  pagination  token  that
          you can specify in your next request to fetch the next page of bots.
