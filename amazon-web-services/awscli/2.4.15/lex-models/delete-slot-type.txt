DELETE-SLOT-TYPE()                                          DELETE-SLOT-TYPE()



NAME
       delete-slot-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  all  versions of the slot type, including the $LATEST version.
       To delete a specific version of the slot type, use the  DeleteSlotType-
       Version operation.

       You  can  delete a version of a slot type only if it is not referenced.
       To delete a slot type that is referred to in one or more  intents,  you
       must remove those references first.

       NOTE:
          If  you get the ResourceInUseException exception, the exception pro-
          vides an example reference that shows the intent where the slot type
          is  referenced.  To  remove  the  reference to the slot type, either
          update the intent or delete it. If you get the same  exception  when
          you  attempt  to  delete  the slot type again, repeat until the slot
          type has no references and the DeleteSlotType call is successful.

       This operation requires permission for the lex:DeleteSlotType action.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-slot-type
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the slot type. The name is case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
