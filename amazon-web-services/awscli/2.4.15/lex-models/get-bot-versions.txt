GET-BOT-VERSIONS()                                          GET-BOT-VERSIONS()



NAME
       get-bot-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about all of the versions of a bot.

       The GetBotVersions operation returns a BotMetadata object for each ver-
       sion of a bot. For example, if a bot has three numbered  versions,  the
       GetBotVersions  operation  returns  four  BotMetadata  objects  in  the
       response, one for each numbered version and one for  the  $LATEST  ver-
       sion.

       The  GetBotVersions  operation always returns at least one version, the
       $LATEST version.

       This operation requires permissions for the lex:GetBotVersions  action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-bot-versions  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: bots

SYNOPSIS
            get-bot-versions
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the bot for which versions should be returned.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       bots -> (list)
          An  array  of  BotMetadata objects, one for each numbered version of
          the bot plus one for the $LATEST version.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a bot. .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the bot.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the bot.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the bot.

              lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the bot was updated. When you create a bot, the
                 creation date and last updated date are the same.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the bot was created.

              version -> (string)
                 The  version of the bot. For a new bot, the version is always
                 $LATEST .

       nextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token for fetching the next page of  bot  versions.  If
          the response to this call is truncated, Amazon Lex returns a pagina-
          tion token in the response. To fetch  the  next  page  of  versions,
          specify the pagination token in the next request.
