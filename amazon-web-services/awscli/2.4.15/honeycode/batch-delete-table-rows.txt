BATCH-DELETE-TABLE-ROWS()                            BATCH-DELETE-TABLE-ROWS()



NAME
       batch-delete-table-rows -

DESCRIPTION
       The BatchDeleteTableRows API allows you to delete one or more rows from
       a table in a workbook. You need to specify the ids of the rows that you
       want to delete from the table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-table-rows
          --workbook-id <value>
          --table-id <value>
          --row-ids <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook where the rows are being deleted.

          If  a  workbook  with  the specified id could not be found, this API
          throws ResourceNotFoundException.

       --table-id (string)
          The ID of the table where the rows are being deleted.

          If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws
          ResourceNotFoundException.

       --row-ids (list)
          The list of row ids to delete from the table. You need to specify at
          least one row id in this list.

          Note that if one of the row ids provided in  the  request  does  not
          exist  in  the table, then the request fails and no rows are deleted
          from the table.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-request-token (string)
          The request token for performing the delete action.  Request  tokens
          help  to  identify  duplicate requests. If a call times out or fails
          due to a transient error like a failed network connection,  you  can
          retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that
          if the first call using that  request  token  is  successfully  per-
          formed, the second call will not perform the action again.

          Note  that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You can-
          not use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       workbookCursor -> (long)
          The updated workbook cursor after deleting the rows from the  table.

       failedBatchItems -> (list)
          The  list  of  row ids in the request that could not be deleted from
          the table. Each element in this list contains one row  id  from  the
          request  that  could  not  be deleted along with the reason why that
          item could not be deleted.

          (structure)
              A single item in a batch that failed  to  perform  the  intended
              action because of an error preventing it from succeeding.

              id -> (string)
                 The  id of the batch item that failed. This is the batch item
                 id  for  the  BatchCreateTableRows  and  BatchUpsertTableRows
                 operations  and  the  row id for the BatchUpdateTableRows and
                 BatchDeleteTableRows operations.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message that indicates why the batch item failed.
