INVOKE-SCREEN-AUTOMATION()                          INVOKE-SCREEN-AUTOMATION()



NAME
       invoke-screen-automation -

DESCRIPTION
       The  InvokeScreenAutomation  API allows invoking an action defined in a
       screen in a Honeycode app. The  API  allows  setting  local  variables,
       which  can  then  be  used in the automation being invoked. This allows
       automating the Honeycode app interactions to write,  update  or  delete
       data in the workbook.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            invoke-screen-automation
          --workbook-id <value>
          --app-id <value>
          --screen-id <value>
          --screen-automation-id <value>
          [--variables <value>]
          [--row-id <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook that contains the screen automation.

       --app-id (string)
          The ID of the app that contains the screen automation.

       --screen-id (string)
          The ID of the screen that contains the screen automation.

       --screen-automation-id (string)
          The ID of the automation action to be performed.

       --variables (map)
          Variables  are  specified  as a map where the key is the name of the
          variable as defined on the screen. The value is an object which cur-
          rently has only one property, rawValue, which holds the value of the
          variable to be passed to the screen.  Any  variables  defined  in  a
          screen are required to be passed in the call.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The input variables to the app to be used by the InvokeScreenAu-
              tomation action request.

              rawValue -> (string)
                 Raw value of the variable.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=rawValue=string,KeyName2=rawValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "rawValue": "string"
              }
            ...}

       --row-id (string)
          The row ID for the automation if the automation is defined inside  a
          block with source or list.

       --client-request-token (string)
          The  request  token  for  performing  the automation action. Request
          tokens help to identify duplicate requests. If a call times  out  or
          fails due to a transient error like a failed network connection, you
          can retry the call with the same request token. The service  ensures
          that if the first call using that request token is successfully per-
          formed, the second call will return the  response  of  the  previous
          call rather than performing the action again.

          Note  that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You can-
          not use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       workbookCursor -> (long)
          The updated workbook cursor after performing the automation  action.
