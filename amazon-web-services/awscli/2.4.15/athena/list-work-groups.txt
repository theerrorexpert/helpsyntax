LIST-WORK-GROUPS()                                          LIST-WORK-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-work-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists available workgroups for the account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-work-groups
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain  the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of workgroups to return in this request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list workgroups

       The following list-work-groups example lists the workgroups in the cur-
       rent account.

       Output:

          {
              "WorkGroups": [
                  {

                  },
                  {
                      "Name": "primary",
                      "State": "ENABLED",
                      "Description": "",
                      "CreationTime": 1567465222.723

OUTPUT
       WorkGroups -> (list)
          A list of  WorkGroupSummary objects that include the names, descrip-
          tions, creation times, and states for each workgroup.

          (structure)
              The  summary  information  for the workgroup, which includes its
              name, state, description, and the date and time it was  created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the workgroup.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the workgroup.

              Description -> (string)
                 The workgroup description.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The workgroup creation date and time.

              EngineVersion -> (structure)
                 The  engine version setting for all queries on the workgroup.
                 Queries on the AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality workgroup run
                 on the preview engine regardless of this setting.

                 SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                     The engine version requested by the user. Possible values
                     are determined by  the  output  of  ListEngineVersions  ,
                     including Auto. The default is Auto.

                 EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                     Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If
                     the user requests a valid engine version other than Auto,
                     the  effective  engine  version is the same as the engine
                     version that the user requested.  If  the  user  requests
                     Auto,  the  effective engine version is chosen by Athena.
                     When a request to update the engine version is made by  a
                     CreateWorkGroup  or UpdateWorkGroup operation, the Effec-
                     tiveEngineVersion field is ignored.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue  pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.
