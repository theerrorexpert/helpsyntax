TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  one or more tags to an Athena resource. A tag is a label that you
       assign to a resource. In Athena, a resource can be a workgroup or  data
       catalog.  Each  tag  consists  of  a key and an optional value, both of
       which you define. For example, you can use tags  to  categorize  Athena
       workgroups  or  data  catalogs by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a
       consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter work-
       groups  or  data  catalogs  in  your  account.  For best practices, see
       Tagging Best Practices . Tag keys can be from 1 to  128  UTF-8  Unicode
       characters,  and  tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode charac-
       ters. Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and  the
       following  characters:  +  -  =  .  _  :  /  @. Tag keys and values are
       case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource.  If  you  specify
       more than one tag, separate them by commas.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          Specifies the ARN of the Athena resource (workgroup or data catalog)
          to which tags are to be added.

       --tags (list)
          A collection of one or more tags, separated by commas, to  be  added
          to an Athena workgroup or data catalog resource.

          (structure)
              A label that you assign to a resource. In Athena, a resource can
              be a workgroup or data catalog. Each tag consists of a  key  and
              an  optional  value,  both of which you define. For example, you
              can use tags to categorize Athena workgroups or data catalogs by
              purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys
              to make it easier to search and filter workgroups or data  cata-
              logs in your account. For best practices, see Tagging Best Prac-
              tices . Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode  characters,
              and  tag  values  can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters.
              Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the
              following  characters:  + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are
              case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique  per  resource.  If  you
              specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  tag key. The tag key length is from 1 to 128 Unicode char-
                 acters in UTF-8. You  can  use  letters  and  numbers  repre-
                 sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ :
                 / @. Tag keys are  case-sensitive  and  must  be  unique  per
                 resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  tag  value.  The tag value length is from 0 to 256 Unicode
                 characters in UTF-8. You can use letters and  numbers  repre-
                 sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ :
                 / @. Tag values are case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add a tag to a resource

       The  following  tag-resource   example   adds   three   tags   to   the
       dynamo_db_catalog data catalog.

          aws athena tag-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:datacatalog/dynamo_db_catalog \
              --tags Key=Organization,Value=Retail Key=Division,Value=Mountain Key=Product_Line,Value=Shoes Key=Location,Value=Denver

       This  command  produces  no  output. To see the  result, use aws athena
       list-tags-for-resource                                   --resource-arn
       arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:datacatalog/dynamo_db_catalog.

       the Amazon Athena User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
