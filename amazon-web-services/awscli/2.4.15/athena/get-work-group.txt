GET-WORK-GROUP()                                              GET-WORK-GROUP()



NAME
       get-work-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the workgroup with the specified name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-work-group
          --work-group <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --work-group (string)
          The name of the workgroup.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To return  information about a workgroup

       The  following  get-work-group  example  returns  information about the
       AthenaAdmin workgroup.

          aws athena get-work-group \
              --work-group AthenaAdmin

       Output:

OUTPUT
       WorkGroup -> (structure)
          Information about the workgroup.

          Name -> (string)
              The workgroup name.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the workgroup: ENABLED or DISABLED.

          Configuration -> (structure)
              The  configuration of the workgroup, which includes the location
              in Amazon S3 where query results are stored, the encryption con-
              figuration,  if  any, used for query results; whether the Amazon
              CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for the workgroup; whether  work-
              group settings override client-side settings; and the data usage
              limits for the amount of data scanned per  query  or  per  work-
              group.  The workgroup settings override is specified in Enforce-
              WorkGroupConfiguration (true/false) in  the  WorkGroupConfigura-
              tion . See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration
              .

              ResultConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for the workgroup, which includes the loca-
                 tion  in  Amazon  S3  where  query results are stored and the
                 encryption option, if any, used for query results. To run the
                 query,  you must specify the query results location using one
                 of the ways: either in the workgroup using this  setting,  or
                 for individual queries (client-side), using  ResultConfigura-
                 tion$OutputLocation . If none of them is set,  Athena  issues
                 an error that no output location is provided. For more infor-
                 mation, see Query Results .

                 OutputLocation -> (string)
                     The location in Amazon S3 where your  query  results  are
                     stored,  such  as s3://path/to/query/bucket/ . To run the
                     query, you must specify the query results location  using
                     one  of  the  ways:  either  for individual queries using
                     either this setting (client-side), or in  the  workgroup,
                     using   WorkGroupConfiguration  . If none of them is set,
                     Athena issues an error that no output  location  is  pro-
                     vided. For more information, see Query Results . If work-
                     group settings override client-side  settings,  then  the
                     query  uses the settings specified for the workgroup. See
                     WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

                 EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                     If query results are encrypted in  Amazon  S3,  indicates
                     the  encryption  option  used  (for  example,  SSE-KMS or
                     CSE-KMS ) and key information. This is a client-side set-
                     ting.  If  workgroup  settings  override client-side set-
                     tings, then the query uses the  encryption  configuration
                     that  is  specified  for the workgroup, and also uses the
                     location for storing query results specified in the work-
                     group.  See   WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupCon-
                     figuration and Workgroup  Settings  Override  Client-Side
                     Settings .

                     EncryptionOption -> (string)
                        Indicates  whether  Amazon  S3  server-side encryption
                        with Amazon S3-managed  keys  (SSE-S3  ),  server-side
                        encryption   with  KMS-managed  keys  (SSE-KMS  ),  or
                        client-side encryption with KMS-managed keys (CSE-KMS)
                        is used.

                        If a query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup over-
                        rides client-side settings, then the workgroup's  set-
                        ting  for  encryption  is  used.  It specifies whether
                        query results must be encrypted, for all queries  that
                        run in this workgroup.

                     KmsKey -> (string)
                        For  SSE-KMS  and CSE-KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or
                        ID.

              EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration -> (boolean)
                 If set to "true", the settings  for  the  workgroup  override
                 client-side settings. If set to "false", client-side settings
                 are used. For more information, see Workgroup Settings  Over-
                 ride Client-Side Settings .

              PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  that the Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for
                 the workgroup.

              BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery -> (long)
                 The upper data usage limit (cutoff) for the amount of bytes a
                 single query in a workgroup is allowed to scan.

              RequesterPaysEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If  set  to  true , allows members assigned to a workgroup to
                 reference Amazon S3 Requester Pays buckets in queries. If set
                 to false , workgroup members cannot query data from Requester
                 Pays buckets, and queries that retrieve data  from  Requester
                 Pays  buckets cause an error. The default is false . For more
                 information about Requester Pays buckets, see Requester  Pays
                 Buckets  in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide
                 .

              EngineVersion -> (structure)
                 The engine version that all queries running on the  workgroup
                 use.  Queries  on  the AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality work-
                 group run on the preview engine regardless of this setting.

                 SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                     The engine version requested by the user. Possible values
                     are  determined  by  the  output  of ListEngineVersions ,
                     including Auto. The default is Auto.

                 EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                     Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If
                     the user requests a valid engine version other than Auto,
                     the effective engine version is the same  as  the  engine
                     version  that  the  user  requested. If the user requests
                     Auto, the effective engine version is chosen  by  Athena.
                     When  a request to update the engine version is made by a
                     CreateWorkGroup or UpdateWorkGroup operation, the  Effec-
                     tiveEngineVersion field is ignored.

          Description -> (string)
              The workgroup description.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the workgroup was created.
