GET-NAMED-QUERY()                                            GET-NAMED-QUERY()



NAME
       get-named-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a single query. Requires that you have access
       to the workgroup in which the query was saved.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-named-query
          --named-query-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --named-query-id (string)
          The unique ID of the query. Use  ListNamedQueries to get query  IDs.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To return a named query

       The  following  get-named-query  example  returns information about the
       query that has the specified ID.

              --named-query-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "NamedQuery": {
                  "Name": "CloudFront Logs - SFO",
                  "Description": "Shows successful GET request data for SFO",
                  "Database": "default",
                  "QueryString": "select date, location, browser, uri, status from cloudfront_logs where method = 'GET' and status = 200 and location like 'SFO%' limit 10",
                  "NamedQueryId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "WorkGroup": "AthenaAdmin"
              }
          }
