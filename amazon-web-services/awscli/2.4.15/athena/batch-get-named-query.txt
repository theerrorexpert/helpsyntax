BATCH-GET-NAMED-QUERY()                                BATCH-GET-NAMED-QUERY()



NAME
       batch-get-named-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details  of  a  single  named query or a list of up to 50
       queries, which you provide as an array of query  ID  strings.  Requires
       you  to  have  access to the workgroup in which the queries were saved.
       Use  ListNamedQueriesInput to get the list of named query  IDs  in  the
       specified  workgroup.  If information could not be retrieved for a sub-
       mitted query ID, information about the query  ID  submitted  is  listed
       under   UnprocessedNamedQueryId  .  Named  queries differ from executed
       queries. Use  BatchGetQueryExecutionInput to  get  details  about  each
       unique  query execution, and  ListQueryExecutionsInput to get a list of
       query execution IDs.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-named-query
          --named-query-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --named-query-ids (list)
          An array of query IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To return information about more than one query

       The following batch-get-named-query example returns  information  about
       the named queries that have the specified IDs.
