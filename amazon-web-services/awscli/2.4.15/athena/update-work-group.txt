SYNOPSIS
            update-work-group
          --work-group <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--configuration-updates <value>]
          [--state <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --work-group (string)
          The specified workgroup that will be updated.

       --description (string)
          The workgroup description.

       --configuration-updates (structure)
          The workgroup configuration that will be updated for the given work-
          group.

          EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration -> (boolean)
              If  set  to  "true",  the  settings  for  the workgroup override
              client-side settings. If set to "false" client-side settings are
              used.  For  more  information,  see  Workgroup Settings Override
              Client-Side Settings .

          ResultConfigurationUpdates -> (structure)
              The result configuration information about the queries  in  this
              workgroup  that  will  be  updated. Includes the updated results
              location and an updated option for encrypting query results.

              OutputLocation -> (string)
                 The location in  Amazon  S3  where  your  query  results  are
                 stored,  such as s3://path/to/query/bucket/ . For more infor-
                 mation, see Query  Results  If  workgroup  settings  override
                 client-side  settings,  then  the query uses the location for
                 the query results and the encryption configuration  that  are
                 specified  for  the  workgroup. The "workgroup settings over-
                 ride"   is   specified    in    EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration
                 (true/false)  in the WorkGroupConfiguration . See  WorkGroup-
                 Configuration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

              RemoveOutputLocation -> (boolean)
                 If set to "true",  indicates  that  the  previously-specified
                 query  results location (also known as a client-side setting)
                 for queries in this workgroup should be ignored  and  set  to
                 null. If set to "false" or not set, and a value is present in
                 the   OutputLocation   in   ResultConfigurationUpdates   (the
                 client-side  setting),  the OutputLocation in the workgroup's
                 ResultConfiguration will be updated with the new  value.  For
                 more information, see Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side
                 Settings .

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration for the query results.

                 EncryptionOption -> (string)
                     Indicates whether Amazon S3 server-side  encryption  with
                     Amazon  S3-managed keys (SSE-S3 ), server-side encryption
                     with KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS ), or client-side  encryp-
                     tion with KMS-managed keys (CSE-KMS) is used.

                     If  a  query  runs in a workgroup and the workgroup over-
                     rides client-side settings, then the workgroup's  setting
                     for  encryption  is  used.  It  specifies  whether  query
                     results must be encrypted, for all queries  that  run  in
                     this workgroup.

                 KmsKey -> (string)
                     For  SSE-KMS and CSE-KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

              RemoveEncryptionConfiguration -> (boolean)
                 If set to "true",  indicates  that  the  previously-specified
                 encryption  configuration (also known as the client-side set-
                 ting) for queries in this workgroup should be ignored and set
                 to null. If set to "false" or not set, and a value is present
                 in the EncryptionConfiguration in  ResultConfigurationUpdates
                 (the client-side setting), the EncryptionConfiguration in the
                 workgroup's ResultConfiguration will be updated with the  new
                 value.  For more information, see Workgroup Settings Override
                 Client-Side Settings .

          PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether this workgroup enables publishing  metrics  to
              Amazon CloudWatch.

          BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery -> (long)
              The  upper limit (cutoff) for the amount of bytes a single query
              in a workgroup is allowed to scan.

          RemoveBytesScannedCutoffPerQuery -> (boolean)
              Indicates that  the  data  usage  control  limit  per  query  is
              removed.  WorkGroupConfiguration$BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery

          RequesterPaysEnabled -> (boolean)
              If set to true , allows members assigned to a workgroup to spec-
              ify Amazon S3 Requester Pays buckets in queries. If set to false
              ,  workgroup members cannot query data from Requester Pays buck-
              ets, and queries that retrieve data from Requester Pays  buckets
              cause  an  error.  The  default  is false . For more information
              about Requester Pays buckets, see Requester Pays Buckets in  the
              Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide .

          EngineVersion -> (structure)
              The  engine version requested when a workgroup is updated. After
              the update, all queries on the workgroup run  on  the  requested
              engine  version.  If no value was previously set, the default is
              Auto. Queries on the AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality  workgroup
              run on the preview engine regardless of this setting.

              SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version requested by the user. Possible values are
                 determined by the output of  ListEngineVersions  ,  including
                 Auto. The default is Auto.

              EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                 Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If the
                 user requests a valid engine version  other  than  Auto,  the
                 effective  engine  version  is the same as the engine version
                 that the user requested.  If  the  user  requests  Auto,  the
                 effective  engine version is chosen by Athena. When a request
                 to update the engine version is made by a CreateWorkGroup  or
                 UpdateWorkGroup  operation,  the EffectiveEngineVersion field
                 is ignored.

       --state (string)
          The workgroup state that will be updated for the given workgroup.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a workgroup

       The following update-work-group example disables the Data_Analyst_Group
       workgroup.  Users  cannot  run  or create queries in the disabled work-
       group, but can still view metrics, data usage limit controls, workgroup
       settings, query history, and saved queries.

          aws athena update-work-group \
              --work-group Data_Analyst_Group \
              --state DISABLED

       This command produces no output. To verify the change in state, use aws
       athena get-work-group --work-group  Data_Analyst_Group  and  check  the
       State property in the output.

       For more information, see Managing Workgroups in the Amazon Athena User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
