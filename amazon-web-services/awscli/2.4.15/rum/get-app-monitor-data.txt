GET-APP-MONITOR-DATA()                                  GET-APP-MONITOR-DATA()



NAME
       get-app-monitor-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  raw performance events that RUM has collected from your
       web application, so that you can do your own processing or analysis  of
       this data.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-app-monitor-data  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Events

SYNOPSIS
            get-app-monitor-data
          [--filters <value>]
          --name <value>
          --time-range <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of structures that you can use to  filter  the  results  to
          those  that match one or more sets of key-value pairs that you spec-
          ify.

          (structure)
              A structure that defines a key and values that you  can  use  to
              filter  the  results.  The  only  performance  events  that  are
              returned are those that have values matching the ones  that  you
              specify in one of your QueryFilter structures.

              For  example,  you could specify Browser as the Name and specify
              Chrome,Firefox as the Values to  return  events  generated  only
              from those browsers.

              Specifying  Invert as the Name works as a "not equal to" filter.
              For example, specify Invert as the Name and  specify  Chrome  as
              the  value to return all events except events from user sessions
              with the Chrome browser.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of a key to search for. The filter returns only  the
                 events that match the Name and Values that you specify.

                 Valid values for Name are Browser | Device | Country | Page |
                 OS | EventType | Invert

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of the Name that are to  be  be  included  in  the
                 returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name (string)
          The name of the app monitor that collected the data that you want to
          retrieve.

       --time-range (structure)
          A structure that defines the time range that you  want  to  retrieve
          results from.

          After -> (long)
              The  beginning  of the time range to retrieve performance events
              from.

          Before -> (long)
              The end of the time range to retrieve performance  events  from.
              If  you  omit this, the time range extends to the time that this
              operation is performed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          After=long,Before=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "After": long,
            "Before": long
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Events -> (list)
          The events that RUM collected that match your request.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the
          next set of results.
