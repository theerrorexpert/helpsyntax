GET-APP-MONITOR()                                            GET-APP-MONITOR()



NAME
       get-app-monitor -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the complete configuration information for one app monitor.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-app-monitor
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The app monitor to retrieve information for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AppMonitor -> (structure)
          A structure containing all the configuration information for the app
          monitor.

          AppMonitorConfiguration -> (structure)
              A structure that contains much of the configuration data for the
              app monitor.

              AllowCookies -> (boolean)
                 If  you  set this to true , the RUM web client sets two cook-
                 ies, a session cookie and a user cookie.  The  cookies  allow
                 the  RUM web client to collect data relating to the number of
                 users an application has and the behavior of the  application
                 across  a  sequence  of  events.  Cookies  are  stored in the
                 top-level domain of the current page.

              EnableXRay -> (boolean)
                 If you set this to true , RUM enables X-Ray tracing  for  the
                 user  sessions  that  RUM  samples.  RUM  adds an X-Ray trace
                 header to allowed HTTP requests. It  also  records  an  X-Ray
                 segment  for  allowed  HTTP  requests. You can see traces and
                 segments from these user sessions in the  X-Ray  console  and
                 the CloudWatch ServiceLens console. For more information, see
                 What is X-Ray?

              ExcludedPages -> (list)
                 A list of URLs in your website or application to exclude from
                 RUM data collection.

                 You can't include both ExcludedPages and IncludedPages in the
                 same operation.

                 (string)

              FavoritePages -> (list)
                 A list of pages in the CloudWatch RUM console that are to  be
                 displayed with a "favorite" icon.

                 (string)

              GuestRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the guest IAM role that is attached to the Amazon
                 Cognito identity pool that is used to authorize  the  sending
                 of data to RUM.

              IdentityPoolId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the Amazon Cognito identity pool that is used to
                 authorize the sending of data to RUM.

              IncludedPages -> (list)
                 If this app monitor is to  collect  data  from  only  certain
                 pages  in your application, this structure lists those pages.
                     <p>You can't include both <code>ExcludedPages</code>  and
                     <code>IncludedPages</code> in the same operation.</p>

                 (string)

              SessionSampleRate -> (double)
                 Specifies the percentage of user sessions to use for RUM data
                 collection. Choosing a higher percentage gives you more  data
                 but also incurs more costs.

                 The  number  you  specify  is the percentage of user sessions
                 that will be used.

                 If you omit this parameter, the default of 10 is used.

              Telemetries -> (list)
                 An array that lists the types of telemetry data that this app
                 monitor is to collect.

                 o errors  indicates  that  RUM  collects data about unhandled
                   JavaScript errors raised by your application.

                 o performance indicates that RUM  collects  performance  data
                   about how your application and its resources are loaded and
                   rendered. This includes Core Web Vitals.

                 o http indicates that RUM collects  data  about  HTTP  errors
                   thrown by your application.

              monitor stores a copy of the telemetry data  that  RUM  collects
              using CloudWatch Logs.

              CwLog -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that contains the information about whether the
                 app monitor stores copies of the data that  RUM  collects  in
                 CloudWatch Logs. If it does, this structure also contains the
                 name of the log group.

                 CwLogEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicated whether the app monitor stores  copies  of  the
