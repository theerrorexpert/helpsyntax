SYNOPSIS
            phone-number-validate
          --number-validate-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --number-validate-request (structure)
          Specifies a phone number to validate and retrieve information about.

          IsoCountryCode -> (string)
              The two-character code, in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2  format,  for  the
              country  or  region where the phone number was originally regis-
              tered.

          PhoneNumber -> (string)
              The phone number to retrieve information about. The phone number
              that  you  provide  should include a valid numeric country code.
              Otherwise, the operation might result in an error.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IsoCountryCode=string,PhoneNumber=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IsoCountryCode": "string",
            "PhoneNumber": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
