NAME
       get-segments -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  the  configuration, dimension, and other
       settings for all the segments that are associated with an  application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-segments
          --application-id <value>
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --page-size (string)
          The maximum number of items to include in each page of  a  paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --token (string)
          The NextToken string that specifies which page of results to  return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                      key -> (string)

                                      value -> (structure)
                                          Specifies  metric-based criteria for
                                          including  or  excluding   endpoints
                                          from   a   segment.  These  criteria
                                          derive from custom metrics that  you
                                          define for endpoints.

                                          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                             The  operator to use when compar-
                                             ing metric values.  Valid  values
                                             are:   GREATER_THAN,   LESS_THAN,
                                             GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
                                             LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, and EQUAL.

                                             The value to compare.

                                   UserAttributes -> (map)
                                      One  or  more  custom user attributes to
                                      use as criteria for the segment.

                                      key -> (string)

                                      value -> (structure)

                                          for including or excluding endpoints
                                          from a segment.

                                          AttributeType -> (string)
                                             The type of segment dimension  to
                                             use. Valid values are:

                                             o INCLUSIVE - endpoints that have
                                               attributes matching the  values
                                               are included in the segment.

                                               attributes matching the  values
                                               are excluded in the segment.

                                             o CONTAINS  - endpoints that have
                                               attributes'  substrings   match
                                               the  values are included in the
                                               segment.

                                             o BEFORE   -    endpoints    with
                                               attributes  read as ISO_INSTANT
                                               datetimes before the value  are
                                               included in the segment.

                                             o AFTER    -    endpoints    with
                                               attributes read as  ISO_INSTANT
                                               datetimes  after  the value are
                                               included in the segment.

                                             o ON - endpoints with  attributes

                                               the value are included  in  the
                                               segment.  Time  is  ignored  in
                                               this comparison.

                                             o BETWEEN   -   endpoints    with

                                               are included in the segment.

                                          Values -> (list)
                                             The  criteria  values  to use for
                                             the segment dimension.  Depending
                                             on the value of the AttributeType
                                             property, endpoints are  included
                                             or  excluded  from the segment if
                                             their attribute values match  the
                                             criteria values.

                                             (string)

                            SourceSegments -> (list)
                               The  base  segment  to  build the segment on. A
                               base segment, also referred to as a source seg-
                               ment  ,  defines the initial population of end-
                               points for a segment. When you  add  dimensions
                               to  a segment, Amazon Pinpoint filters the base
                               segment by using the dimensions that you  spec-
                               ify.

                               You  can specify more than one dimensional seg-
                               ment or only one imported segment. If you spec-
                               ify  an  imported  segment, the Amazon Pinpoint
                               console displays a segment size  estimate  that
                               indicates  the  size  of  the  imported segment
                               without any filters applied to it.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies the segment identifier  and  ver-
                                   sion of a segment.

                                   Id -> (string)
                                      The unique identifier for the segment.

                                   Version -> (integer)
                                      The version number of the segment.

                            SourceType -> (string)
                               Specifies  how to handle multiple base segments
                               for the segment. For example,  if  you  specify
                               three  base  segments  for the segment, whether
                               the resulting segment is based on all, any,  or
                               none of the base segments.

                            Type -> (string)
                               Specifies how to handle multiple dimensions for
                               the segment. For example, if you specify  three
                               dimensions for the segment, whether the result-
                               ing segment includes endpoints that match  all,
                               any, or none of the dimensions.

                     Include -> (string)
                        Specifies  how  to  handle multiple segment groups for
                        the segment. For  example,  if  the  segment  includes
                        three  segment  groups,  whether the resulting segment
                        includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the
                        segment groups.

                 SegmentType -> (string)
                     The segment type. Valid values are:

                     o DIMENSIONAL  -  A  dynamic  segment, which is a segment
                       that uses selection criteria that you  specify  and  is
                       based  on  endpoint  data  that's reported by your app.
                       Dynamic segments can change over time.

                     o IMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses
                       selection  criteria  that  you  specify and is based on
                       endpoint definitions  that  you  import  from  a  file.
                       Imported  segments  are  static; they don't change over
                       time.

                 tags -> (map)
                     A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that identifies
                     the  tags  that are associated with the segment. Each tag
                     consists of a required tag  key  and  an  associated  tag
                     value.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 Version -> (integer)
                     The version number of the segment.

          NextToken -> (string)
              The  string  to use in a subsequent request to get the next page
              of results in a paginated response. This value is null if  there
              are no additional pages.
