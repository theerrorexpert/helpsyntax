SYNOPSIS
            update-adm-channel
          --adm-channel-request <value>
          --application-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --adm-channel-request (structure)
          Specifies the status and settings of the ADM (Amazon Device  Messag-
          ing) channel for an application.

          ClientId -> (string)
              The  Client ID that you received from Amazon to send messages by
              using ADM.

          ClientSecret -> (string)
              The Client Secret that you received from Amazon to send messages
              by using ADM.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether to enable the ADM channel for the application.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ClientId=string,ClientSecret=string,Enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ClientId": "string",
            "ClientSecret": "string",
            "Enabled": true|false
          }

       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
