SYNOPSIS
            update-push-template
          [--create-new-version | --no-create-new-version]
          --push-notification-template-request <value>
          --template-name <value>
          [--template-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --create-new-version | --no-create-new-version (boolean)
          Specifies whether to save the updates as a new version of  the  mes-
          sage  template.  Valid  values  are: true, save the updates as a new
          version; and, false, save the  updates  to  (overwrite)  the  latest
          existing version of the template.

          If  you  don't  specify  a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint
          saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the
          template.  If  you specify a value of true for this parameter, don't
          specify a value for the version parameter. Otherwise, an error  will
          occur.

       --push-notification-template-request (structure)

          be used in messages that are sent through a push notification  chan-

                 value  for this key is the name of a sound file in your app's
                 main bundle or the Library/Sounds folder in your  app's  data
                 container.  If  the  sound file can't be found or you specify

              key-value pairs. Each key defines a message variable in the tem-
              plate. The corresponding value defines  the  default  value  for
              that  variable.  When  you  create a message that's based on the

       --template-name (string)
          The name of the message template. A template name must start with an
          alphanumeric  character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters.
          The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores  (_),  or
          hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

       --template-version (string)
          The  unique  identifier  for  the version of the message template to
          update, retrieve information about, or delete. To  retrieve  identi-
          fiers  and other information for all the versions of a template, use
          the Template Versionsresource.

          If specified, this value must match the identifier for  an  existing
          template  version.  If specified for an update operation, this value
          must match the identifier for the latest  existing  version  of  the
          template.  This  restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't
          occur.

          If you don't specify a value for  this  parameter,  Amazon  Pinpoint
          does the following:

          o For  a  get operation, retrieves information about the active ver-
            sion of the template.

          o For an update operation, saves the  updates  to  (overwrites)  the
            latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version
            parameter isn't used or is set to false.

          o For a delete operation, deletes the template, including  all  ver-
            sions of the template.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MessageBody -> (structure)
          Provides information about an API request or response.

          Message -> (string)
              The message that's returned from the API.

          RequestID -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the request or response.
