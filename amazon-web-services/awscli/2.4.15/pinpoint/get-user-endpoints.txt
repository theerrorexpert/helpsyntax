GET-USER-ENDPOINTS()                                      GET-USER-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       get-user-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information about all the endpoints that are associated with
       a specific user ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-user-endpoints
          --application-id <value>
          --user-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --user-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the user.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointsResponse -> (structure)
          Provides  information  about  all  the endpoints that are associated
          with a user ID.

          Item -> (list)
              An array of responses, one for each endpoint  that's  associated
              with the user ID.

              (structure)
                 Provides  information  about  the channel type and other set-
                 tings for an endpoint.

                 Address -> (string)
                     The destination address for messages  or  push  notifica-
                     tions  that  you send to the endpoint. The address varies
                     by channel. For example, the address for a push-notifica-
                     tion  channel  is  typically the token provided by a push
                     notification service, such as an Apple Push  Notification
                     service (APNs) device token or a Firebase Cloud Messaging
                     (FCM) registration token. The address for the SMS channel
                     is  a phone number in E.164 format, such as +12065550100.
                     The address for the email channel is an email address.

                 ApplicationId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the application that's  associ-
                     ated with the endpoint.

                 Attributes -> (map)
                     One  or more custom attributes that describe the endpoint
                     by associating a name with an array of values. For  exam-
                     ple,  the  value  of  a  custom attribute named Interests
                     might be: ["Science", "Music",  "Travel"].  You  can  use
                     these  attributes as filter criteria when you create seg-
                     ments.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

                 ChannelType -> (string)
                     The channel that's used when  sending  messages  or  push
                     notifications to the endpoint.

                 CohortId -> (string)
                     A  number  from  0-99 that represents the cohort that the
                     endpoint is  assigned  to.  Endpoints  are  grouped  into
                     cohorts  randomly, and each cohort contains approximately
                     1 percent of the endpoints  for  an  application.  Amazon
                     Pinpoint  assigns  cohorts  to  the  holdout or treatment
                     allocations for campaigns.

                 CreationDate -> (string)
                     The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the  endpoint
                     was created.

                 Demographic -> (structure)

                        The version of the app that's associated with the end-
                        point.

                     Locale -> (string)
                        The  locale  of the endpoint, in the following format:
                        the ISO 639-1 alpha-2 code, followed by an  underscore
                        (_), followed by an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 value.

                     Make -> (string)
                        The manufacturer of the endpoint device, such as apple
                        or samsung.

                     Model -> (string)
                        The model name or number of the endpoint device,  such
                        as iPhone or SM-G900F.

                     ModelVersion -> (string)
                        The model version of the endpoint device.

                     Platform -> (string)
                        The platform of the endpoint device, such as ios.

                     PlatformVersion -> (string)
                        The platform version of the endpoint device.

                     Timezone -> (string)
                        The time zone of the endpoint, specified as a tz data-
                        base name value, such as America/Los_Angeles.

                 EffectiveDate -> (string)
                     The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the  endpoint
                     was last updated.

                 EndpointStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies whether messages or push notifications are sent
                     to the endpoint. Possible values  are:  ACTIVE,  messages
                     are  sent  to the endpoint; and, INACTIVE, messages arent
                     sent to the endpoint.

                     Amazon Pinpoint automatically sets this value  to  ACTIVE
                     when  you  create  an endpoint or update an existing end-
                     point. Amazon Pinpoint automatically sets this  value  to
                     INACTIVE if you update another endpoint that has the same
                     address specified by the Address property.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier that you assigned to the  endpoint.
                     The  identifier  should  be  a globally unique identifier
                     (GUID) to ensure that it doesn't conflict with other end-
                     point  identifiers  that are associated with the applica-
                     tion.

                 Location -> (structure)
                     The geographic information for the endpoint.

                     City -> (string)
                        The name of the city where the endpoint is located.

                     Country -> (string)
                        The two-character code, in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2  format,
                        for  the  country  or  region  where  the  endpoint is
                        located. For example, US for the United States.

                     Latitude -> (double)
                        The latitude  coordinate  of  the  endpoint  location,
                        rounded to one decimal place.

                     Longitude -> (double)
                        The  longitude  coordinate  of  the endpoint location,
                        rounded to one decimal place.

                     PostalCode -> (string)
                        The postal or ZIP code for the area where the endpoint
                        is located.

                     Region -> (string)
                        The  name of the region where the endpoint is located.
                        For locations in the United States, this value is  the
                        name of a state.

                 Metrics -> (map)
                     One  or more custom metrics that your app reports to Ama-
                     zon Pinpoint for the endpoint.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (double)

                 OptOut -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the user who's associated with the end-
                     point  has opted out of receiving messages and push noti-
                     fications from you. Possible values are:  ALL,  the  user
                     has opted out and doesn't want to receive any messages or
                     push notifications; and, NONE, the user hasn't opted  out
                     and wants to receive all messages and push notifications.

                 RequestId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for  the  most  recent  request  to
                     update the endpoint.

                 User -> (structure)
                     One  or more custom user attributes that your app reports
                     to Amazon Pinpoint for the user who's associated with the
                     endpoint.

                     UserAttributes -> (map)
                        One  or  more custom attributes that describe the user
                        by associating a name with an  array  of  values.  For
                        example,  the  value  of  an attribute named Interests
                        might be: ["Science", "Music", "Travel"]. You can  use
                        these  attributes  as  filter criteria when you create
                        segments. Attribute names are case sensitive.

                        An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters.  An
                        attribute value can contain up to 100 characters. When
                        you define the name of a custom attribute, avoid using
                        the  following characters: number sign (#), colon (:),
                        question mark (?), backslash (), and  slash  (/).  The
                        Amazon  Pinpoint console can't display attribute names
                        that  contain  these  characters.   This   restriction
                        doesn't apply to attribute values.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (list)
                            (string)

                     UserId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the user.
