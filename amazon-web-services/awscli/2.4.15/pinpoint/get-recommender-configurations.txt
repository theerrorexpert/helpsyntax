NAME
       get-recommender-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  all the recommender model configurations
       that are associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-recommender-configurations
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (string)
          The maximum number of items to include in each page of  a  paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --token (string)
          The NextToken string that specifies which page of results to  return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ListRecommenderConfigurationsResponse -> (structure)
          Provides  information about all the recommender model configurations
          that are associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account.

          Item -> (list)
              An array of responses, one for each recommender model configura-
              tion that's associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account.

              (structure)
                 Provides information about Amazon Pinpoint configuration set-
                 tings for retrieving and processing data from  a  recommender
                 model.

                 Attributes -> (map)
                     A   map   that  defines  1-10  custom  endpoint  or  user
                     attributes, depending on the value  for  the  Recommenda-
                     tionProviderIdType  property.  Each  of  these attributes
                     temporarily stores a recommended  item  that's  retrieved
                     from  the  recommender  model  and  sent to an AWS Lambda
                     function for additional processing. Each attribute can be
                     used as a message variable in a message template.

                     This value is null if the configuration doesn't invoke an
                     AWS  Lambda  function  (RecommendationTransformerUri)  to
                     perform additional processing of recommendation data.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 CreationDate -> (string)
                     The  date, in extended ISO 8601 format, when the configu-
                     ration was created for the recommender model.

                 Description -> (string)
                     The custom description of the configuration for the  rec-
                     ommender model.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  unique identifier for the recommender model configu-
                     ration.

                 LastModifiedDate -> (string)
                     The date, in extended ISO 8601 format, when the  configu-
                     ration for the recommender model was last modified.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  custom name of the configuration for the recommender
                     model.

                 RecommendationProviderIdType -> (string)
                     The type of Amazon Pinpoint  ID  that's  associated  with
                     unique  user  IDs  in  the  recommender model. This value
                     enables the model to use attribute and event  data  thats
                     specific  to  a  particular endpoint or user in an Amazon
                     Pinpoint application. Possible values are:

                     o PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID - Each user in the model is  asso-
                       ciated  with  a particular endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint.
                       The data is correlated based on endpoint IDs in  Amazon
                       Pinpoint. This is the default value.

                     o PINPOINT_USER_ID - Each user in the model is associated
                       with a particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint.
                       The data is correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pin-
                       point. If this value is specified, an endpoint  defini-
                       tion  in  Amazon Pinpoint has to specify both a user ID
                       (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise,  messages  wont
                       be sent to the user's endpoint.

                 RecommendationProviderRoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and
                     Access Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon  Pin-
                     point  to  retrieve  recommendation  data from the recom-
                     mender model.

                 RecommendationProviderUri -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  recommender  model
                     that  Amazon  Pinpoint  retrieves the recommendation data
                     from. This value is the ARN of an Amazon Personalize cam-
                     paign.

                 RecommendationTransformerUri -> (string)
                     The  name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda
                     function that Amazon Pinpoint invokes  to  perform  addi-
                     tional   processing   of   recommendation  data  that  it
                     retrieves from the recommender model.

                 RecommendationsDisplayName -> (string)
                     The custom display name for the standard endpoint or user
                     attribute  (RecommendationItems)  that temporarily stores
                     recommended items for each endpoint or user, depending on
                     the  value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property.
                     This name appears in the Attribute finder of the template
                     editor on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

                     This value is null if the configuration doesn't invoke an
                     AWS  Lambda  function  (RecommendationTransformerUri)  to
                     perform additional processing of recommendation data.

                 RecommendationsPerMessage -> (integer)
                     The  number  of recommended items that are retrieved from
                     the model for each endpoint or  user,  depending  on  the
                     value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This
                     number determines how many recommended items  are  avail-
                     able for use in message variables.

          NextToken -> (string)
              The  string  to use in a subsequent request to get the next page
              of results in a paginated response. This value is null if  there
              are no additional pages.
