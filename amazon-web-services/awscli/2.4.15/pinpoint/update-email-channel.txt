              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the identity, verified with
              Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES), that you want  to  use

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfigurationSet=string,Enabled=boolean,FromAddress=string,Identity=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfigurationSet": "string",
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "FromAddress": "string",
            "Identity": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
