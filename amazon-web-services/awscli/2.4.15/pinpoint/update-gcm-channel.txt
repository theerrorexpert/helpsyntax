NAME
       update-gcm-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  the  GCM  channel for an application or updates the status and
       settings of the GCM channel for an application.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-gcm-channel
          --application-id <value>
          --gcm-channel-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --gcm-channel-request (structure)
          Specifies the status and settings of the GCM channel for an applica-
          tion. This channel enables Amazon Pinpoint to  send  push  notifica-
          tions  through  the  Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), formerly Google
          Cloud Messaging (GCM), service.

          ApiKey -> (string)
              The Web API Key, also referred to as an API_KEY or server key  ,
              that  you  received  from Google to communicate with Google ser-
              vices.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether to enable the GCM channel for the application.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ApiKey=string,Enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ApiKey": "string",
            "Enabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GCMChannelResponse -> (structure)
          Provides  information about the status and settings of the GCM chan-
          nel for an application. The GCM channel enables Amazon  Pinpoint  to
          send  push notifications through the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM),
          formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), service.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the application that the  GCM  channel
              applies to.

          CreationDate -> (string)
              The date and time when the GCM channel was enabled.

          Credential -> (string)
              The  Web API Key, also referred to as an API_KEY or server key ,

              vices.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  GCM channel is enabled for the applica-
              tion.

          HasCredential -> (boolean)
              (Not used) This property is retained only for backward  compati-
              bility.

          Id -> (string)
