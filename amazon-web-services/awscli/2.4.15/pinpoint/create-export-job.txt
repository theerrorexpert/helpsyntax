       create-export-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an export job for an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-export-job
          --application-id <value>
          --export-job-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --export-job-request (structure)
          Specifies the settings for a job that exports  endpoint  definitions
          to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
              Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to  access
              the Amazon S3 location where you want to export endpoint defini-
              tions to.

          S3UrlPrefix -> (string)
              The URL of the location in  an  Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service
              (Amazon S3) bucket where you want to export endpoint definitions
              to. This location is typically a folder that  contains  multiple
              files.   The   URL   should   be   in   the   following  format:
              s3://bucket-name/folder-name/.

          SegmentId -> (string)
              The identifier for the segment to  export  endpoint  definitions
              from.  If  you don't specify this value, Amazon Pinpoint exports
              definitions for all the endpoints that are associated  with  the
              application.

          SegmentVersion -> (integer)
              The  version of the segment to export endpoint definitions from,
              if specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RoleArn=string,S3UrlPrefix=string,SegmentId=string,SegmentVersion=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "S3UrlPrefix": "string",
            "SegmentId": "string",
            "SegmentVersion": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExportJobResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status and settings  of  a  job  that
          exports  endpoint  definitions  to  a  file.  The  file can be added
          directly to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)  bucket  by
          using  the  Amazon Pinpoint API or downloaded directly to a computer
          by using the Amazon Pinpoint console.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the application that's associated with
              the export job.

          CompletedPieces -> (integer)
              The  number  of  pieces  that  were processed successfully (com-
              pleted) by the export job, as of the time of the request.

          CompletionDate -> (string)
              The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the export job was completed.

          CreationDate -> (string)

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
                 Management (IAM) role  that  authorized  Amazon  Pinpoint  to

              S3UrlPrefix -> (string)
                 The URL of the location in an Amazon Simple  Storage  Service
                 (Amazon  S3)  bucket  where  the  endpoint  definitions  were
                 exported to. This location is typically a  folder  that  con-
                 tains multiple files. The URL should be in the following for-
                 mat: s3://bucket-name/folder-name/.

                 The identifier for the segment that the endpoint  definitions
                 were  exported from. If this value isn't present, Amazon Pin-
                 point exported definitions for all  the  endpoints  that  are
                 associated with the application.

              SegmentVersion -> (integer)

                 exported from.

              Pinpoint wasn't able to process one or more pieces in the job.

          TotalFailures -> (integer)
              The total number of endpoint definitions that weren't  processed
              successfully  (failed)  by  the export job, typically because an
              error, such as a syntax error, occurred.

          TotalPieces -> (integer)
