DELETE-EVENT-STREAM()                                    DELETE-EVENT-STREAM()



NAME
       delete-event-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the event stream for an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-event-stream
          --application-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventStream -> (structure)
          Specifies settings for publishing event data to  an  Amazon  Kinesis
          data stream or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier for the application to publish event data
              for.

          DestinationStreamArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Kinesis data stream
              or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to publish event
              data to.

              For a Kinesis data stream,  the  ARN  format  is:  arn:aws:kine-
              sis:region:account-id:stream/stream_name

              For  a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, the ARN format is:
              arn:aws:firehose:region:account-id:deliverystream/stream_name

          ExternalId -> (string)
              (Deprecated) Your AWS account  ID,  which  you  assigned  to  an
              external  ID  key in an IAM trust policy. Amazon Pinpoint previ-
              ously used this value to assume  an  IAM  role  when  publishing
              event  data, but we removed this requirement. We don't recommend
              use of external IDs for IAM roles that  are  assumed  by  Amazon
              Pinpoint.

          LastModifiedDate -> (string)
              The  date,  in  ISO  8601 format, when the event stream was last
              modified.

          LastUpdatedBy -> (string)
              The IAM user who last modified the event stream.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role  that  autho-
              rizes  Amazon  Pinpoint  to  publish event data to the stream in
              your AWS account.
