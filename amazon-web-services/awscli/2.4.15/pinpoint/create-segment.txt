                                   that you define for endpoints.

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The operator to use when comparing  met-
                                      ric    values.    Valid    values   are:

                               criteria for the segment.

                               key -> (string)

                               value -> (structure)
                                   Specifies   attribute-based   criteria  for
                                   including or  excluding  endpoints  from  a
                                   segment.

                                   AttributeType -> (string)
                                      The  type  of  segment dimension to use.
                                      Valid values are:

                                      o INCLUSIVE  -   endpoints   that   have
                                        attributes  matching  the  values  are
                                        included in the segment.

                                      o EXCLUSIVE  -   endpoints   that   have
                                        attributes  matching  the  values  are
                                        excluded in the segment.

                                      o CONTAINS   -   endpoints   that   have
                                        attributes'  substrings match the val-
                                        ues are included in the segment.

                                      o BEFORE  -  endpoints  with  attributes
                                        read  as  ISO_INSTANT datetimes before
                                        the value are included in the segment.

                                      o AFTER - endpoints with attributes read
                                        as  ISO_INSTANT  datetimes  after  the
                                        value are included in the segment.

                                      o ON - endpoints with attributes read as
                                        ISO_INSTANT dates  on  the  value  are
                                        included   in  the  segment.  Time  is
                                        ignored in this comparison.

                                      o BETWEEN -  endpoints  with  attributes
                                        read  as ISO_INSTANT datetimes between
                                        the values are included  in  the  seg-
                                        ment.

                                   Values -> (list)
                                      The  criteria values to use for the seg-
                                      ment dimension. Depending on  the  value
                                      of the AttributeType property, endpoints
                                      are included or excluded from  the  seg-
                                      ment if their attribute values match the
                                      criteria values.

                                      (string)

                     SourceSegments -> (list)
                        The base segment to build the segment on. A base  seg-
                        ment,  also  referred to as a source segment , defines
                        the initial population of  endpoints  for  a  segment.
                        When  you add dimensions to a segment, Amazon Pinpoint
                        filters the base segment by using the dimensions  that
                        you specify.

                        You  can  specify more than one dimensional segment or
                        only one imported segment. If you specify an  imported
                        segment,  the  Amazon Pinpoint console displays a seg-
                        ment size estimate that  indicates  the  size  of  the
                        imported segment without any filters applied to it.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  the segment identifier and version of a
                            segment.

                            Id -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the segment.

                            Version -> (integer)
                               The version number of the segment.

                     SourceType -> (string)
                        Specifies how to handle multiple base segments for the
                        segment.  For  example, if you specify three base seg-
                        ments for the segment, whether the  resulting  segment
                        is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies  how  to  handle multiple dimensions for the
                        segment. For example, if you specify three  dimensions
                        for   the   segment,  whether  the  resulting  segment
                        includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the
                        dimensions.

              Include -> (string)
                 Specifies  how to handle multiple segment groups for the seg-
                 ment. For example, if  the  segment  includes  three  segment
                 groups, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that
                 match all, any, or none of the segment groups.

          tags -> (map)
              A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the  tags
              to  associate  with the segment. Each tag consists of a required
              tag key and an associated tag value.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                        attributes  matching  the  values  are
                                        excluded in the segment.

                                      o CONTAINS   -   endpoints   that   have
                                        attributes'  substrings match the val-
                                        ues are included in the segment.

                                      o BEFORE  -  endpoints  with  attributes
                                        read  as  ISO_INSTANT datetimes before

                                      ment dimension. Depending on  the  value
                                      of the AttributeType property, endpoints
                                      are included or excluded from  the  seg-
                                      ment if their attribute values match the
                                      criteria values.

                                      (string)

                     SourceSegments -> (list)
                        The base segment to build the segment on. A base  seg-
                        ment,  also  referred to as a source segment , defines
                        the initial population of  endpoints  for  a  segment.
                        When  you add dimensions to a segment, Amazon Pinpoint
                        filters the base segment by using the dimensions  that
                        you specify.

                        You  can  specify more than one dimensional segment or
                        only one imported segment. If you specify an  imported
                        segment,  the  Amazon Pinpoint console displays a seg-
                        ment size estimate that  indicates  the  size  of  the
                        imported segment without any filters applied to it.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  the segment identifier and version of a
                            segment.

                            Id -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the segment.

                            Version -> (integer)
                               The version number of the segment.

                     SourceType -> (string)
                        Specifies how to handle multiple base segments for the
                        segment.  For  example, if you specify three base seg-
                        ments for the segment, whether the  resulting  segment
                        is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies  how  to  handle multiple dimensions for the
                        segment. For example, if you specify three  dimensions
                        for   the   segment,  whether  the  resulting  segment
                        includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the
                        dimensions.

              Include -> (string)
                 Specifies  how to handle multiple segment groups for the seg-
                 ment. For example, if  the  segment  includes  three  segment
                 groups, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that
                 match all, any, or none of the segment groups.

          SegmentType -> (string)
              The segment type. Valid values are:

              o DIMENSIONAL - A dynamic segment, which is a segment that  uses
                selection  criteria  that you specify and is based on endpoint
                data that's reported by your app. Dynamic segments can  change
                over time.

              o IMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses selec-
                tion criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint  defi-
                nitions  that  you  import  from a file. Imported segments are
                static; they don't change over time.

          tags -> (map)
              A string-to-string map of key-value pairs  that  identifies  the
              tags  that are associated with the segment. Each tag consists of
              a required tag key and an associated tag value.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          Version -> (integer)
              The version number of the segment.
