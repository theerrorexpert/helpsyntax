NAME
       get-application-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about the settings for an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-application-settings
          --application-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationSettingsResource -> (structure)
          Provides information about an  application,  including  the  default
          settings for an application.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  for the application. This identifier is
              displayed as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

          CampaignHook -> (structure)
              The settings for the AWS Lambda function to invoke by default as
              a  code  hook for campaigns in the application. You can use this
              hook to customize segments that are used  by  campaigns  in  the
              application.

              LambdaFunctionName -> (string)
                 The  name  or  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda
                 function that Amazon Pinpoint invokes to customize a  segment
                 for a campaign.

              Mode -> (string)
                 The  mode  that Amazon Pinpoint uses to invoke the AWS Lambda
                 function. Possible values are:

                 o FILTER - Invoke  the  function  to  customize  the  segment
                   that's used by a campaign.

                 o DELIVERY - (Deprecated) Previously, invoked the function to
                   send a campaign through a custom channel. This  functional-
                   ity  is not supported anymore. To send a campaign through a
                   custom channel,  use  the  CustomDeliveryConfiguration  and
                   CampaignCustomMessage objects of the campaign.

              WebUrl -> (string)
                 The  web  URL  that  Amazon  Pinpoint calls to invoke the AWS
                 Lambda function over HTTPS.

          LastModifiedDate -> (string)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 format,  when  the  application's
              settings were last modified.

          Limits -> (structure)
              The default sending limits for campaigns in the application.

              Daily -> (integer)
                 The  maximum number of messages that a campaign can send to a
                 single endpoint during a 24-hour period. For an  application,
                 this value specifies the default limit for the number of mes-
                 sages that campaigns and journeys can send to a  single  end-
                 point during a 24-hour period. The maximum value is 100.

              MaximumDuration -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  amount of time, in seconds, that a campaign can
                 attempt to deliver a message after the scheduled  start  time
                 for the campaign. The minimum value is 60 seconds.

              MessagesPerSecond -> (integer)
                 The  maximum number of messages that a campaign can send each
                 second. For an application, this value specifies the  default
                 limit for the number of messages that campaigns can send each
                 second. The minimum value is 50. The maximum value is 20,000.

              Total -> (integer)
                 The  maximum number of messages that a campaign can send to a
                 single endpoint during the course of the campaign. If a  cam-
                 paign  recurs,  this  setting applies to all runs of the cam-
                 paign. The maximum value is 100.

              Session -> (integer)
                 The maximum total number of messages that  the  campaign  can
                 send per user session.

          QuietTime -> (structure)
              The  default  quiet time for campaigns in the application. Quiet
              time is a specific time range when messages aren't sent to  end-
              points, if all the following conditions are met:

              o The  EndpointDemographic.Timezone  property of the endpoint is
                set to a valid value.

              o The current time in the endpoint's time zone is later than  or
                equal  to  the  time specified by the QuietTime.Start property
                for the application (or a campaign or journey that has  custom
                quiet time settings).

              o The  current  time in the endpoint's time zone is earlier than
                or equal to the time specified by the  QuietTime.End  property
                for  the application (or a campaign or journey that has custom
                quiet time settings).

              If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, the endpoint  will
              receive  messages from a campaign or journey, even if quiet time
              is enabled.

              End -> (string)
                 The specific time when quiet time ends. This value has to use
                 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH is the hour
                 (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM is  the  minutes.
                 For example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to rep-
                 resent 2:30 PM.

              Start -> (string)
                 The specific time when quiet time begins. This value  has  to
                 use  24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH is the
                 hour (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM is the  min-
                 utes.  For  example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30
                 to represent 2:30 PM.
