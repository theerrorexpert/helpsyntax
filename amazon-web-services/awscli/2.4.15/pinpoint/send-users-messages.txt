SYNOPSIS
            send-users-messages
          --application-id <value>
          --send-users-message-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --send-users-message-request (structure)
          Specifies the configuration and other settings for a message to send
          to all the endpoints that are associated with a list of users.

          Context -> (map)
              A  map of custom attribute-value pairs. For a push notification,
              Amazon Pinpoint  adds  these  attributes  to  the  data.pinpoint
              object  in the body of the notification payload. Amazon Pinpoint
              also provides these attributes in the events that  it  generates
              for users-messages deliveries.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          MessageConfiguration -> (structure)
              The settings and content for the default message and any default
              messages that you defined for specific channels.

              ADMMessage -> (structure)
                 The default push notification message  for  the  ADM  (Amazon
                 Device Messaging) channel. This message overrides the default
                 push notification message (DefaultPushNotificationMessage).

                 Action -> (string)
                     The action to occur if the recipient taps the push  noti-
                     fication. Valid values are:

                     o OPEN_APP  - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground
                       app if it was sent  to  the  background.  This  is  the
                       default action.

                     o DEEP_LINK  -  Your  app opens and displays a designated
                       user  interface  in  the  app.  This  action  uses  the
                       deep-linking features of the Android platform.

                     o URL  -  The  default  mobile browser on the recipient's
                       device opens and loads the web page at a URL  that  you
                       specify.

                 Body -> (string)
                     The body of the notification message.

                 ConsolidationKey -> (string)
                     An arbitrary string that indicates that multiple messages
                     are logically the same and that Amazon  Device  Messaging
                     (ADM)  can  drop previously enqueued messages in favor of
                     this message.

                 Data -> (map)
                     The JSON data payload to use for the  push  notification,
                     if  the  notification is a silent push notification. This
                     payload is added to the data.pinpoint.jsonBody object  of
                     the notification.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 ExpiresAfter -> (string)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, that ADM should store the
                     message if the recipient's device is offline. Amazon Pin-
                     point  specifies this value in the expiresAfter parameter
                     when it sends the notification message to ADM.

                 IconReference -> (string)
                     The icon image name of the asset saved in your app.

                 ImageIconUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of the large icon image to display in the content
                     view of the push notification.

                 ImageUrl -> (string)
                     The  URL of an image to display in the push notification.

                 MD5 -> (string)
                     The base64-encoded, MD5 checksum of the  value  specified
                     by  the  Data  property. ADM uses the MD5 value to verify
                     the integrity of the data.

                 RawContent -> (string)
                     The raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload  for
                     the  notification message. If specified, this value over-
                     rides all other content for the message.

                 SilentPush -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the notification is a silent push noti-
                     fication,  which is a push notification that doesn't dis-
                     play on a recipient's device. Silent  push  notifications
                     can  be used for cases such as updating an app's configu-
                     ration or supporting phone home functionality.

                 SmallImageIconUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of the small icon image to display in the  status
                     bar and the content view of the push notification.

                 Sound -> (string)
                     The  sound  to  play when the recipient receives the push
                     notification. You can use the default stream  or  specify
                     the  file name of a sound resource that's bundled in your
                     app. On an Android platform, the sound file  must  reside
                     in /res/raw/.

                 Substitutions -> (map)
                     The  default message variables to use in the notification
                     message. You can  override  the  default  variables  with
                     individual address variables.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

                 Title -> (string)
                     The  title  to  display above the notification message on
                     the recipient's device.

                 Url -> (string)
                     The  URL  to  open  in  the  recipient's  default  mobile
                     browser,  if  a  recipient taps the push notification and
                     the value of the Action property is URL.

              APNSMessage -> (structure)
                 The default push notification message  for  the  APNs  (Apple
                 Push  Notification  service)  channel. This message overrides
                 the default push notification  message  (DefaultPushNotifica-
                 tionMessage).

                 APNSPushType -> (string)
                     The type of push notification to send. Valid values are:

                     o alert - For a standard notification that's displayed on
                       recipients' devices and prompts a recipient to interact
                       with the notification.

                     o background  -  For  a silent notification that delivers
                       content in the background and isn't displayed on recip-
                       ients' devices.

                     o complication  - For a notification that contains update
                       information for an apps complication timeline.

                     o fileprovider - For a notification that signals  changes
                       to a File Provider extension.

                     o mdm  - For a notification that tells managed devices to
                       contact the MDM server.

                     o voip - For a  notification  that  provides  information
                       about an incoming VoIP call.

                     Amazon    Pinpoint    specifies   this   value   in   the
                     apns-push-type request header when it sends the notifica-
                     tion  message  to  APNs. If you don't specify a value for
                     this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value to alert or
                     background  automatically,  based  on  the value that you
                     specify for the SilentPush or RawContent property of  the
                     message.

                     For  more  information  about  the apns-push-type request
                     header, see Sending Notification Requests to APNs on  the
                     Apple Developer website.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The  action to occur if the recipient taps the push noti-
                     fication. Valid values are:

                     o OPEN_APP - Your app opens or it becomes the  foreground
                       app  if  it  was  sent  to  the background. This is the
                       default action.

                     o DEEP_LINK - Your app opens and  displays  a  designated
                       user  interface  in  the  app.  This  setting  uses the
                       deep-linking features of the iOS platform.

                     o URL - The default mobile  browser  on  the  recipient's
                       device  opens  and loads the web page at a URL that you
                       specify.

                 Badge -> (integer)
                     The key that indicates whether  and  how  to  modify  the
                     badge  of your app's icon when the recipient receives the
                     push notification. If this key isn't included in the dic-
                     tionary,  the  badge doesn't change. To remove the badge,
                     set this value to 0.

                 Body -> (string)
                     The body of the notification message.

                 Category -> (string)
                     The key that indicates the notification type for the push
                     notification.  This  key is a value that's defined by the
                     identifier property of one of your app's registered cate-
                     gories.

                 CollapseId -> (string)
                     An  arbitrary  identifier  that,  if assigned to multiple
                     messages, APNs uses to coalesce the messages into a  sin-
                     gle  push notification instead of delivering each message
                     individually. This value can't exceed 64 bytes.

                     Amazon Pinpoint specifies this  value  in  the  apns-col-
                     lapse-id  request  header  when it sends the notification
                     message to APNs.

                 Data -> (map)
                     The JSON payload to use for a silent  push  notification.
                     This  payload  is  added  to  the  data.pinpoint.jsonBody
                     object of the notification.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 MediaUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of an image or video to display in the push noti-
                     fication.

                 PreferredAuthenticationMethod -> (string)
                     The  authentication  method that you want Amazon Pinpoint
                     to use when  authenticating  with  APNs,  CERTIFICATE  or
                     TOKEN.

                 Priority -> (string)
                     para>5 - Low priority, the notification might be delayed,
                     delivered as part of a group, or throttled.

                     /listitem> * 10 - High priority, the notification is sent
                     immediately.  This  is the default value. A high priority
                     notification should trigger an alert, play  a  sound,  or
                     badge your app's icon on the recipient's device.  /para>

                     Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-priority
                     request header when it sends the notification message  to
                     APNs.

                     The equivalent values for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM),
                     formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), are normal, for 5,
                     and  high,  for  10. If you specify an FCM value for this
                     property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the  value
                     to the corresponding APNs value.

                 RawContent -> (string)
                     The  raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for
                     the notification message. If specified, this value  over-
                     rides all other content for the message.

                     NOTE:
                        If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notifi-
                        cation, the message payload has to  include  the  con-
                        tent-available key. The value of the content-available
                        key has to be an integer, and can only be 0 or  1.  If
                        you're  sending a standard notification, set the value
                        of content-available to 0. If you're sending a  silent
                        (background)  notification,  set  the  value  of  con-
                        tent-available to 1. Additionally, silent notification
                        payloads  can't  include  the  alert,  badge, or sound
                        keys. For more information, see  Generating  a  Remote
                        Notification  and  Pushing  Background Updates to Your
                        App on the Apple Developer website.

                 SilentPush -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the notification is a silent push noti-
                     fication.  A  silent  (or  background)  push notification
                     isn't displayed  on  recipients'  devices.  You  can  use
                     silent  push  notifications to make small updates to your
                     app, or to display messages in an in-app message  center.

                     Amazon  Pinpoint uses this property to determine the cor-
                     rect value for the apns-push-type request header when  it
                     sends  the notification message to APNs. If you specify a
                     value of true for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the
                     value  for the apns-push-type header field to background.

                     NOTE:
                        If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notifi-
                        cation,  the  message  payload has to include the con-
                        tent-available key. For silent (background)  notifica-
                        tions,  set the value of content-available to 1. Addi-
                        tionally, the message payload for a  silent  notifica-
                        tion  can't  include  the alert, badge, or sound keys.
                        For more information, see Generating a Remote  Notifi-
                        cation  and  Pushing Background Updates to Your App on
                        the Apple Developer website.

                        Apple has indicated that they  will  throttle  "exces-
                        sive"  background notifications based on current traf-
                        fic  volumes.  To  prevent  your  notifications  being
                        throttled, Apple recommends that you send no more than
                        3 silent push  notifications  to  each  recipient  per
                        hour.

                 Sound -> (string)
                     The key for the sound to play when the recipient receives
                     the push notification. The value for this key is the name
                     of  a  sound  file  in  your  app's  main  bundle  or the
                     Library/Sounds folder in your app's  data  container.  If
                     the  sound file can't be found or you specify default for
                     the value, the system plays the default alert sound.

                 Substitutions -> (map)
                     The default message variables to use in the  notification
                     message.  You  can  override these default variables with
                     individual address variables.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

                 ThreadId -> (string)
                     The key that represents your app-specific identifier  for
                     grouping  notifications.  If  you  provide a Notification

                     and attempt to deliver the push notification, if the ser-
                     vice  is  unable  to  deliver  the notification the first
                     time. If this value is 0, APNs treats the notification as

                     or try to deliver the notification again.

                     Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the  apns-expira-

                        We recommend using plain text format for email clients
                        that  don't  render  HTML content and clients that are
                        connected to high-latency  networks,  such  as  mobile

                       app if it was sent  to  the  background.  This  is  the
                       default action.

                     o DEEP_LINK  -  Your  app opens and displays a designated
                       user  interface  in  the  app.  This  action  uses  the

                     An  arbitrary  string that identifies a group of messages
                     that can be collapsed to ensure that only the  last  mes-
                     sage  is  sent when delivery can resume. This helps avoid
                     sending too many instances of the same messages when  the
                     recipient's  device comes online again or becomes active.

                     Amazon Pinpoint specifies  this  value  in  the  Firebase
                     Cloud  Messaging  (FCM)  collapse_key  parameter  when it
                     sends the notification message to FCM.

                 Data -> (map)
                     The JSON data payload to use for the  push  notification,
                     if  the  notification is a silent push notification. This
                     payload is added to the data.pinpoint.jsonBody object  of
                     the notification.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 IconReference -> (string)

                     view of the push notification.

                 ImageUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of an image to display in the push  notification.

                 Priority -> (string)
                     para>normal - The notification might be delayed. Delivery
                     is optimized for battery usage on the recipient's device.
                     Use this value unless immediate delivery is required.

                     /listitem>  * high - The notification is sent immediately
                     and might wake a sleeping device.  /para>

                     Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the FCM  priority
                     parameter  when it sends the notification message to FCM.

                     The equivalent values for Apple Push Notification service
                     (APNs)  are 5, for normal, and 10, for high. If you spec-
                     ify an APNs value  for  this  property,  Amazon  Pinpoint
                     accepts  and  converts the value to the corresponding FCM
                     value.

                     Specifies whether the notification is a silent push noti-
                     fication,  which is a push notification that doesn't dis-
                     play on a recipient's device. Silent  push  notifications
                     can  be used for cases such as updating an app's configu-
                     ration or supporting phone home functionality.

                     individual address variables.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

                 TimeToLive -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, that FCM should store and
                     attempt to deliver the push notification, if the  service
                     is  unable to deliver the notification the first time. If
                     you don't specify this value, FCM defaults to the maximum
                     value, which is 2,419,200 seconds (28 days).

                     Amazon   Pinpoint   specifies   this  value  in  the  FCM
                     time_to_live parameter when  it  sends  the  notification
                     message to FCM.

                     aren't critical or time-sensitive, such as marketing mes-
                     sages).

                 OriginationNumber -> (string)
                     The number to send  the  SMS  message  from.  This  value
                     should be one of the dedicated long or short codes that's
                     assigned to your AWS account. If you don't specify a long
                     or short code, Amazon Pinpoint assigns a random long code
                     to the SMS message and sends the message from that  code.

                     The  long code to send the voice message from. This value
                     should be one of the dedicated long codes that's assigned
                     to  your AWS account. Although it isn't required, we rec-
                     ommend that you specify the long code  in  E.164  format,
                     for  example  +12065550100, to ensure prompt and accurate
                     delivery of the message.

                     If  you  don't  specify a value for this property, Amazon
                     Pinpoint uses the active version  of  the  template.  The
                     active  version  is  typically  the version of a template
                     that's been most recently reviewed and approved for  use,
                     depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily the lat-

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SendUsersMessageResponse -> (structure)
          Provides  information  about which users and endpoints a message was
          sent to.

          ApplicationId -> (string)

          Result -> (map)
              An object that indicates which endpoints the  message  was  sent
              to,  for each user. The object lists user IDs and, for each user
              ID, provides the endpoint IDs that the message was sent to.  For
              each endpoint ID, it provides an EndpointMessageResult object.
