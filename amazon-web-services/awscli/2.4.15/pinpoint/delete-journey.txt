NAME
       delete-journey -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a journey from an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-journey
          --application-id <value>
          --journey-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --journey-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the journey.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JourneyResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status, configuration, and other set-
          tings for a journey.

          Activities -> (map)
              A  map  that  contains a set of Activity objects, one object for
              each activity in the journey. For each Activity object, the  key
              is  the unique identifier (string) for an activity and the value
              is the settings for the activity.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Specifies the configuration and other settings for an  activ-
                 ity in a journey.

                 CUSTOM -> (structure)
                     The  settings for a custom message activity. This type of
                     activity calls an AWS Lambda function or  web  hook  that
                     sends messages to participants.

                     DeliveryUri -> (string)
                        The  destination to send the campaign or treatment to.
                        This value can be one of the following:

                        o The name or Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  an  AWS
                          Lambda  function to invoke to handle delivery of the
                          campaign or treatment.

                        o The URL for a web application or service  that  sup-
                          ports HTTPS and can receive the message. The URL has
                          to be a full URL, including the HTTPS protocol.

                     EndpointTypes -> (list)
                        The types of endpoints to send the custom message  to.
                        Each  valid  value  maps to a type of channel that you
                        can associate with an endpoint by using  the  Channel-
                        Type property of an endpoint.

                        (string)

                     MessageConfig -> (structure)
                        Specifies  the message data included in a custom chan-
                        nel message that's sent to participants in a  journey.

                        Data -> (string)
                            The message content that's passed to an AWS Lambda
                            function or to a web hook.

                     NextActivity -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the next  activity  to  per-
                        form, after Amazon Pinpoint calls the AWS Lambda func-
                        tion or web hook.

                     TemplateName -> (string)
                        The name of the custom message template to use for the
                        message.  If specified, this value must match the name
                        of an existing message template.

                     TemplateVersion -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the version of  the  message
                        template  to  use  for the message. If specified, this
                        value must match the identifier for an  existing  tem-
                        plate version. To retrieve a list of versions and ver-
                        sion identifiers for a template, use the Template Ver-
                        sionsresource.

                        If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon
                        Pinpoint uses the active version of the template.  The
                        active  version is typically the version of a template
                        that's been most recently reviewed  and  approved  for
                        use,  depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily
                        the latest version of a template.

                 ConditionalSplit -> (structure)
                     The settings for a yes/no split activity.  This  type  of
                     activity  sends  participants  down one of two paths in a
                     journey, based on conditions that you specify.

                     Condition -> (structure)
                        The conditions that define the paths for the activity,
                        and the relationship between the conditions.

                        Conditions -> (list)
                            The conditions to evaluate for the activity.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies a condition to evaluate for an activ-
                               ity in a journey.

                               EventCondition -> (structure)
                                   The dimension settings for the event that's
                                   associated with the activity.

                                   Dimensions -> (structure)
                                      The  dimensions  for the event filter to
                                      use for the activity.

                                      Attributes -> (map)
                                          One or more custom  attributes  that
                                          your  application  reports to Amazon
                                          Pinpoint.   You   can   use    these
                                          attributes   as  selection  criteria
                                          when you create an event filter.

                                          key -> (string)

                                          value -> (structure)
                                             Specifies attribute-based  crite-
                                             ria  for  including  or excluding
                                             endpoints from a segment.

                                             AttributeType -> (string)
                                                 The type of segment dimension

                                          this can  also  be  a  custom  event
                                          that's specific to your application.

                        The amount of time to wait before determining  whether
                        the conditions are met, or the date and time when Ama-
                        zon Pinpoint determines  whether  the  conditions  are
                        met.

                        WaitFor -> (string)
                            The  amount  of time to wait, as a duration in ISO
                            8601 format, before determining whether the activ-
                            ity's  conditions have been met or moving partici-

                        The unique identifier for the activity to  perform  if
                        the conditions are met.

                 Description -> (string)
                     The custom description of the activity.

                 EMAIL -> (structure)
                     The settings for an email activity. This type of activity
                     sends an email message to participants.

                     MessageConfig -> (structure)
                        Specifies the sender  address  for  an  email  message
                        that's sent to participants in the journey.

                        The unique identifier for the next  activity  to  per-
                        form, after the message is sent.

                     TemplateName -> (string)
                        The  name of the email message template to use for the
                        message. If specified, this value must match the  name
                        of an existing message template.

                     TemplateVersion -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier  for  the version of the email
                        template to use for the message.  If  specified,  this
                        value  must  match the identifier for an existing tem-
                        plate version. To retrieve a list of versions and ver-
                        sion identifiers for a template, use the Template Ver-
                        sionsresource.

                        If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon
                        Pinpoint  uses the active version of the template. The
                        active version is typically the version of a  template
                        that's  been  most  recently reviewed and approved for
                        use, depending on your workflow. It isn't  necessarily
                        the latest version of a template.

                 Holdout -> (structure)
                     The  settings for a holdout activity. This type of activ-
                     ity stops a journey for a specified percentage of partic-
                     ipants.

                     NextActivity -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier  for the next activity to per-
                        form, after performing the holdout activity.

                     Percentage -> (integer)
                        The percentage of participants who shouldn't  continue
                        the journey.

                        To  determine  which participants are held out, Amazon
                        Pinpoint applies a probability-based algorithm to  the
                        percentage  that  you  specify.  Therefore, the actual
                        percentage of participants who are held out may not be
                        equal to the percentage that you specify.

                 MultiCondition -> (structure)
                     The settings for a multivariate split activity. This type
                     of activity sends participants down one  of  as  many  as
                     five  paths (including a default Else path) in a journey,
                     based on conditions that you specify.

                     Branches -> (list)
                        The paths for the activity, including  the  conditions
                        for entering each path and the activity to perform for
                        each path.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a condition to evaluate for an  activity
                            path in a journey.

                            Condition -> (structure)
                               The  condition  to  evaluate  for  the activity
                               path.

                               EventCondition -> (structure)

                                      Attributes -> (map)
                                          One or more custom  attributes  that
                                          your  application  reports to Amazon
                                          Pinpoint.   You   can   use    these
                                          attributes   as  selection  criteria
                                          when you create an event filter.

                                             Specifies attribute-based  crite-
                                             ria  for  including  or excluding
                                             endpoints from a segment.

                                             AttributeType -> (string)
                                                 The type of segment dimension
                                                 to use. Valid values are:

                                          point.  You can use these metrics as
                                          selection criteria when  you  create

                                             or excluded from the  segment  if
                                             their  attribute values match the
                                             criteria values.

                                             (string)

                     EvaluationWaitTime -> (structure)
                        The amount of time to wait or the date and  time  when
                        Amazon  Pinpoint determines whether the conditions are
                        met.

                        WaitFor -> (string)
                            The amount of time to wait, as a duration  in  ISO
                            8601 format, before determining whether the activ-

                            pants to the next activity in the journey.

                        WaitUntil -> (string)
                            The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when Amazon
                            Pinpoint determines whether the activity's  condi-
                            tions have been met or the activity moves partici-
                            pants to the next activity in the journey.

                 PUSH -> (structure)
                     The settings for a push notification activity. This  type
                     of activity sends a push notification to participants.

                     MessageConfig -> (structure)
                        Specifies  the time to live (TTL) value for push noti-
                        fications that are sent to participants in a  journey.

                        TimeToLive -> (string)
                            The  number  of seconds that the push notification
                            service should keep the message, if the service is
                            unable to deliver the notification the first time.
                            This value is converted  to  an  expiration  value
                            when  it's sent to a push-notification service. If
                            this value is 0, the service treats the  notifica-
                            tion  as if it expires immediately and the service
                            doesn't store or try to deliver  the  notification
                            again.

                            This value doesn't apply to messages that are sent
                            through the Amazon Device Messaging (ADM) service.

                     NextActivity -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier  for the next activity to per-
                        form, after the message is sent.

                     TemplateName -> (string)
                        The name of the push notification template to use  for
                        the  message.  If specified, this value must match the
                        name of an existing message template.

                     TemplateVersion -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for  the  version  of  the  push
                        notification template to use for the message. If spec-
                        ified, this value must match  the  identifier  for  an
                        existing  template version. To retrieve a list of ver-
                        sions and version identifiers for a template, use  the
                        Template Versionsresource.

                        If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon
                        Pinpoint uses the active version of the template.  The
                        active  version is typically the version of a template
                        that's been most recently reviewed  and  approved  for
                        use,  depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily
                        the latest version of a template.

                 RandomSplit -> (structure)
                     The settings for a random split activity.  This  type  of
                     activity randomly sends specified percentages of partici-
                     pants down one of as many as five  paths  in  a  journey,
                     based on conditions that you specify.

                     Branches -> (list)
                        The  paths  for the activity, including the percentage
                        of participants to enter each path and the activity to
                        perform for each path.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  the  settings  for  a  path in a random
                            split activity in a journey.

                            NextActivity -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the next activity  to
                               perform,  after completing the activity for the
                               path.

                            Percentage -> (integer)
                               The percentage of participants to send down the
                               activity path.

                               To  determine  which participants are sent down
                               each path, Amazon Pinpoint applies a  probabil-
                               ity-based algorithm to the percentages that you
                               specify for the paths.  Therefore,  the  actual
                               percentage  of participants who are sent down a
                               path may not be equal to  the  percentage  that
                               you specify.

                 SMS -> (structure)
                     The  settings  for an SMS activity. This type of activity
                     sends a text message to participants.

                     MessageConfig -> (structure)
                        Specifies the sender ID and message type  for  an  SMS
                        message that's sent to participants in a journey.

                            The  SMS  message  type. Valid values are TRANSAC-
                            TIONAL  (for  messages  that   are   critical   or
                            time-sensitive,  such as a one-time passwords) and
                            PROMOTIONAL (for messsages that aren't critical or
                            time-sensitive, such as marketing messages).

                        OriginationNumber -> (string)
                            The  long  code to send the SMS message from. This
                            value should be one of the  dedicated  long  codes
                            that's  assigned  to your AWS account. Although it
                            isn't required, we recommend that you specify  the
                            long  code  using an E.164 format to ensure prompt
                            and accurate delivery of the message. For example,
                            +12065550100.

                        If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon
                        Pinpoint  uses the active version of the template. The
                        active version is typically the version of a  template
                        that's  been  most  recently reviewed and approved for
                        use, depending on your workflow. It isn't  necessarily

                 The maximum number of messages that the journey can send to a
                 single participant during a 24-hour period. The maximum value
                 is 100.

              EndpointReentryCap -> (integer)
                 The  maximum number of times that a participant can enter the
                 journey. The maximum value is 100. To allow  participants  to
                 enter  the  journey  an  unlimited  number of times, set this
                 value to 0.

              MessagesPerSecond -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of messages that the journey can send each
                 second.

                 Minimum time that must pass before an endpoint can re-enter a
                 given journey. The duration should use an  ISO  8601  format,
                 such as PT1H.

          LocalTime -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  journey's scheduled start and end times
              use each participant's local time. If this value  is  true,  the

              The name of the journey.

          QuietTime -> (structure)
              The  quiet  time  settings for the journey. Quiet time is a spe-
              cific time range when a journey doesn't send messages to partic-
              ipants, if all the following conditions are met:

              o The  EndpointDemographic.Timezone property of the endpoint for
                the participant is set to a valid value.

              o The current time in the participant's time zone is later  than
                or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.Start property
                for the journey.

              o The current time in the participant's  time  zone  is  earlier
                than or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.End prop-
                erty for the journey.

              If any of the preceding conditions isn't  met,  the  participant
              will  receive  messages  from the journey, even if quiet time is
              enabled.

              End -> (string)
                 The specific time when quiet time ends. This value has to use
                 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH is the hour
                 (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM is  the  minutes.
                 For example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to rep-
                 resent 2:30 PM.

              Start -> (string)
                 The specific time when quiet time begins. This value  has  to
                 use  24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH is the
                 hour (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM is the  min-
                 utes.  For  example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30
                 to represent 2:30 PM.

          RefreshFrequency -> (string)

                 ended or will end.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The scheduled time, in ISO  8601  format,  when  the  journey
                 began or will begin.

              Timezone -> (string)
                 The  starting  UTC  offset  for  the journey schedule, if the

                        The  dimensions  for  the  event filter to use for the
                        campaign or the journey activity.

                        Attributes -> (map)
                            One or more custom attributes that  your  applica-
                            tion reports to Amazon Pinpoint. You can use these
                            attributes as selection criteria when  you  create
                            an event filter.

                                     are included in the segment.

                                   o AFTER - endpoints with attributes read as
                                     ISO_INSTANT datetimes after the value are

                            This  can be a standard event that Amazon Pinpoint
                            generates,  such  as  _email.delivered.  For  cam-
                            paigns,  this  can  also  be a custom event that's
                            specific  to  your  application.  For  information
                            about  standard  events, see Streaming Amazon Pin-
                            point Events  in  the  Amazon  Pinpoint  Developer

                               dimension. Depending on the value of the Dimen-
                               sionType  property,  endpoints  are included or
                               excluded from the segment if their values match
                               the criteria values.

                ing on the journey's schedule, the journey  may  currently  be
                running  or  scheduled  to start running at a later time. If a
                journey's status is ACTIVE, you can't add, change,  or  remove
                activities from it.

              o COMPLETED  -  The  journey has been published and has finished
                running. All participants have entered the journey and no par-
                ticipants  are  waiting to complete the journey or any activi-
                ties in the journey.

              o CANCELLED - The journey has been stopped. If a journey's  sta-
                tus  is CANCELLED, you can't add, change, or remove activities
                or segment settings from the journey.

                ning.  It  may  have  also  passed  its scheduled end time, or
                passed its scheduled start time and a refresh frequency hasn't
                been  specified  for  it. If a journey's status is CLOSED, you
                can't add participants to it, and no existing participants can
                enter  the  journey  for the first time. However, any existing
                participants who are currently waiting to  start  an  activity
                may continue the journey.
