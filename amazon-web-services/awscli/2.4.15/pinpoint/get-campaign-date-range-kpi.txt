SYNOPSIS
            get-campaign-date-range-kpi
          --application-id <value>
          --campaign-id <value>
          [--end-time <value>]
          --kpi-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --campaign-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the campaign.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The last date and time to retrieve data for, as part of an inclusive
          date range that filters the query results. This value should  be  in
          extended  ISO  8601 format and use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
          for example: 2019-07-26T20:00:00Z for 8:00 PM UTC July 26, 2019.

       --kpi-name (string)
          The name of the metric, also referred to as a key performance  indi-
          cator (KPI) , to retrieve data for. This value describes the associ-
          ated metric and consists of two or more terms, which  are  comprised
          of  lowercase  alphanumeric characters, separated by a hyphen. Exam-
          ples are email-open-rate and successful-delivery-rate. For a list of
          valid values, see the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide .

       --next-token (string)
          The string that specifies which page of results to return in a pagi-
          nated response. This parameter is  not  supported  for  application,
          campaign, and journey metrics.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  first  date and time to retrieve data for, as part of an inclu-
          sive date range that filters the query results. This value should be
          in  extended  ISO  8601  format  and  use Coordinated Universal Time
          (UTC), for example: 2019-07-19T20:00:00Z for 8:00 PM  UTC  July  19,
          2019.  This value should also be fewer than 90 days from the current
          day.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
