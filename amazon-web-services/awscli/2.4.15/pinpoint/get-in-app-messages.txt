NAME
       get-in-app-messages -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the in-app messages targeted for the provided endpoint ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-in-app-messages
          --application-id <value>
          --endpoint-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --endpoint-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the endpoint.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                   and,  EXCLUSIVE,  endpoints  that match the
                                   criteria are excluded from the segment.

                               Values -> (list)
                                   The criteria values to use for the  segment
                                   dimension.  Depending  on  the value of the
                                   DimensionType   property,   endpoints   are
                                   included  or  excluded  from the segment if
                                   their values match the criteria values.

                                   (string)

                            Metrics -> (map)
                               One or more custom metrics that  your  applica-
                               tion  reports  to  Amazon Pinpoint. You can use
                               these metrics as selection  criteria  when  you
                               create an event filter.

                               key -> (string)

                               value -> (structure)
                                   Specifies metric-based criteria for includ-
                                   ing or excluding endpoints from a  segment.
                                   These  criteria  derive from custom metrics
                                   that you define for endpoints.

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The operator to use when comparing  met-
                                      ric    values.    Valid    values   are:
                                      GREATER_THAN,                 LESS_THAN,
                                      GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
                                      LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, and EQUAL.

                                   Value -> (double)
                                      The value to compare.

                        FilterType -> (string)
                            The type of event that causes the campaign  to  be
                            sent. Valid values are: SYSTEM, sends the campaign
                            when a system event occurs; and,  ENDPOINT,  sends
                            the  campaign  when  an  endpoint event (Eventsre-
                            source) occurs.

                     QuietTime -> (structure)
                        Time during which the in-app  message  should  not  be
                        shown to the user.

                        End -> (string)
                            The specific time when quiet time ends. This value
                            has to use 24-hour notation and be in  HH:MM  for-
                            mat, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero, if
                            applicable) and MM is the  minutes.  For  example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                        Start -> (string)
                            The specific time when  quiet  time  begins.  This
                            value  has to use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM
                            format, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero,
                            if applicable) and MM is the minutes. For example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                 SessionCap -> (integer)
                     Session  cap which controls the number of times an in-app
                     message can be shown to the endpoint during  an  applica-
                     tion session.

                 TotalCap -> (integer)
                     Total  cap  which  controls the number of times an in-app
                     message can be shown to the endpoint.

                 TreatmentId -> (string)
                     Treatment id of the campaign.



                                                         GET-IN-APP-MESSAGES()
