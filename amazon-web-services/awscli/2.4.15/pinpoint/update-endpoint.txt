UPDATE-ENDPOINT()                                            UPDATE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       update-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new endpoint for an application or updates the settings and
       attributes of an existing endpoint for an application. You can also use
       this  operation  to  define  custom  attributes  for an endpoint. If an
       update includes one or more values for a custom attribute, Amazon  Pin-
       point replaces (overwrites) any existing values with the new values.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-endpoint
          --application-id <value>
          --endpoint-id <value>
          --endpoint-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --endpoint-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the endpoint.

       --endpoint-request (structure)
          Specifies the channel type and other settings for an endpoint.

          Address -> (string)
              The destination address for messages or push notifications  that
              you  send  to the endpoint. The address varies by channel. For a
              push-notification channel, use the token provided  by  the  push
              notification service, such as an Apple Push Notification service
              (APNs) device token or a Firebase Cloud Messaging  (FCM)  regis-
              tration  token. For the SMS channel, use a phone number in E.164
              format, such as +12065550100. For  the  email  channel,  use  an
              email address.

          Attributes -> (map)
              One  or  more  custom  attributes  that describe the endpoint by
              associating a name with an array of  values.  For  example,  the
              value  of  a  custom  attribute named Interests might be: ["Sci-
              ence", "Music", "Travel"]. You can use these attributes as  fil-
              ter  criteria when you create segments. Attribute names are case
              sensitive.

              An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters. An  attribute
              value can contain up to 100 characters. When you define the name
              of a custom attribute, avoid  using  the  following  characters:
              number sign (#), colon (:), question mark (?), backslash (), and
              slash (/). The Amazon Pinpoint console can't  display  attribute
              names  that  contain  these characters. This restriction doesn't
              apply to attribute values.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

          ChannelType -> (string)
              The channel to use when sending messages or  push  notifications
              to the endpoint.

          Demographic -> (structure)
              The  demographic  information for the endpoint, such as the time
              zone and platform.

              AppVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the app that's associated with the endpoint.

              Locale -> (string)
                 The locale of the endpoint, in the following format: the  ISO
                 639-1  alpha-2  code, followed by an underscore (_), followed
                 by an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 value.

              Make -> (string)
                 The manufacturer of the endpoint device,  such  as  apple  or

              Model -> (string)
                 The  model  name  or  number  of the endpoint device, such as
                 iPhone or SM-G900F.

              ModelVersion -> (string)
                 The model version of the endpoint device.

              Platform -> (string)
                 The platform of the endpoint device, such as ios.

              PlatformVersion -> (string)
                 The platform version of the endpoint device.

              Timezone -> (string)
                 The time zone of the endpoint, specified  as  a  tz  database
                 name value, such as America/Los_Angeles.

          EffectiveDate -> (string)
              The  date  and  time,  in  ISO 8601 format, when the endpoint is
              updated.

          EndpointStatus -> (string)
              Specifies whether to send messages or push notifications to  the
              endpoint.  Valid  values  are:  ACTIVE, messages are sent to the
              endpoint; and, INACTIVE, messages arent sent to the endpoint.

              Amazon Pinpoint automatically sets this value to ACTIVE when you
              create  an  endpoint or update an existing endpoint. Amazon Pin-
              point automatically sets this value to INACTIVE  if  you  update
              another  endpoint  that  has  the  same address specified by the
              Address property.

          Location -> (structure)

                 US for the United States.

              Latitude -> (double)
                 The latitude coordinate of the endpoint location, rounded  to
                 one decimal place.

              Longitude -> (double)
                 The longitude coordinate of the endpoint location, rounded to
                 one decimal place.

              PostalCode -> (string)
                 The postal or ZIP code for the area  where  the  endpoint  is
                 located.

              Region -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  region where the endpoint is located. For
                 locations in the United States, this value is the name  of  a
                 state.

          Metrics -> (map)

          OptOut -> (string)
              Specifies whether the user who's associated  with  the  endpoint
              has  opted out of receiving messages and push notifications from
              you. Possible values are:  ALL,  the  user  has  opted  out  and
              doesn't want to receive any messages or push notifications; and,
              NONE, the user hasn't opted out and wants to  receive  all  mes-
              sages and push notifications.

          RequestId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier for the most recent request to update the
              endpoint.

          User -> (structure)
              One or more custom attributes that describe the user who's asso-
              ciated with the endpoint.

              UserAttributes -> (map)
                 One or more custom attributes that describe the user by asso-
                 ciating a name with an array  of  values.  For  example,  the
                 value  of  an attribute named Interests might be: ["Science",
                 "Music", "Travel"]. You can use these  attributes  as  filter
                 criteria  when  you create segments. Attribute names are case
                 sensitive.

                 An attribute  name  can  contain  up  to  50  characters.  An
                 attribute  value  can  contain up to 100 characters. When you
                 define the name of a custom attribute, avoid using  the  fol-
                 lowing  characters: number sign (#), colon (:), question mark
                 (?), backslash (), and slash (/). The Amazon Pinpoint console
                 can't  display attribute names that contain these characters.
                 This restriction doesn't apply to attribute values.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

          Message -> (string)
              The message that's returned from the API.

          RequestID -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the request or response.
