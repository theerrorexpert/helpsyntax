DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information about the status and settings of the export jobs
       for a segment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-segment-export-jobs
          --application-id <value>
          [--page-size <value>]
          --segment-id <value>
          [--token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --segment-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the segment.

       --token (string)
          The  NextToken string that specifies which page of results to return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExportJobsResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about all the export jobs that  are  associated
          with  an application or segment. An export job is a job that exports
          endpoint definitions to a file.

          Item -> (list)
              An array of responses, one for each export job that's associated
              with  the application (Export Jobs resource) or segment (Segment
              Export Jobs resource).

              (structure)
                 Provides information about the status and settings of  a  job
                 that  exports endpoint definitions to a file. The file can be
                 added directly to an Amazon Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon
                 S3)  bucket  by  using  the Amazon Pinpoint API or downloaded
                 directly to a computer by using the Amazon Pinpoint  console.

                 ApplicationId -> (string)
                     The  unique identifier for the application that's associ-
                     ated with the export job.

                 CompletedPieces -> (integer)
                     The number of pieces  that  were  processed  successfully
                     (completed)  by  the  export  job,  as of the time of the
                     request.

                 CompletionDate -> (string)
                     The date, in ISO 8601 format, when  the  export  job  was
                     completed.

                 CreationDate -> (string)
                     The  date,  in  ISO  8601 format, when the export job was
                     created.

                 Definition -> (structure)
                     The resource settings that apply to the export job.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and
                        Access  Management  (IAM)  role that authorized Amazon
                        Pinpoint to access the Amazon S3  location  where  the
                        endpoint definitions were exported to.

                     S3UrlPrefix -> (string)

                        tions  were  exported to. This location is typically a
                        folder that contains multiple files. The URL should be
                        in           the           following           format:

                        present, Amazon Pinpoint exported definitions for  all
                        the  endpoints  that  are associated with the applica-
                        tion.

                        The version of the segment that the  endpoint  defini-

                     (failed) by the  export  job,  as  of  the  time  of  the
                     request.

                 Failures -> (list)
                     An  array  of  entries,  one  for  each  of the first 100

                     in the job.

                 TotalFailures -> (integer)
                     The  total  number  of  endpoint definitions that weren't
                     processed successfully (failed) by the export job,  typi-

                     plete  the export job. Each piece consists of an approxi-
                     mately equal portion of the endpoint definitions that are
                     part of the export job.

                 TotalProcessed -> (integer)
                     The  total  number of endpoint definitions that were pro-
