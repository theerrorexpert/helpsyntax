NAME
       list-journeys -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about the status, configuration, and other set-
       tings for all the journeys that are associated with an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-journeys
          --application-id <value>
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --token (string)
          The  NextToken string that specifies which page of results to return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JourneysResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status, configuration, and other set-
          tings  for all the journeys that are associated with an application.

          Item -> (list)
              An array of responses, one for each  journey  that's  associated
              with the application.

              (structure)
                 Provides  information  about  the  status, configuration, and
                 other settings for a journey.

                 Activities -> (map)
                     A map that contains a set of Activity objects, one object
                     for  each  activity  in  the  journey.  For each Activity
                     object, the key is the unique identifier (string) for  an
                     activity  and the value is the settings for the activity.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Specifies the configuration and other settings for  an
                        activity in a journey.

                        CUSTOM -> (structure)
                            The  settings  for a custom message activity. This
                            type of activity calls an AWS Lambda  function  or
                            web hook that sends messages to participants.

                            DeliveryUri -> (string)
                               The  destination to send the campaign or treat-
                               ment to. This value can be one of  the  follow-
                               ing:

                               o The  name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an
                                 AWS  Lambda  function  to  invoke  to  handle
                                 delivery of the campaign or treatment.

                               o The URL for a web application or service that
                                 supports HTTPS and can receive  the  message.
                                 The  URL  has to be a full URL, including the
                                 HTTPS protocol.

                            EndpointTypes -> (list)
                               The types of endpoints to send the custom  mes-
                               sage  to.  Each  valid  value maps to a type of
                               channel that you can associate with an endpoint
                               by  using  the  ChannelType property of an end-
                               point.

                               (string)

                            MessageConfig -> (structure)
                               Specifies the message data included in a custom
                               channel  message that's sent to participants in
                               a journey.

                               Data -> (string)
                                   The message content that's passed to an AWS
                                   Lambda function or to a web hook.

                            NextActivity -> (string)
                               The  unique identifier for the next activity to
                               perform, after Amazon Pinpoint  calls  the  AWS
                               Lambda function or web hook.

                            TemplateName -> (string)
                               The  name of the custom message template to use
                               for the message. If specified, this value  must
                               match the name of an existing message template.

                            TemplateVersion -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the  version  of  the
                               message  template  to  use  for the message. If
                               specified, this value must match the identifier
                               for an existing template version. To retrieve a
                               list of versions and version identifiers for  a
                               template, use the Template Versionsresource.

                               If you don't specify a value for this property,
                               Amazon Pinpoint uses the active version of  the
                               template.  The  active version is typically the
                               version of a template that's been most recently
                               reviewed  and  approved  for  use, depending on
                               your workflow. It isn't necessarily the  latest
                               version of a template.

                        ConditionalSplit -> (structure)
                            The  settings  for  a  yes/no split activity. This
                            type of activity sends participants  down  one  of
                            two  paths  in a journey, based on conditions that
                            you specify.

                            Condition -> (structure)
                               The conditions that define the  paths  for  the
                               activity, and the relationship between the con-
                               ditions.

                               Conditions -> (list)
                                   The conditions to evaluate for  the  activ-

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a condition to evaluate for an
                                      activity in a journey.

                                      EventCondition -> (structure)
                                          The dimension settings for the event
                                          that's associated with the activity.

                                          Dimensions -> (structure)
                                             The dimensions for the event fil-
                                             ter to use for the activity.

                                             Attributes -> (map)
                                                 One or more custom attributes
                                                 that your application reports
                                                 to  Amazon  Pinpoint. You can
                                                 use   these   attributes   as
                                                 selection  criteria  when you
                                                 create an event filter.

                                                 key -> (string)

                                                 value -> (structure)

                                                    excluding endpoints from a
                                                    segment.

                                                    AttributeType -> (string)
                                                        The  type  of  segment
                                                        dimension   to    use.

                            TemplateVersion -> (string)
                               The  unique  identifier  for the version of the
                               email template to use for the message. If spec-

                               an existing template  version.  To  retrieve  a
                               list  of versions and version identifiers for a
                               template, use the Template Versionsresource.

                               If you don't specify a value for this property,
                               Amazon  Pinpoint uses the active version of the
                               template. The active version is  typically  the
                               version of a template that's been most recently
                               reviewed and approved  for  use,  depending  on
                               your  workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest
                               version of a template.

                        Holdout -> (structure)
                            The settings for a holdout activity. This type  of
                            activity  stops a journey for a specified percent-
                            age of participants.

                            NextActivity -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the next activity  to
                               perform, after performing the holdout activity.

                            Percentage -> (integer)
                               The percentage of  participants  who  shouldn't
                               continue the journey.

                               To  determine  which participants are held out,
                               Amazon  Pinpoint  applies  a  probability-based
                               algorithm  to  the percentage that you specify.
                               Therefore, the actual  percentage  of  partici-
                               pants  who are held out may not be equal to the
                               percentage that you specify.

                                                 that your application reports
                                                 to  Amazon  Pinpoint. You can
                                                 use   these   attributes   as
                                                 selection  criteria  when you
                                                 create an event filter.

                                                 key -> (string)

                                                 value -> (structure)

                                   sent to  a  push-notification  service.  If
                                   this  value  is  0,  the service treats the
                                   notification as if it  expires  immediately
                                   and  the  service  doesn't  store or try to
                                   deliver the notification again.

                               The unique identifier for the next activity  to
                               perform, after the message is sent.

                            TemplateName -> (string)

                               use for the message. If specified,  this  value
                               must match the name of an existing message tem-
                               plate.

                            TemplateVersion -> (string)

                               push  notification template to use for the mes-
                               sage. If specified, this value must  match  the
                               identifier for an existing template version. To
                               retrieve a list of versions and version identi-
                               fiers for a template, use the Template Version-

                               template. The active version is  typically  the
                               version of a template that's been most recently
                               reviewed and approved  for  use,  depending  on
                               your  workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest

                                      down  each path, Amazon Pinpoint applies
                                      a  probability-based  algorithm  to  the
                                      percentages  that  you  specify  for the
                                      paths. Therefore, the actual  percentage
                                      of participants who are sent down a path
                                      may not be equal to the percentage  that
                                      you specify.

                       Time.End property for the journey.

                     If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, the partic-
                     ipant  will  receive  messages  from the journey, even if

                        and  MM is the minutes. For example, use 02:30 to rep-
                        resent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.

                     Start -> (string)
                        The specific time when quiet time begins.  This  value
                        has  to  use  24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format,
                        where HH is the hour (with a leading zero, if applica-
                        ble)  and MM is the minutes. For example, use 02:30 to
                        represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.

                       status is CLOSED, you can't add participants to it, and
                       no  existing participants can enter the journey for the
                       first time. However, any existing participants who  are
                       currently waiting to start an activity may continue the
                       journey.
