UPDATE-ENDPOINTS-BATCH()                              UPDATE-ENDPOINTS-BATCH()



NAME
       update-endpoints-batch -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new batch of endpoints for an application or updates the set-
       tings and attributes of a batch of existing endpoints for  an  applica-
       tion. You can also use this operation to define custom attributes for a
       batch of endpoints. If an update includes one or more values for a cus-
       tom  attribute, Amazon Pinpoint replaces (overwrites) any existing val-
       ues with the new values.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-endpoints-batch
          --application-id <value>
          --endpoint-batch-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --endpoint-batch-request (structure)
          Specifies  a batch of endpoints to create or update and the settings
          and attributes to set or change for each endpoint.

          Item -> (list)
              An array that defines the endpoints to create or update and, for
              each  endpoint,  the  property values to set or change. An array
              can contain a maximum of 100 items.

              (structure)
                 Specifies an endpoint to create or update  and  the  settings
                 and attributes to set or change for the endpoint.

                 Address -> (string)
                     The  destination  address  for messages or push notifica-
                     tions that you send to the endpoint. The  address  varies
                     by  channel.  For  a  push-notification  channel, use the
                     token provided by the push notification service, such  as
                     an Apple Push Notification service (APNs) device token or
                     a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) registration token.  For
                     the SMS channel, use a phone number in E.164 format, such
                     as +12065550100. For the  email  channel,  use  an  email
                     address.

                 Attributes -> (map)
                     One  or more custom attributes that describe the endpoint
                     by associating a name with an array of values. For  exam-
                     ple,  the  value  of  a  custom attribute named Interests
                     might be: ["Science", "Music",  "Travel"].  You  can  use
                     these  attributes as filter criteria when you create seg-
                     ments. Attribute names are case sensitive.

                     An attribute name can contain up  to  50  characters.  An
                     attribute  value  can  contain up to 100 characters. When
                     you define the name of a custom  attribute,  avoid  using
                     the  following  characters:  number  sign (#), colon (:),
                     question mark (?), backslash (), and slash (/). The  Ama-
                     zon  Pinpoint  console can't display attribute names that
                     contain these characters. This restriction doesn't  apply
                     to attribute values.

                        base name value, such as America/Los_Angeles.

                 EffectiveDate -> (string)
                     The  date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the endpoint

                 EndpointStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies whether to send messages or push  notifications
                     to  the  endpoint. Valid values are: ACTIVE, messages are
                     sent to the endpoint; and, INACTIVE, messages arent  sent
                     to the endpoint.

                     Amazon  Pinpoint  automatically sets this value to ACTIVE
                     when you create an endpoint or update  an  existing  end-
                     point.  Amazon  Pinpoint automatically sets this value to
                     INACTIVE if you update another endpoint that has the same
                     address specified by the Address property.

                 Id -> (string)

                        located. For example, US for the United States.

                     Latitude -> (double)
                        The latitude  coordinate  of  the  endpoint  location,
                        rounded to one decimal place.

                     Longitude -> (double)
                        The  longitude  coordinate  of  the endpoint location,
                        rounded to one decimal place.

                        For locations in the United States, this value is  the
                        name of a state.

                 Metrics -> (map)
                     One  or more custom metrics that your app reports to Ama-
                     zon Pinpoint for the endpoint.

                     key -> (string)

                     point  has opted out of receiving messages and push noti-
                     fications from you. Possible values are:  ALL,  the  user
                     has opted out and doesn't want to receive any messages or
                     push notifications; and, NONE, the user hasn't opted  out

                     The unique identifier for the request to create or update
                     the endpoint.

                 User -> (structure)
                     One  or  more  custom  attributes  that describe the user
                     who's associated with the endpoint.

                     UserAttributes -> (map)
                        One or more custom attributes that describe  the  user
                        by  associating  a  name  with an array of values. For
                        example, the value of  an  attribute  named  Interests
                        might  be: ["Science", "Music", "Travel"]. You can use
                        these attributes as filter criteria  when  you  create
                        segments. Attribute names are case sensitive.

                        An  attribute name can contain up to 50 characters. An
                        attribute value can contain up to 100 characters. When
                        you define the name of a custom attribute, avoid using
                        the following characters: number sign (#), colon  (:),
                        question  mark  (?),  backslash (), and slash (/). The
                        Amazon Pinpoint console can't display attribute  names
                        that   contain   these  characters.  This  restriction
                        doesn't apply to attribute values.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (list)
                            (string)

                     UserId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the user.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Provides information about an API request or response.

          Message -> (string)
              The message that's returned from the API.

          RequestID -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the request or response.
