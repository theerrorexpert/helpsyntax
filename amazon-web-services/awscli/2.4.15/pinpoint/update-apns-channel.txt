OPTIONS
       --apns-channel-request (structure)
          Specifies the status and settings of the APNs (Apple Push  Notifica-

          BundleId -> (string)
              The  bundle  identifier  that's  assigned  to your iOS app. This

          DefaultAuthenticationMethod -> (string)
              The default authentication method that you want Amazon  Pinpoint
              to use when authenticating with APNs, key or certificate.

          Enabled -> (boolean)

          TokenKeyId -> (string)
              The key identifier that's assigned to your APNs signing key,  if
              you  want Amazon Pinpoint to communicate with APNs by using APNs

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BundleId=string,Certificate=string,DefaultAuthenticationMethod=string,Enabled=boolean,PrivateKey=string,TeamId=string,TokenKey=string,TokenKeyId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BundleId": "string",
            "Certificate": "string",
            "DefaultAuthenticationMethod": "string",
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "PrivateKey": "string",
            "TeamId": "string",
            "TokenKey": "string",
            "TokenKeyId": "string"
          }

       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
